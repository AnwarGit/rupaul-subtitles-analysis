00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,400
-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,266
- Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.

3
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:09,000
I've got to shake this off
and move on.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,500
- You'll be debuting
an original drag ballet.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,767
- I can't dance.

6
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,200
- Coco, you pick first.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,166
- Alyssa Edwards.

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,567
- What the fuck?

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,800
- Here's what I want from you,
Jinkx.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,233
I want to see some glamour.

11
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,533
- The winner is Alyssa Edwards.

12
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,967
- [exhales with relief]

13
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,166
- Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,

14
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm sending you both home.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,867
Now, ladies, sashay away.

16
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,000
- Girl.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,700
- After the double elimination,

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,433
every girl knows Ru is not
playing the radio.

19
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:01,767
- Girl.

20
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,967
- Crack.

21
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,467
That's a sign of don't get
too comfortable.

22
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,700
- That was the closest I ever
want to get to the bottom.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,767
To be in the bottom three has
lit a fire under my ass.

24
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:12,867
Never again.

25
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:14,700
- I think everyone is just

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,734
shocked that Roxxxy Andrews
is in the bottom three.

27
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,500
But I'm not shocked.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,233
She's part of Rolaskatox, and

29
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,800
they've convinced themselves
that they're invincible.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,100
- But you won.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,300
- I wish she would have sent
all y'all bitches home.

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
[laughter]

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,533
- I want you to go home too,

34
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,567
bitch, so you don't throw me
in the bottom again.

35
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,333
Alyssa wanted to act
like she's so real,

36
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,834
but I think it was a pretty
bitchy-ass move to call

37
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,233
me out onstage.

38
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,934
- The one that I would want to
send home is not in this lineup.

39
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,934
I don't see Jade
at the same level.

40
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,567
If she would've asked me who
needed to go,

41
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,700
I would have said that,

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,200
because from the view
that I was getting,

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,333
it looked like a sausage
squeezed into a two-piece.

44
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,467
It was not pretty.

45
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:55,734
- You can't take it personal.

46
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,333
- You're a dirty bitch.

47
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,333
- It's not dirty.

48
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,767
I kept it real to your face.

49
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,133
If I wanted to be dirty, I would
have really, really read you.

50
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,133
Ha.

51
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,200
- Well, girl, if you read me,

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,467
I would have read you
right back.

53
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,667
- That's a part of the game,
baby.

54
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,500
Welcome to drag.

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,600
I knew coming into this

56
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
competition that the claws
would come out.

57
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
I don't want to scratch
anybody's eyes out.

58
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,767
I just want to scratch my way
to the top.

59
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,967
'Cause I'm what?

60
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,133
Sickening.

- Ooh.

94
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,300
- Into something
red carpet worthy.

95
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll decide who wore it best.

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,667
Ready, set, style.

- Damn.

99
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:05,500
- How am I supposed to wear
something so goddamn ugly?

100
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,433
- It'll be like everything else
you wear.

101
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:10,367
- How dare you?
- Oh, really?

102

- Uh, Ru?

111
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,867
Is that a Klein Epstein &amp; Parker
suit that you're wearing?

112
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,066
- Why, yes, it is.

113
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,734
What do you think?

114
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,066
- Well, I think, in this case,
Ru wore it best.

115
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,066
- Aw.

116
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,066

First up, wearing zebra,
Coco Montrese.

- Yes.
- Who wore it best?

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,567
- I'd have to say Detox.

- Ah, Detox.

130
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,700

- So, Ian, who wore it best?

142
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,066
The name on everybody's lips has
got to be Roxxxy.

143
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,567
- Roxxxy Andrews.

144
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,934
First up wearing pink,
Alyssa Edwards.

145
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:55,934
Who are the jewels by?

146
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:56,967

148
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,333

- The missing Olsen twin.

- Uh-huh.
- She just woke up.

156
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,633
- This way, Jinkx.

157
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,834
- I don't think Jinkx did
anything with the blanket.

158
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,734
She just put the blanket on
and gave it a character...

159
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,934
what she does best.

160
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,100
- All right, Ian.
So who wore it best?

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,600
- It is a stiff competition,
I will say.

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
- Oh.

163
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,166
- But it has to be
Alyssa Edwards.

164
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,266
- All right, Alyssa Edwards.

00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:22,600
- So what's everybody doing?

180
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,633
What you doing?

181
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:26,834
- You doing Katy?

182
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,066
- I'm doing Ke$ha.

183
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,600
- [laughs]

184
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,633
- Who are you doing, Alaska?

185
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:32,700
- Lady Bunny.

186
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,233
- Oh.

187
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,567
It's risky.

188
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,967
- And she just did Lady Bunny
in the last challenge.

189
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,900
- That's very risky.

190
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,233
- Who are you doing, Roxxxy?

191
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,200
- Tamar Braxton, honey.

192
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,900
- [laughs]
- Who?

193
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,333
- Tamar Braxton,
Toni Braxton's sister.

194
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,166
If you don't know her,
you're going to know her.

195
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,734
- Oh, is she coming to life
today?

196
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,300
- She coming to life tonight.

197
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,567
Tonight!

198
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,767
- This is something you should
be strong at, right?

199
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:58,800
- I'm hoping.

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,266
- What are you going to do?

201
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,133
- I'm going to do Little Edie
from<i> Grey Gardens.</i>

202
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,266
- Who--what?

203
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,734
- Little Edie from<i> </i>
<i>Grey Gardens.</i>

204
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,567
-<i> Grey Gardens?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Who is that?

205
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,700
- Who is it?

206
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,567
- So Jackie O. has this cousin
and this aunt

207
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,367
who went bankrupt
and became shut-ins,

208
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,433
living in a big,
dilapidated mansion.

209
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,300
Little Edie had alopecia and

210
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
lost all her hair out of the
stress,

211
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,266
and then she became a big
fashion icon

212
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,066
years after she died.

213
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,066
- Do you think a lot of people

214
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,767
are going to recognize
that character?

215
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,166
- Little Edie is a risky
character.

216
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,066
Not everyone's going to know
who she is.

217
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,533
But I think people should know
who she is.

218
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,600
Here's your pate, mother,
darling.

219
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
At least, I think it's pate.

220
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,700
The label's faded.

221
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,700
[both speaking Spanish]

222
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,700
- When you're dealing with
people judging what you do,

223
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,300
you just have to let it roll off
like water off a duck's back.

224
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,934
All right.

225
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,934
-<i> Coming up...</i>

226
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,734
Who are you doing?

227
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,533
- Michelle Obama.

228
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,834
- Michelle Obama?

229
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,834
Okay.

230
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,567
- This about to get real ugly.

231
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,467
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look.

232
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,667
- I'm not joking, bitch.

233
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,967
- [laughs]

234
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,967
[laughs]

235
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:18,233
- Our main challenge today is
to pick a celebrity character

236
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,100
and play them on
The Snatch Game.

237
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,266
- Freaking out.

238
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,200
- Are you scared you can't make
Ke$ha funny?

239
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,066
- I think I can make her funny.

240
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,100
- Snatch Game challenges your

241
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,600
improv skills, your wit,
and your impersonation skills.

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,700
Without these three things, a
drag queen might as well not

243
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,100
call herself a drag queen.

244
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
- Hello, hello, hello.

245
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
all: Hi.

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,467
- Ivy Winters.

247
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,867
- Hey, mama.

248
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,066
- Ah, who are you doing?

249
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,266
- Miss Monroe.

250
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,300
- Marilyn Monroe?

251
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,600
- Yes.

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,100
- How are you going to make
Marilyn Monroe funny?

253
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,166
- That's a good question.

254
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,734
[laughs]

255
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:57,233
Um, I think it's just relating
a lot to her movies.

256
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,066
Um...
- Yeah.

257
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,767
What about the funny part?

258
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,100
- I just have to be big
and blonde.

259
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,767
- Well, the tricky thing with
Marilyn, too,

260
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,000
is that she was
the smart dumb blonde.

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,166
So that sort of nuance
is not easy to do.

262
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,266
Get it going and make me laugh.

263
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,266
- I will.

264
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,633
- All right.

265
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,800
Alaska.

266
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
- Hi.

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,967
- 49th state.

268
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:22,934
- The biggest state.

269
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,934
- Oh, that's right.

270
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,500
It's like its own country.

271
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,533
- I'm my own continent.

272
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,500
- Oh.

273
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,533
- I'm incontinent, though.

274
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,433
- [laughs]

275
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,967
So who are you doing?

276
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,467
- I'm doing Lady Bunny.

277
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,133
- Ex-squeeze me?

278
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,567
Bunny is hilar--

279
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:41,467
I think she's actually the
funniest person I've ever met.

280
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,033
It's a tricky one.

281
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,700
I want you to be funnier
than Bunny.

282
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,133
- Okay.
- Okay?

283
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,433
- All right.

284
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,533
I'm scared shitless.

285
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:54,033
How the fuck am I supposed
to measure up to that?

286
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,066
- Hey, Coco.

287
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,266
- Hi, Ru.

288
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:59,600
- Now, okay, I'm getting
psychic feelings.

289
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,667
Um...

290
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,700
let me guess.

291
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,734
Margaret Thatcher?

292
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,734
- No, Ru.

293
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,767
Janet Jackson.

294
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,233
- I love me some Janet.

295
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,967
Now, what made you decide
to do Janet?

296
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,066
- I do Janet six nights a week
in Vegas.

297
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,100
- Really?
Six nights a week?

298
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,400
- Yes.

299
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,133
I really actually studied
everything about her onstage

300
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,200
and offstage.

301
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,333
So, if I don't know this
character,

302
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,367
then I shouldn't be doing drag.

303
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,433
- You got to bring the funny.
- Okay.

304
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,200
- All right.
Hi, Detox.

305
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,367
- Hi, Ru.

306
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,066
- I don't know who that could
be.

307
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:29,300
Let's see--Rachel Zoe
after a fire?

308
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,066
- No, I'm going to do my friend
Ke$ha.

309
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,100
- You're friends with Ke$ha?

310
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,367
- I've worked with her a few
times,

311
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,333
and I've done a bunch of her
music videos.

312
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,834
And, yeah, she's a lot of fun.

313
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,367
- Since you actually know Ke$ha,

314
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,333
how are you going to not sort of
hold back?

315
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,734
- I don't want to, like,
slander her too much.

316
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:47,066
- Well, that could be a problem.

317
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,367
You got to be willing
to make a fool

318
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,367
out of the person you're doing.

319
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,800
When the camera lands on you,

320
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,066
you have 30 seconds, from the
waist up, to make it happen.

321
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,400
Get back to work.
- Thank you.

322
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
- All right.
Hi, Jinkxy.

323
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,433
- Hi.

324
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,767
You caught me
with one eyebrow on.

325
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,567
- You are a quirky character.

326
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,433
I am just dying to find out...

327
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,533
who are you playing?

328
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,433
- Her name is
Little Edie Bouvier Beale.

329
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,600
- Jackie Kennedy's cousin.

330
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,900
- Yes.
- I love her.

331
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
But are you a little worried

332
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,633
that the audience at home
won't know who she is?

333
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:25,066
- It's a concern I had, but I
kept tossing around, you know,

334
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,066
pop icons I could do, and just--

335
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,166
none of them speak
to me the same way.

336
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,400
I landed on Little Edie because
I really relate to her,

337
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,900
and since I started in this
competition,

338
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,467
I feel even more connected
with her right now.

339
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,467
She's a little misunderstood.

340
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,800
- Yes, well, just make sure you

341
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,567
make Little Edie pop
for the unwashed masses.

342
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,934
- Mm-hmm.

343
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,734
- All right, well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.

344
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:47,934
I'm going to let you get to it.

345
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,834
All right.

346
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,467
Lineysha Sparx.

347
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,633
- Hello, RuPaul.

348
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,300
- Who are you doing?

349
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,567
- I'm going to do

350
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,433
Michelle Obama.

351
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,133
- Michelle Obama?
- Yes.

352
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,633
- That's an interesting choice.

353
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:03,367
What made you decide to do
Michelle Obama?

354
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,600
- Because I think that I can
look like her, and--

355
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,133
- It's more than just looking
like the person.

356
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,934
They have to be funny.

357
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,233
Can I hear a little bit
of your Michelle Obama?

358
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:17,066
What did you serve Obama
for breakfast this morning?

359
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,100
- French fries.

360
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,767
- Um...

361
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,533
french fries.

362
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,133
Yeah.

363
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:29,300
Michelle Obama,
how are your daughters?

364
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,400
- [laughs]
Aw.

365
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,867
- Who are your other choices?

366
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,333
- I really--
I was thinking Celia Cruz.

367
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,567
- Is a good choice.

368
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,867
- But...

369
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,967
right now I got this choice.

370
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,367
I think it's better.

371
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:45,166
Celia Cruz--she's the queen of
the salsa,

372
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,767
but I really know that I can
look like Michelle Obama,

373
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,533
so I'm not going to change.

374
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,133
- It's a tough sell--
Michelle Obama.

375
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,467
Just be funny.

376
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,066
Be funny.

377
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,767
- I'm Michelle Obama,
and I approve this message.

378
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,233
- Ladies, gather round.

379
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,900
Now, I'll see you on the set,

380
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,233
with our extra special
guest judges...

381
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:13,233
MTV royalty Julie Brown
and Downtown Julie Brown.

382
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,300
[all cheering]

383
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,967
Don't fuck it up.

384
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,300
all: Bye, Ru.

385
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
- Julie Brown!

386
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:28,400
- Girl, which one do you think
I should do--Katy or her?

387
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,767
Miss Kim--this is not Kim.

388
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,367
This is too platinum.

389
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm not 100% sold on Katy Perry.

390
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,900
I'm really thinking I should

391
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,800
probably switch to Kim from
<i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

392
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,066
Celebrity impersonation is not
part of my gig,

393
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:48,467
and that makes me second-guess
myself

394
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:52,400
and what is the right character
for me.

395
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,133
- I have my makeup
like Michelle Obama.

396
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,266
I have my wig.

397
00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:00,700
But I have in my mind the voice
of RuPaul.

398
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:08,266
- Do you know enough about
Michelle Obama to make it funny?

399
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,400
- Do you know enough about
Celia Cruz?

400
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,800
- Mm-mm.

401
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,867
My other option is Celia Cruz,

402
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,400
but I don't have the clothes.

403
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,600
I don't have the right wigs.

404
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,900
So...

405
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
I don't know.

406
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,467
- I'm worried about Lineysha

407
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,400
because I don't think she knows
what she's doing at this point.

408
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,300
She needs to get it together.

409
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,500
-<i> Coming up...</i>

410
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,567
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.

411
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,066
- Get your life.

412
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,567
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.

413
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,567
[laughter]

414
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,600
- [laughs]

415
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,900
[laughs]

416
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,066
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.

417
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,166
Today it's a battle
of the Browns.

418
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,667
She put the "wubba" in
"wubba, wubba, wubba."

419
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,667
Downtown Julie Brown!

420
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:00,333
And she's, like, totally
the original valley girl--

421
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,567
Julie Brown.

422
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,867
May I call you
"Uptown Julie Brown"?

423
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:06,367
- I prefer "just say Julie."

424
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,333
- [laughs]

425
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,300
Now let's meet
our celebrity panel.

426
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,066
Direct from Grey Gardens,
it's Little Edie Beale.

427
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,500
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.

428
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,066
- How is Big Edie doing?

429
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,200
- She's always begging for the
pate, but the label is faded.

430
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,533
I can never tell if it's pate or
if it's giblets for the cats.

431
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,734
[laughter]

432
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,633
- Next, don't break up with her

433
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,767
because she'll write a song
about it.

434
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,066
It's Taylor Swift.

435
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,400
- I can't believe I'm here.
This is so exciting.

436
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,467
[giggles]

437
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,734
- Next, my old, old, old, old,

438
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,066
old friend, Lady Bunny.

439
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,467
- You know, the last time I had
a battle of the Browns was about

440
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,734
ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.

441
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,367
- [laughs]

442
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,166
- Hey, Ke$ha.

443
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,567
- I just woke up here.

444
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,700
- You're at The Snatch Game,
honey.

445
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,934
- What's that?

446
00:16:55,934 --> 00:17:00,800
- Now it's the president of the
rhythm nation, Janet Jackson.

447
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,066
- Hi, Ru. How are you?

448
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,066
- What have you done for me
lately?

449
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,633
- I haven't put out a hit
in a while.

450
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,400
- Next, she's my teenage dream.

451
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,567
Hey, Katy Perry.

452
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,633
Oh, is that your fragrance?
- It is.

453
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,800
Would you like to try some?

454
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
- No.

455
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,266
- Okay.

456
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,867
- Good-bye, Norma Jean.

457
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,233
Hello, Marilyn Monroe.

458
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,400
- Hello, Ru.

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,433
- Now, is it true that gentlemen
prefer blondes?

460
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,533
- Oh, they do.
You know it.

461
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,767
- Fabulous.

462
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:33,433
Next up, it's the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.

463
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,166
<i>Hola!</i>

464
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,533
- I'm very fine here.

465
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:41,200
My English is
no very good-looking.

466
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,767
- Last but not least, it's
Braxton family bad girl...

467
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,567
Tamar Braxton.

468
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,834
- Get your life!

469
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,467
- What's Toni really like?
- Girl, who cares?

470
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,533
This is my first gig without
Toni, and I am so excited.

471
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,667
Boom!

472
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,500
[laughter]

473
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,800
- Okay, here's how the game
works.

474
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,100
I ask the question.

475
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,934
Our celebrity panel fills
in the blanks.

476
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:08,066
And you give an answer that you
think will match.

477
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:11,066
First question for Julie Brown.

478
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:14,200
Lady Bunny is so over politics.

479
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,367
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just blanks.

480
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,333
- Pleasures herself
with the voting wand.

481
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,467
- Let's hear what our
celebrities have to say.

482
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:24,567
- Little Edie?

483
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,266
- Well, I don't know her
personally,

484
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,533
but she looks older than mother
darling, so I said,

485
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:33,200
when she steps into the voting
booth, she just seizures.

486
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Spelling?

487
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
- Seize--[laughs]

488
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,533
[laughter]

489
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,700
Not a match.

490
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,066
Moving on to Celia Cruz,
the queen of salsa.

491
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,767
Lady Bunny is so over politics.

492
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,800
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just...

493
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:52,066
- Flip her hair back and forth.

494
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:54,500
- I think it's "whip your hair
back and forth."

495
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,367
- Uh-huh.
-<i> Si.</i>

496
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,567
- Uh-huh,<i> si.</i>

497
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,533
- No el match-o.
- No match-o?

498
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,266
- No.

499
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,700
All right, we're going to the
original material girl,

500
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,100
Marilyn Monroe.

501
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,767
- She passes out.

502
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:11,133
I think if it was me, it'd be
the hard decision-making.

503
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,967
I get a little bit light-headed
sometimes.

504
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,500
- Now, you're into politics,
aren't you?

505
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,734
Presidents and...

506
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,633
- Ivy totally didn't get the
joke.

507
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,433
It was an awkward moment.

508
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,066
- Quite the scandal, actually.

509
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,867
[laughter]
With my cousin-in-law, really?

510
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:28,967
- [laughs] Yes.

511
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,333
- It was in all the magazines
at the time.

512
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,400
[laughter]

513
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,500
- All right, next question is
for Downtown Julie Brown.

514
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,600
- Yes.

515
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,333
- Heather the hoarder is such
a mess.

516
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,967
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.

517
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,934
- When she opens her box.

518
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,834
- Let's see if we get a match
from Taylor Swift.

519
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:54,266
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.

520
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,633
- Falls out of her Taylor Swift
lunchbox.

521
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,767
- Oh, that's a match!

522
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,266
She's got box!

523
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,767
All right, let's move on
to Katy Perry.

524
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,800
- Hi, Ru.

525
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,233
- Did you really kiss a girl?

526
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,633
Have you ever kissed a girl?

527
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,867
- [gasps] Ru, never.

528
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,467
- But--uh, yeah.

529
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,767
Have you ever fucked
a black guy?

530
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,967
[laughter]

531
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,166
Okay, okay.

532
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,734
Heather the hoarder
is such a mess.

533
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:22,367
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.

534
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,734
- Her clutch.

535
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,533
- Sorry.
Not a match.

536
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,033
- I think that immunity for

537
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,433
Alyssa is gonna come in real
handy this week.

538
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,934
- Lady Bunny, same question.

539
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:36,467
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.

540
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:39,166
- Well, Julie,
I just wrote "anus."

541
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,834
[laughter]

542
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,467
- Same neighborhood--
not a match.

543
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,467
[all awwing]

544
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,834
Next question is
for Julie Brown.

545
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,867
Lady Gaga has finally gone
too far.

546
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:57,166
She wore a dress made of blank.

547
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,533
- Madonna's leftovers.

548
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,433
- Madonna's leftovers!

549
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,567
Let's go to the stars.

550
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,900
Ke$ha, she wore a dress made
of blank.

551
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,266
- I said "her stupid monsters,"

552
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,300
'cause my animals
are fucking badass.

553
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,433
- Oh, right, that's what you
pop stars call your fans.

554
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,700
- Yeah.

555
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,233
- Let's move on to the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.

556
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,600
- Hey, hey.

557
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,867
- She wore a dress made
of blank.

558
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:24,500
"A can of tomato salsa."

559
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,467
- Like a big can.

560
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,633
- [imitates buzzing]

561
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,934
Flat.

562
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:33,934
- All right.

563
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,800
- [scatting]

564
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,500
- Tamar, Lady Gaga's finally
gone too far.

565
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,533
Last week she wore a dress made
of blank.

566
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,867
- Boom!
Who cares?

567
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,667
I'm so sick and tired of hearing
about that bitch.

568
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,700
[laughter]

569
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,734
Tamar's world.

570
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,066
- That's right.

571
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,533
Moving on--this one's for
Downtown Julie Brown.

572
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,133
Paula Deen is out of control.

573
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:59,500
This morning she put a stick
of butter on her blank.

574
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,367
- On her toothbrush.
- On her toothbrush!

575
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,300
- [laughs]
- Miss Janet Jackson.

576
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,967
- I think she put it
in her panty liner.

577
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:08,433
- Panty liner.
- I did too.

578
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,567
You want to see what happened?

579
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,100
- Yes.

580
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,200
Oh, my goodness.

581
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Oh, my goodness!

582
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,400
- Oh, my God, it's so thin.

583
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,066
- That's impressive.

584
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,233
- Coco's voice as Janet
was so perfect.

585
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:23,600
But she wasn't able
to make it funny.

586
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,734
- Ru, may I ask you why you

587
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:27,567
couldn't have gotten me real
celebrities for this game?

588
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,967
- Well...

589
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:32,934
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.

590
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,367
You could have gotten
Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn

591
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:37,500
or any one of them.

592
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,667
Instead you got ketchup.

593
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,633
- Ketchup?

594
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,834
- And that must be
Janice Jickson?

595
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:43,834
- Can I ask you a question, Ru?

596
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,433
- Yes, you can ask me
a question.

597
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,800
- What's a Little Edie?

598
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,066
- Little Edie is a star of
a movie,<i> Grey Gardens.</i>

599
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:55,333
- Okay, well,
she's not that little.

600
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,233
Who the hell is Little Edie?

601
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,900
I didn't know what that is.

602
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,700
- Okay, moving on--

603
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,333
[singsong] Tamar Braxton.

604
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,367
- Get your life!

605
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,600
- Now, Paula Deen
is out of control.

606
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,100
This morning she put a stick
of butter...

607
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,400
- On her--boom--Louboutins,

608
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,567
'cause her fat-ass feet
don't fit in 'em.

609
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,734
[laughter]

610
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:16,800
- I really have to pee.

611
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,934
[record scratches]

612
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:18,934
Can I pee?

613
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,600
- Just a--in just one second.

614
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,934
We're get--we're almost done.

615
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,400
- I'm gonna go ahead and pee
over here by Tamar.

616
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,533
- She's gonna go pee in the
corner.

617
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,800
- [laughing]

618
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,633
[liquid rushing]

619
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,367
Ke$ha!

620
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,600
- Do you have toilet paper?

621
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,800
- Yeah, I'll get somebody
to clean that up.

622
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,333
- Thanks, Ru.

623
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,133
- Detox bathroom break?

624
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,867
[mouthing] Gross.

625
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:44,166
- All right, I'm afraid we've
run out of time.

626
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,300
And the winner is...

627
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,734
who cares?

628
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:50,066
[laughter and applause]

629
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,266
Thanks for joining us, everyone.

630
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,900
Until next time, RuPaul out.

631
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,300
Say good night, stars!

632
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,667
both: Good night, stars.

633
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,633
-<i> Coming up...</i>

634
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,767
- I don't understand why you're

635
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:01,834
really trying to, like,
come for me.

636
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,100
- Girl, you came for me.

637
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,633
- It just came off as
"annoying skank."

638
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,667
- [laughs]

639
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,066
[laughs]

640
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,066
- Ro...

641
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,166
- Laska...

642
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,300
- Tox.

643
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,200
- It's elimination day, and

644
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,834
with a challenge
like The Snatch Game,

645
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,867
it's definitely a lot more
intense.

646
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,967
- Alyssa, are you glad you had
immunity?

647
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,734
[all oohing]

648
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,100
- I don't do characters.

649
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,800
I mean, this was going to be the
hardest challenge for me,

650
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,066
period.

651
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:35,100
- At this point, we know Snatch
Game is gonna happen.

652
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
- Right.

653
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,500
- You should already have a plan

654
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,767
from the moment you audition.

655
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,600
- America's Next Drag Superstar

656
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,333
is not going to travel the
country being a comedian.

657
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,967
She needs to be sickening.

658
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,834
Do the math.

659
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,533
Jinkx, on the runway, I think

660
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,233
you should've prepared more
than one look.

661
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,533
- Honey, all your outfits
haven't been that clean either.

662
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:56,967
What you wore--that gold the
other day--

663
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:59,500
some people shouldn't come down
to wear a two-piece,

664
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,200
because the view that I had in
the safe zone was not too cute.

665
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,066
- I don't understand why you're
trying to, like, come for me.

666
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,133
I mean--

667
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,400
- Girl, you came for me, right
out there,

668
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,567
threw me under the fuckin' bus.

669
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,867
- You're still mad about that,
girl?

670
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,066
I mean, are you intrigued
or something?

671
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,633
- No, honey--
- Obsess much?

672
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:15,767
- That's one thing I ain't.
One thing I'm not is intrigued.

673
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,467
- Jade, I can speak up
for myself.

674
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,433
Alyssa, every week I've done
a different look.

675
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,834
Like, one time I was space age.

676
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:22,967
The next time I was
Marie Antoinette.

677
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,200
- No, no, no, no, some people

678
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,967
are coming down the runway
in complete bullshit.

679
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,333
Had I pulled that on the runway,

680
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:34,367
they would have ripped me
to shreds, and y'all know it.

681
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:39,166
Jinkx--she's all comedy
and no glamour.

682
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,500
I don't think from day one,

683
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,133
she's put anything on the runway
worth looking at.

684
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:48,066
- I have dealt with this my
entire drag career, you know?

685
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,300
It's getting frustrating to have

686
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,066
to defend a style of drag
that's completely valid.

687
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,667
When I first got to Seattle,

688
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,400
because I'm kind of quirky,

689
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,633
not a lot of queens took me
very seriously.

690
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:00,834
- Girl, what if I just went out
there

691
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,500
and not even brushed its hair?

692
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,133
I'ma say, "Well, I was trying
to make it funny.

693
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,233
Everything got to be funny,
right?"

694
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,233
- [voice breaking] Every time
I step into something new,

695
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,533
I have to fight this fight
again.

696
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,767
I don't want to have to keep
explaining myself.

697
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:21,967
- Miss Coco, you're gonna have

698
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,667
to do a little bit more pink
in the eye.

699
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,166
- You concerned about what's
going on over here when

700
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,800
you need to be worried about
what's going over there with

701
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,967
that same makeup you've been

702
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,767
running on the runway
every single time.

703
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,633
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look, girl.

704
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,066
- Don't start with me.

705
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,066
- You're used to being my
runner-up and being behind me.

706
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,266
Don't switch the game up now,
mama.

707
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,533
- Okay, now, miss Alyssa...

708
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,533
[others whooping]

709
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:40,700
- Now you pushed it.

710
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,200
- Miss Coco, you're taking it
personal.

711
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,233
I'm joking with you.

712
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,100
- Oh, now I'm not joking, bitch!

713
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
You gonna call me a runner-up?

714
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,767
- You ain't never won nothing.

715
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,467
By default, mama--

716
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:52,633
you take that picture
by default.

717
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:53,800
- No, I took that picture

718
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,934
'cause you couldn't do the job,
bitch.

719
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,800
- I got that moment, though.

720
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,667
- She got the crown
put on her head.

721
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,333
She got to feel the emotion
of that moment.

722
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,834
She took that away from me.

723
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll be damned if I let her take
that away from me here...

724
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,900
not without a fight.

725
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
This about to get real ugly.

726
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,433
- You know what's ugly?
Poverty.

727
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,934
[laughter]

728
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:20,367
- The Jade!
- The Jade of it all.

729
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:38,500
-<i> And what?</i>

730
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,800
[light applause]

731
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,133
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

732
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:46,100
Michelle Visage,
are you ready to play?

733
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,333
- Always.

734
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,967
- Santino's in the house.

735
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,667

tonight, Ru.

736
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,533
- [laughs]

737
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,667
- Downtown Julie Brown,
do you feel lucky?

738
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,734
- Very lucky.

739
00:27:57,734 --> 00:28:00,500
- And the hilarious Julie Brown.

740
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,600
Did you have fun yesterday?

741
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,834
- I had such a great time.

742
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,200
- Tonight the queens are

743
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,800
serving their own girlish
glamour on the runway.

744
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,166
Category is...

745
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,266
deadliest snatch.

746
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,533
Gentlemen, start your engines,

747
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,700
and may the best woman win.

748
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,300
<i>Commence shake down.</i>

750
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,400
First up, Ivy Winters.

751
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Goldfish.

752
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,467
- It's little she-mo!

753
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:26,734
-<i> I'm strutting down the runway,</i>

754
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:29,133
<i>and I could feel my little fin</i>
<i>flopping.</i>

755
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,300
<i>I felt very fishy.</i>

756
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,533
- Now, that's a catch.

757
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,233
- But still very "koi."

758
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,433
[laughter]

759
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:37,567
Detox.

760
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,333
Ooh, she's a power pouf girl.

761
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,567
- Or a cupcake.

762
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:43,066
-<i> I'm serving killer jellyfish</i>
<i>realness,</i>

763
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,467
<i>and I'm living for it.</i>

764
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,633
- You know,
you could shoplift in that.

765
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,600
She could steal a ham.

766
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,700
- Jade Jolie.

767
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,734
Chain, chain, chain!

768
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,834
-<i> I'm serving up some bondage</i>
<i>bombshell fish fierceness,</i>

769
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,533
<i>and I am loving it.</i>

770
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:00,633
- She spent a lot at Home Depot
for that one.

771
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,800
- Yes.
- [laughs]

772
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,533
- Roxxxy Andrews.

773
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,834
It's like a blazer
and no trousers.

774
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,233
- Blazer!

775
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,633
-<i> Miss Thang, I am walking down</i>

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,066
<i>Pose, pose, pose.</i>

778
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,867
- Roxxxy, your pussy is on fire.

779
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,633
- [laughs]

780
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:24,100
- Jinkx Monsoon,
chicken of the sea.

781
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,467
-<i> I am serving up Seattle boho</i>
<i>chic</i>

782
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,633
<i>with a flair of day out</i>
<i>at the beach.</i>

00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:30,600
[giggles]

784
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,300
- She's like a flying fish.

785
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,100
- Brackish, actually.

786
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,767
- Now there are 102 ways
to wear a scarf.

787
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,867
[laughter]

788
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,166
Ooh, Coco, girl.

789
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,934
- All right, little Coco Minaj.

00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:45,934
-<i> I am turning it out.</i>

791

<i>This is my runway.</i>

792

<i>Thank you, Ru, for letting me</i>
<i>borrow it.</i>

793
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,133
- Those boots are made
for stomping.

794
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,400
- Or wading through a river.

795
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,667
[laughter]

796
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,600
- Alyssa Edwards.

<i>Always and forever,</i>

800
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,834
<i>Alyssa Edwards.</i>

801
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,200
- Mm.
- What's her net worth?

802
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,233
- [laughs]

803
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,033
She has a date with Moby Dick.

804
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,600
- Lucky.

805
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,200
- Lineysha Sparx.

806
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,834
- That is Sheila E. realness.

807
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:19,533
- If a girl answers,
don't hang up.

808
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,967
-<i> I am serving bawdy,</i>
<i>bawdy, bawdy,</i>

809
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,500
<i>and just a little bit of bitch.</i>

810
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,300
- You know, she's got a leg up
on the competition.

811
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,467
- She does.

812
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:31,834
- The 49th state, Alaska.

813
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,533
- Something smells fishy.

814
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,767
-<i> I'm holding a brook trout</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>

815
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,266
<i>caught in Lake Erie.</i>

816
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:42,233
<i>Grandpa would be so proud</i>
<i>and completely horrified.</i>

817
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,433
- Would you like a mint?

818
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,266
- That outfit would go great
with some tartar sauce.

819
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,767
- Mmm.

820
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:49,834
-<i> Coming up...</i>

821
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,700
- It's rather pedestrian.

822
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,600
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.

823
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,633
- [laughs]

824
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:01,300
[laughs]

825
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,066
Welcome, ladies.

826
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:06,066
Based on your performances in
The Snatch Game

827
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,667
and your presentation
on the main stage,

828
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,800
I've made some decisions.

829
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,066
Jade Jolie...

830
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:16,066
Coco Montrese...

831
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,934
Alyssa Edwards...

832
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:24,834
Alyssa, this week you let down
Katy Perry.

833
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:29,667
I want you to tweet an apology
to her tonight--

834
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,233
#RuPaulogy.

835
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,567
- Yes, ma'am.

836
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:38,533
- But last week you won immunity
from elimination.

837
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,200
The three of you are safe.

838
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,433
- Katy Perry's fans
are gonna slay me.

839
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,767
It was an embarrassment
to my career.

840
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:56,100
- Ladies, survey says you

841
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,734
represent the best and the worst
of the week.

842
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,767
It's time for the judges'
critiques.

843
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,800
First up, Detox.

844
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,734
- The problem is, Ke$ha's not
really that much fun.

845
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:13,066
It has to be somebody
who's kind of fun.

846
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,900
I just don't want to hang
with Ke$ha.

847
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,734
- Tonight on the runway,
your side silhouette is huge...

848
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:20,633
like a ball with legs.

849
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:21,867
- The first thing I thought of

850
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:25,233
when I heard fishy fierceness
was a jellyfish.

851
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,667
- Really? That's the first thing
you thought of?

852
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,700
You're fiercer than that.

853
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
- Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.

854
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,367
- I thought you did
a wonderful job

855
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,367
with your portrayal of Tamar.

856
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:38,400
I had a lot of fun and giggles
with you.

857
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,533
- Tonight your boobs
look amazing.

858
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,066
I love a bedazzled muffin.

859
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,667
- The hair is interesting, but

860
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,433
I wish it was a little more
coiffed.

861
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,400
- Next up, the 49th state,
Alaska.

862
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

863
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,767
- Hi.

864
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:56,400
- Your Lady Bunny, for me,
was absolutely hilarious.

865
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,667
You have incredible timing.

866
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,133
Absolutely fantastic.

867
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,133
- One thing that was kind of

868
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:02,567
missing from Bunny
was her voice.

869
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,834
She--it sounded more...

870
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,934
[deep, raspy voice] Like Roz,
you know, than it did--

871
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,500
[high-pitched voice]
Bunny's up here.

872
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,100
[high-pitched cackle]

873
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,667
- Next up, Ivy Winters.

874
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:13,967
- Your dress tonight I loved.

875
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,934
I mean, I loved the fun
and camp value

876
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:17,800
that we got with Nemo
eating you.

877
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,066
- [laughs]

878
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:23,166
- But with Marilyn Monroe,
you lost an icon.

879
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,533
What is the first thing
you think about?

880
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,600
[breathily]
You think about that.

881
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,633
[normal voice] You know...

882
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,900
- I think doing Marilyn Monroe
is next to impossible.

883
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,467
Everybody's done it.

884
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:38,233
You have to find something that
we haven't seen done to death,

885
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,100
in a way.

886
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.

887
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,667
- You look absolutely stunning
tonight.

888
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,166
Love the hair and the choker and

889
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,600
the glam rock with the chains
going down.

890
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,667
- Celia Cruz was really generic.

891
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,233
- It's very hard make comedy
in other language.

892
00:33:57,233 --> 00:34:00,533
It's more comfortable for me
make somebody Latino.

893
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:01,800
- I think you have the skills,

894
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,200
but you just didn't pull it out
of that character.

895
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,467
- All right, next up,
Jinkx Monsoon.

896
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,133
Michelle Visage?

897
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,567
- Jinkxy, I am starting to give
up here.

898
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:15,433
It's rather pedestrian.

899
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,300
I'm not getting glamour.

900
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,200
- To me, this looks glamorous.

901
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,633
I have big blonde hair--

902
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,333
- This, to me,
is not big blonde hair.

903
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,600
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.

904
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,367
[laughter]

905
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,100
- We do?

906
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
- You ruled The Snatch Game.

907
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,200
- [giggles]

908
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,533
- I thought it was absolutely
brilliant,

909
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,967
and I think anybody

910
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:37,233
who ever does The Snatch Game
should watch what you did.

911
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,433
- Thank you, Jinkx.

912
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,300
Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

913
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,767
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

914
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,066
the judges
and I will deliberate.

915
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,066
[engine turning]

916
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,667
All right, kids,
just between us girls...

917
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:52,667
what do you think?

918
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,600
Let's start with Detox.

919
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,667
- She looks like a blob,
and I was not happy tonight.

920
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,800
- I disagree.

921
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,433
I thought it was quite
a nice jellyfish.

922
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,066
- To me, it looked like two
giant shower caps--

923
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,467
not hot in any way.

924
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,300
- Did she make you laugh--
Detox?

925
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,667
- It just came off
as annoying skank.

926
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,500
- Roxxxy Andrews...

927
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,600
- Roxxxy nailed that modern take
on Liza with a "Z."

928
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,567
- As Tamar, Roxxxy rocked it.

929
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,300
- [laughs]
- [snaps fingers] Okay?

930
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,266
- Let's go way up north
to Alaska.

931
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,300
Santino, I thought that Alaska's

932
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,700
jokes were crude, rude,
offensive.

933
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,066
She nailed Bunny completely.

934
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,734
- Right on the head.

935
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,300
Yes, the voice was not there,

936
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,500
but she was consistent with her
own made-up voice for Bunny.

937
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,166
- I actually liked her little
fish wiggle on the runway, and,

938
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:46,066
uh, she's got the tiniest butt
I've ever seen.

939
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:48,133
- Ivy Winters.

940
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:49,233
- With someone like Marilyn
Monroe,

941
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,600
you really have to have
the voice down.

942
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,266
- I just don't know
why you'd pick Marilyn.

943
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,567
It seems crazy to me
that you'd pick it

944
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,166
if you can't do the voice
or the character.

945
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,567
- Lineysha Sparx.

946
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:00,900
- She's a sex shooter.

947
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,133
She's getting phone calls from
Prince right now

948
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,800
to get in his new girl group.

949
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
- Or get his outfit back.

950
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,967
- [laughing] Yeah.

951
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,667
But her Snatch Game was lost
in translation.

952
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,700
- It actually reminded me of my
grandma at Christmas with too

953
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,066
much eggnog with a karaoke mic.

954
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,200
- Jinkx Monsoon.

955
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,767
- She was like the Meryl Streep
of drag queens.

956
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,367
- 'Cause that bitch turned it
out.

957
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:22,667
- Completely committed.

958
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,667
Should be committed.

959
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,166
- [laughs]

960
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,133
- I was just wondering if we'll
ever be able to get to see that

961
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:32,533
ultra-glamazon thing
from Jinkx once.

962
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,066
Not that this is ugly.

963
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,133
She's adorable.

964
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,834
- Who Jinkx reminds me
of is Pandora Boxx.

965
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,200
- Yeah.
- I actually like that dress.

966
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,934
It was just the way
it was styled,

967
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,066
the way she paired the things,

968
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:44,600
and these are things you can
learn.

969
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,066
- She thought that was big hair.

970
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,066
[laughter]

971
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,567
- [claps]
Silence.

972
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,700
I've made my decision.

973
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,166
Bring back...

974
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,400
[sighs]

975
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,233
[whispering] My girls.

976
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:57,233
[laughs]

977
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:02,066
[laughs]

978
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,433
Welcome back, ladies.

979
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,500
I've made some decisions.

980
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,633
Roxxxy Andrews...

981
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:10,667
you're safe.

982
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:14,367
- Thank you.

983
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,200
- Jinkx Monsoon...

984
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,100
you gave us 50 shades
of<i> Grey Gardens.</i>

985
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,900
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

986
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,333
[applause]

987
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:30,533
You've won a custom jewel
package from Fierce Drag Jewels.

988
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,834
- I won Snatch Game!

989
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,066
A life dream is coming true
today.

990
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,867
- Alaska...

991
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:38,900
you're safe.

992
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,333
- Thank you.

993
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,700
- Lineysha Sparx,

994
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,834
as the queen of salsa,

995
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:50,333
you lacked spice.

996
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,767
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

997
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:58,767
- To be in the bottom two
is very hard for myself.

998
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:01,567
But I don't want to go home.

999
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,834
- Ivy Winters,

1000
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,667
your Marilyn Monroe was

1001
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,867
one bland bombshell.

1002
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,800
Detox, your Ke$ha was,
in a word...

1003
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,333
blah, blah, blah.

1004
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,900
Detox...

1005
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,533
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1006
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:31,166
Ivy Winters, you are safe.

1007
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,200
- Thank you.

1008
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,100
- You may join the other girls.

1009
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,533
Two queens stand before me.

1010
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,900
Ladies, this is your last chance

1011
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,166
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.

1012
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:49,400
The time has come...

1013
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,433
for you to lip-synch

1014
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,967
for your life.

1015
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,367
- I'm really well-known for
my unique style of lip-synch.

1016
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm ready to send
Lineysha packing.

1017
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,100
- Good luck...

1018
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,333

00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,667
shantay, you stay.

1060
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,367
You may join the other girls.

1061
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:01,133
Lineysha, your beauty transcends
language,

1062
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:06,066
and there's no barrier
to how far you will soar.

1063
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:10,066
Now sashay away.

1064
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:11,767
[applause]

1065
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:13,834
- [smooching]

1066
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,066
- I love you,<i> mami.</i>

1067
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:18,867
- This is the end for me
in this competition,

1068
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:23,767
but I feel very proud to be one
of the family of<i> Drag Race.</i>

1069
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:28,600
[speaking Spanish]

1070
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,967
- Condragulations,
my crazy eight.

1071
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:34,734
And remember, if you can't
love yourself,

1072
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:36,734
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

1073
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,600
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1074
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,633
all: Amen.

1075
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:41,700
- All right, let the music play.

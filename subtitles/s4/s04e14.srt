00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,934
- That's a desperate
cry for attention.

184
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:26,934
- A little<i> I am what I am,</i>

188
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,200
- Milan, girl,
that's clearly a dude.

189
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,900
[cheers and applause]

190
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,633
- London, Paris, Milan.

191
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,867
You look great.

192
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,166
Now, have you done something

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,467
different with your hair?

194
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,834
Oh, no--oh, you're wearing it.

195
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,066
[laughter]

196
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,800
Now, I gotta ask,
I gotta ask,

197
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,567
now, were you surprised
by the uproar

198
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,066
over all the hair flipping?

199
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,066
- You know, to be honest,

200
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,567
I was a bit surprised.

201
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,166
I, um--I think that people
sometimes misinterpret

202
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,066
what I do as an artist.

203
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,166
At times you'll disagree,

204
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,433
and I respect that.

205
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,133
- So do you feel like
flipping your wig right now?

206
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,166
Let's do it together.

207
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,800
You first.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,767
Ready?

209
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,100
Come on, come on, let's do it.

210
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,834
Come on, Milan.

211
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:11,734
Come on.

212
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:13,233
- For real?
- No!

213
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,367
- For real?

214
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,500
- No, thank you, Milan.

215
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,800
- Thank you, guys.

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,700
- Next up, when it came time
to put an outfit together,

217
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,433
this queen got Jiggly with it.

218
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,066
Let's take a look.

219
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,600
- The thing is,
I don't need to sew

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,467
to become
the next drag superstar.

221
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,600
- I don't see a real dress.

222
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,033
- I'm finishing that up
with some more...

223
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,667
garbage.

224
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,000
- Baked potato couture.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,467
- Girl, right now you're a mess.

226
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,433
Things are falling off.

227
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,433
Fix your tutu.

228
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,266
- Where the fuck are my tits?

229
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,767
- It ain't the school for drag.

230
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,767
Let's face it,
she just took a bunch of pom-pom

231
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,000
and she just threw it on top.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
It just looks horrible.

233
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,467
It looks horrible.

234
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,133
- Beyoncé don't be sewing
her shit.

235
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:56,667
[laughter]

236
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,467
- Hello, Jiggly Caliente.

237
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,433
May I call you Jiggly?

238
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,800
- Of course, darling.

239
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Everybody does.

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,834
- [laughs]

241
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,066
Now--now listen.

242
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,500
Now, your struggles with sewing

243
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,166
and design brought you down.

244
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,834
Have you been working on this?

245
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,367
- My brother gave me a gift.

246
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,734
Like, after his tax return check
came,

247
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:20,633
he decided--he decided to get me
sewing lessons.

248
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,467
So in a couple weeks I'm gonna
start my sewing classes,

249
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,166
and then I'm gonna turn it
the fuck out.

250
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,633
[laughter and applause]

251
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:30,834
- All right, so all right.

252
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,066
Let's talk about
your temper tantrums.

253
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,600
- I mean,
like I said on the show,

254
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,066
I kept it 100 all day every day.

255
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,066
- You kept it 100?

256
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,500
- All day--
- Not 95?

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,266
- Not 95.
100 all day every day.

258
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,934
And some people
just didn't like it.

259
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:46,400
And sometimes they took
my temper or my anger,

260
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
and there was just
so many issues I had

261
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,667
also coming onto the show.

262
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,300
When I got home,
I went to go get--

263
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,200
went to go see therapy.

264
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,333
I have serious daddy issues
and--

265
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,333
- Honey, don't we all?
Right?

266
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,867
- Well--
[laughter]

267
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:04,567
- Um, so the therapist told me
to write a letter, and I did.

268
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,767
- You wrote a letter to daddy?

269
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,166
- Yeah, I did.

270
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,500
But she didn't tell me that,
you know, to really mail it.

271
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,233
I mailed it,
and the right address.

272
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,533
So whoever gets it--

273
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,667
- Well, actually, I have
the letter right here, Jiggly.

274
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,834
- Oh, shit!
- No.

275
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:17,834
[laughter]

276
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,533
[cheers and applause]

277
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,567
- All right, next up Dida Ritz.

278
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,367
Dida, during your time
on<i> Drag Race,</i>

279
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,934
you had a breakthrough
with your family.

280
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:31,633
Let's take a look.

281
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,066
- Surprise, Dida.

282
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,233
- [gasps]

283
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,433
- It's your mom.

284
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,800
- That's my mommy.

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,934
- Say hi, dad.

286
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,066
- Hi.

287
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,367
- We just wanted to let you know

288
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,934
how much we love you
and we miss you.

289
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:46,467
And we're really proud of you
for pursuing your dreams.

290
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,567
Love you!

291
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,600
See you soon.

292
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,667
Bye-bye.

293
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,867
- So, Dida, what's happened
since the show?

294
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,433
- Since the show, you know,

295
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,834
before my parents
never saw me in drag,

296
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,600
they'd never been to a show,

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,266
and now they watch the show.

298
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,667
My family is, like,
the biggest fans.

299
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,300
My mom calls me so much,

300
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,333
and she's always telling me

301
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,934
how my grandparents
watch the show

302
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,433
every time it comes on reruns.

303
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,967
And my mom's actually here.

304
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,333
- Is she here?
Your mother's here?

305
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,834
Oh, there--

306
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,066
may I call you Mama Ritz?

307
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,300
- Yes, you may.

308
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,767
- Now, in the clip we heard

309
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,266
your husband in the background.

310
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,500
What does he think about Dida
on television in drag?

311
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,667
- He's proud of him.

312
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,333
- Really?
- Mm-hmm, and he loves him.

313
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,500
- How does it feel
to get this acceptance

314
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,367
from your father
and your mother?

315
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,367
- It feels amazing.

316
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,433
You know,
every time I've seen you

317
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,633
I've said thank you
a million times

318
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,300
because you're bringing
happy homes together

319
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,500
and especially religious homes
together.

320
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,800
So I guess for me
it's a blessing,

321
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,633
and it's something
I feel very happy to have

322
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,066
because I know that there
are people out there

323
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,433
who don't have that, you know?

324
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,100
My mom's sitting here right now,
so...

325
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
- Yeah, yeah.

326
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
[cheers and applause]

327
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,533
Your parents are proud of you,

328
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,900
and so am I.

329
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,867
And like I always say,

330
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,667
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>

331
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,166
Bringing families together.

332
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,133
[laughter]

333
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,200
It's true.

334
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,367
Up next, little Kenya Michaels.

335
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,633
She had the looks, the moves,

336
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,066
but what the hell
was she talking about?

337
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,066
[laughter]

338
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,967
I mean, let's take a look.

339
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,367
[laughter]

340
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:18,467
- Mama, it's not what you say.

341
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,066
It's what you do.

342
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,066
[roars]

343
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,266
Hmm, I kind of
like the smell!

344
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,900
- Kenya, you like the smell
of the beaver,

345
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,567
so don't hold your nose.

346
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,867
- This is a challenge
that you can go and kick ass,

347
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,767
because go, girl, smoke that.

348
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,066
That's my time, you know?

349
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,800
And it's more easy for you
than for me

350
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
that I don't speak more English.

351
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,600
It's the only thing that I say.

352
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,734
That's all.

353
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,066
- I understood
about four words of that.

354
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,166
- Whoo!

355
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,734
[cheers and applause]

356
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,600
- Hello, little Kenya.

357
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,934
Hello.

358
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,266
Now, my dear, sometimes it was
difficult to understand...

359
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,500
- I know.

360
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,667
- But tonight
we don't want to miss a thing.

361
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,467
So we've invited
an extra special translator.

362
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:07,834
Please welcome our biggest
drag professor, Charo.

363
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:11,900
[cheers and applause]

364
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,333
- Hola.

365
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,400
- Hola.

366
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:29,166
- Hello, Charo.

367
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,567
Now, Charo,
I need you to ask Kenya

368
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,734
how has everyone in Puerto Rico
responded

369
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,900
to her appearance on our show.

370
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,200
[laughter]
- Right.

371
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,900
- Yes.
- Yeah.

372
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,600
- [speaking Spanish]

373
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,633
[both speaking Spanish]

374
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,567
- Si?
- Ah, yeah.

375
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,633
- [speaking Spanish]

376
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:14,066
[cheers and applause]

377
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,567
[continues speaking Spanish]

378
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,100
[both speaking Spanish]

379
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,567
- Si, si.
- [continues speaking Spanish]

380
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,500
- Si, si.

381
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,333
Um...
[laughter]

382
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,500
Well, I tell you what, Charo.

383
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,734
Let's ask her one more question.

384
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,567
Please ask her
if she was surprised

385
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,734
that we brought her back
to the show.

386
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,600
- Right.

387
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,667
[speaking Spanish]

388
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:54,600
- Jodera...

389
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,300
[speaking Spanish]

390
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,133
I'm so excited, girl.

391
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,100
[speaking Spanish]

392
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,533
Baby, it's not what you say.

393
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,333
It's what you do.

394
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,934
[cheers and applause]

395
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,800
- Right, I kinda understood

396
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,367
the last part, but could you--

397
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,867
could you translate the first
part of that, Charo?

398
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,333
What'd she say?

399
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,600
- RuPaul, I'm very confused.

400
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,533
I cannot understand
a word that bitch say.

401
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,900
[laughter]

402
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,734
[cheers and applause]

403
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:32,734
- Well, Kenya,
you are a fierce queen

404
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,066
in any language.

405
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,100
And, professor Charo,
so are you.

406
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
[cheers and applause]

407
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,667
Kenya, do you cuchi-cuchi?

408
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,066
- No, can you show me, please?

409
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,133
- [speaking Spanish]

410
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:46,300
- Actually, let's everybody

411
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,834
cuchi-cuchi out to commercial.

412
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,066
[upbeat music]

413
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:53,266
[cheers and applause]

414
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,567
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>

415
00:17:56,567 --> 00:18:00,200
Now, before we crown
America's next drag superstar,

416
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,166
there's an important
piece of business

417
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,367
that we need to attend to.

418
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,967
This season, for the first time
in Drag Race history,

419
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:11,266
a queen was disqualified
from the competition.

420
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,066
Now, rumors have been flying,

421
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,433
but there's one thing
for certain.

422
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:18,700
There's never been
a more controversial queen.

423
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,300
Let's take a look.

424
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,333
Willam,
it has come to my attention

425
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,266
that you have broken the rules.

426
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,834
Willam, I have to ask you

427
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:34,734
to leave the competition
immediately.

428
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:39,667
[cheers and applause]

429
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

430
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,467
to set the record straight
about Willam...

431
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,767
you'll have to tune in
to this season's premiere

432
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,900
of<i> RuPaul's Drag U,</i>
coming this summer on Logo.

433
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,400
[audience groans]

434
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,567
Just kidding.

435
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,266
J.K., Miss Thing.

436
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,300
[laughter]

437
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,867
Please welcome back Willam.

438
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,066
[cheers and applause]

439
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,266
Now, Willam, I want the answer

440
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,734
to the question
everyone is dying to know.

441
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,600
Audience, let's say it together.

442
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,700
all: What did Willam do?

443
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,500
What did Willam do?

444
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,233
What did Willam do?

445
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,133
- What didn't I do?

446
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,400
[laughter]

447
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,567
- No, seriously,

448
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,266
I want you to take a deep breath

449
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,600
and break it down for me, okay?

450
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,100
- When you go away to<i> Drag Race,</i>

451
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,900
you can't tell anybody.

452
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,867
It's top secret.

453
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,600
And I told my husband
I was doing

454
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,066
a non-union horror movie
in Europe,

455
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,600
which I've done before,
and they suck,

456
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,133
so don't watch them.

457
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,400
And he didn't believe me.

458
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,133
He's like, "Why you gotta
take all this drag?"

459
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,867
So I lied, and he followed me
to the hotel.

460
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,066
And then the first night

461
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:04,500
he knocked on my door,
and it was a delivery.

462
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,300
- So in other words,
you were receiving

463
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,133
conjugal visits
from your husband,

464
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,834
and unfortunately

465
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,633
that was a violation
of the rules.

466
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,066
- Visiting makes it sound like
we were visiting.

467
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,367
There wasn't no talking.

468
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:18,033
- [laughs]

469
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,567
- But they were
very long visits.

470
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,667
He's 6'6".

471
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,934
- Oh, yes, yes.

472
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,900
Listen, I was disappointed
to see you go

473
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,433
and so were your fans.

474
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:28,467
[cheering]

475
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,400
- Thank you.

476
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,066
- I want you to know that

477
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,200
I really, really believe in you.

478
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
And actually I thought you had

479
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,100
a chance to go all the way.

480
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,367
[cheers and applause]

481
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,467
Do you have any regrets?

482
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,867
- Um...

483
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,600
I was gonna be flippant,

484
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,767
but after hearing you say that,

485
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,900
um...I regret that...

486
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
I maybe--

487
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,166
I should win next time.

488
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,834
- [laughs]

489
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,066
- Well, Willam, I have one
last question to ask.

490
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,066
- Sure.

491
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,333
- And this is
a serious question.

492
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,367
- All right.

493
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,767
- Do you have anything to plug?

494
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,100
- I have my new single,

495
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,967
the<i> WDWD Doot-Doot Trouble</i><span style="bodyStyle"> mix</i>

496
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,433
on iTunes.

497
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,533
And here's a little sticker.

498
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,633
- Oh, great, thank you.

499
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,266
- Yeah, and they're scented too.

500
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,700
They smell like a sticker.

501
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,800
- Oh, yeah, they do.

502
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,066
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:25,433
Willam, I expect great things
from you in the future,

504
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:26,900
so keep breaking the rules,
mama.

505
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,533
Just don't break my rules, okay?

506
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,900
- No, your show, your rules.

507
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,333
- That's right.

508
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,467
This next queen won our hearts
and made us cry

509
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:37,166
and redefined
the meaning of the word "bitch,"

510
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,900
being in total control
of herself.

511
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,066
I'm talking about
Latrice motherfucking Royale.

512
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,333
Let's take a look.

513
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,200
[cheers and applause]

514
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,800
- You have changed my life
forever.

515
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,200
You have changed the world
of drag forever.

516
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,066
Thank you for seeing
something special in me.

517
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,233
Thank you.

518
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,533
[cheers and applause]

519
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,667
- [laughs]

520
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,900
Now, I wanna ask you, Latrice,

521
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,333
how has<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
changed your life?

522
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,166
- I am not the same.

523
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:19,166
I mean, the overwhelming
response that I'm getting,

524
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,233
the outpour of love
that I'm getting,

525
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:24,934
I never expected
to get all this.

526
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,400
I mean, really.

527
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,467
But I truly am humbled by it.

528
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,100
I thank you so much.

529
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,166
I definitely feel that, um,

530
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,233
I'm inspired
to keep on keeping on

531
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,667
because doing me works.

532
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:44,567
[cheers and applause]

533
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:50,066
- Now, you were very open
about your prison background.

534
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:53,166
Do you regret letting the world
know about that?

535
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,533
- No, that was the most

536
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:57,133
liberating thing
that I ever coulda done.

537
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:59,533
I want people to realize that

538
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,800
it's okay to make mistakes.

539
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,533
It's okay to fall down.

540
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:09,266
Get up, look sickening,
and make them eat it.

541
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:12,333
[cheers and applause]

542
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,066
- I hear that you brought

543
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,300
a letter from a fan.

544
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,467
- I did.

545
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,066
I did it just so--

546
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,066
if it's not all wet.

547
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,100
- Oh.

548
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,066
- Moist.

549
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,834
- Ew, dear.

550
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:30,834
- Delicious.

551
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:33,433
- Oh, okay.

552
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,800
- Says, "Hi, Latrice.

553
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,333
"I just wanted to tell you
what a role model you have been

554
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,400
"for my ten-year-old daughter
Katherine.

555
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,467
"We get in bed
every Monday night together

556
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,500
"and watch the Drag Race.

557
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,233
"She's been dealing with
some bullying issues,

558
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:49,066
"but lately she's been
channeling her inner Latrice

559
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:53,066
and showing those bitches
the door."

560
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,667

561
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,300

in the morning,

"I tell her,
'You be fierce, mama.'

563
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,767

Rock on.

564
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:03,800

565
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,900
- That is lovely.

566
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
I love it.

567
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,066

seen the last of Latrice.

568
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,500

Ha, it's fabulous.

576
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,066

579
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,533
Last week, our top three queens

580
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,300
were lip syncing for their lives

581
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,166

Tonight they're dying
to find out

585
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:58,367
who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.

586
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,967
Please welcome back to the stage
the top three.

587
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,300
[cheers and applause]

588
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:35,300
My girls, my girls.

589
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,834
Can you feel the love tonight?

590
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,133
- Oh, it's incredible.
- Fabulous.

591
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,934
- It's "phierce" with a "p-h".
- Yes.

592
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:45,066
- Sharon, Phi Phi,
for most of the season

593
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:47,967
the two of you hated each other.

594
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,867
Why?

595
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,233
- Well, who first?

596
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,100
- It's really hard
for me to hate someone,

597
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,367
and it's really easy for me

598
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,533
just to get along with anyone

599
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:59,500
when I can just find
a redeeming quality.

600
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,333
Unfortunately,
it was really hard for me

601
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:05,133
to find a redeeming quality.

602
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,367
I mean, that's--

603
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,967
[cheers and applause]

604
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,700
- And Phi Phi, uh, why did you
hate Sharon so much?

605
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
- I did feel that a lot of times

606
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,934
instead of talking to me
as a person,

607
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,633
she was talking down to me
or at me,

608
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:21,400
and I don't take that very well.

609
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,834
But, I mean, I love her and

610
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,367
I respect what she does and--

611
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,700
- Bullshit.

612
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,934
[cheers and applause]

613
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,500
- Now, Chad,
you defended Phi Phi

614
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,266
for most of the season.

615
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,266
- I did.

616
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,066
- How do you feel about her now?

617
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,633
- As I watched the season
from home,

618
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:51,300
I realized that there were times

619
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,133
when I wasn't around that

620
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,467
Phi Phi really
let her ass hang out,

621
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:58,900
and, um, a lot happened
when I wasn't there.

622
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,767
And I literally felt like I was

623
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,300
walking around in a cloud.

624
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,567
Specifically setting up
Jiggly to fail.

625
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,834
Um, well, trying to set up
Willam to go home

626
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:13,266
by having Latrice
throw the contest.

627
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,600
And then the thing that just
left me really unsettled,

628
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,066
Phi Phi, in the Gold Bar,
when you came for Willam

629
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:21,700
it wasn't an attack
on his talent,

630
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,500
and it wasn't an attack on
what he was doing at the show.

631
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,533
It was a personal attack.

632
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:29,066
And I just--
I just felt as though

633
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,300
you could have behaved
a little bit better.

634
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,800
But that's my opinion, baby.

635
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,633
- And I complete--
I completely understand

636
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,734
where you're coming from,
and I do--

637
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:38,100
I watch the show now
and I see that--

638
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,367
watching, I'm like,
oh, I'm insane.

639
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,133
[laughter]

640
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:46,533
And, um, I just felt sometimes

641
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:47,734
that you guys were attacking me,

642
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,066
and so maybe that was
my defense mechanism.

643
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,233
- I wanna hear from
some of the other queens.

644
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:56,767
Do you have anything to say
to any of our top three queens?

645
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,100
Jiggly?

646
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,900
- This hurts a lot.

647
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,367
Phi Phi, me and you,

648
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:06,700
we supposed to be road dogs.

649
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,500
We supposed to be sisters.

650
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,900
You came to my crib.

651
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,867
You chilled with me.

652
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:15,333
And for me to see that
like that at--

653
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:20,066
damn, girl, I swear to god.

654
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,867
Ooh, I just felt betrayed.

655
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,333
And you always were like,

656
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,133
"You can lean on me
and you can lean on me,"

657
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,700
and then that.

658
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,867
I felt like a sucker.

659
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:34,200
And I'm supposed to be
your sister?

660
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,500
That shit ain't cool with me.

661
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,066
- You know,
I completely apologize

662
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,533
if that hurt you in any way,

663
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,066
but when I signed on
to this show--

664
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,233
and people might not
agree to it--

665
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:47,367
I signed in to win $100,000
and a crown.

666
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,633
- Honestly, like, I think--

667
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:50,800
I'm an egomaniac.

668
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,100
Everybody knows that.

669
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,066
But, like, she should be studied
down there.

670
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,266
I don't understand it.

671
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,100
It's almost sociopathic the way

672
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,600
she'll tell people, um,

673
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,700
"It was just a character.

674
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
I was just playing it up."

675
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
And then she'll sign autographs,

676
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,934
"Fuck Willam, fuck Sharon."

677
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:05,066
It's not cool.

678
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,500
And I understand
that it's a game.

679
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
I never retaliated on the show
because I didn't care

680
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,333
and indifference
is worse than hate.

681
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,667
And I'm not gonna "RuPaulogize"

682
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,333
for anything that I'm doing now.

00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,567
I'm galvanized, I'm focused,

722
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,834
and I'm ready to
take home the crown tonight.

723
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,667
[cheers and applause]

724
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,333
- Now, do you have
someone special

725
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,867
here tonight rooting for you?

726
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:26,867
- You know I do.

727
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,700
I have my partner, Adam Magee.

728
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,734
He's right over here.

729
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,066
- Hi.

730
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:35,133
[cheers and applause]

731
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,133
- So, Adam.

732
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,166
- Yes?

733
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,133
- Now, you design out--

734
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,500
did you design this outfit?

735
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,834
- From head to toe, sweetheart.

736
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,333
- Really?

737
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,633
[cheers and applause]

738
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:49,867
Gorgeous.

739
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,233
I'll have one in every color.

740
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:54,834
[laughter]

741
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,867
Now, Chad, I want to ask you:

742
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,667
What would it mean for you

743
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:02,800
to become America's
next drag superstar?

744
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,066
- It would be a personal test

745
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:09,333
that I put on myself
that I passed.

746
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:15,066
It would be showing me
what I'm made of.

747
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,600
It would be justifying
all the support that I have had

748
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,834
over the last 20 years of--

749
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,066
basically I get to
play dress up for a living

750
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,500
and walk around the stage
and move my lips.

751
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,400
I think lastly, Ru, for me

752
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,934
and for so many entertainers
across the country

753
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,300
it would be my honor
and my privilege

754
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,467
to represent<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

755
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,500
and to work for you, mama.

756
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,333
[cheers and applause]

757
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,767
- Chad Michaels,
I want to thank you

758
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:48,734
for elevating this
beautiful race to the highest.

759
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,066
You are a class act.

760
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:50,967
- Thank you, Ru.

761
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,967
Thank you, thank you.

762
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:58,333
[cheers and applause]

763
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,200
- All right, up next,

764
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,667
Sharon Needles.

765
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,734
[cheers and applause]

766
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,867
Now, Sharon, you've become
quite the cult figure.

767
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,900
How does it feel?

768
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,533
- It's humbling
because, you know,

769
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,166
I came here, you know, to show,

770
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,533
you know, the underbelly

771
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:22,133
and the underground outsider
art side of drag

772
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,367
and try and get $100,000
doing it,

773
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:29,433
and now it's become
a full-time job

774
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,066
and a responsibility
to so many young people.

775
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,333
I get hundreds of letters
a week.

776
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,700
I never thought I would
touch people like that.

777
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,767
[cheers and applause]

778
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,700
- Now, you have
some special people

779
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,367
here tonight to cheer you on.

780
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:51,467
- I do.

781
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:54,333
I have my girlfriend
with a penis, Alaska.

782
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,433
[cheers and applause]

783
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,734
And I also have my
mommy dearest, Joan craw--

784
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,667
or excuse me,
Joan Coady right there.

785
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,900
[cheers and applause]

786
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,567
- Was he a spooky child?

787
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,266
- Well, he's always been a fan

788
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:15,066
of horror movies
and Halloween in general.

789
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:16,567
In our house, Halloween costumes

790
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:17,700
didn't come out of a box.

791
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,934
And the last unspooky costume

792
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,533
I remember was the scarecrow

793
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,734
from<i> The Wizard of Oz.</i>

794
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:24,967
So from then on it's just been

795
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:27,166
zombies and bloody things.

796
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,233
- [laughs]

797
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,734
What would it mean for you

798
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:39,200
to be America's
next drag superstar?

799
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,333
- Well, first it would be
such a great honor.

800
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,066
Being the holder of the crown

801
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:46,433
would show that you don't
have to fit a certain mold

802
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:48,066
to make it in any industry

803
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,600
or in any desire that you want.

804
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,667
And for any gay kid out there

805
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,600
or just weird kid
that gets picked on,

806
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,400
just know, you know,
when in doubt, freak them out.

807
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,467
Do whatever the fuck
you wanna do, and--

808
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:06,767
[cheers and applause]

809
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,700
And if anyone
ever boos you offstage,

810
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,967
that is simply
applause from ghosts.

811
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:12,734
You remember that.

812
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:15,066
- [laughs]

813
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:18,266
[audience boos]

814
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:22,066
- I love it.

815
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:26,700
[cheers and applause]

816
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,300
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

817
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,133
[cheers and applause]

818
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:35,333
No one has been in it to win it
more than you have,

819
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:40,500
and that drive has propelled you
into the top three.

820
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,734
Now, what's the best thing
to come out of the experience?

821
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:44,633
- As many haters as I have,

822
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:46,734
I would definitely have to say
that the fans,

823
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,066
the fans that I do have,

824
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:51,500
because, granted I came in here
to win the $100,000,

825
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,400
a crown, title of
America's next drag superstar,

826
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,867
but I wanted to be the backbone
and strength

827
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,934
for a lot of those kids
that had to go through,

828
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,066
like, a child abuse past
and stuff like that

829
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,433
and just have that person
that they could look up to

830
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,066
that I didn't have as a child.

831
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,533
- Right,
now you've been very honest

832
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,667
about your relationship
with your father.

833
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,100
And have things improved
since the show aired?

834
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,133
- No.

835
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,233
- Does he know
you've done the show?

836
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,066
- Yeah.

837
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,533
Um...

838
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,700
I know he watches it, and, um,

839
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,066
and I know he doesn't like it.

840
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,066
But I love me.

841
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,066
And, um--

842
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:32,133
[cheers and applause]

843
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:42,266
If I can show any kids out there
to be strong

844
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:47,767
and, um, live life for yourself
and just be happy,

845
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:50,200
make sure that at the end of the
day when you go to bed,

846
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,433
as long as you love yourself

847
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,734
and you're proud
of everything that you did,

848
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:54,834
fuck what everybody else says.

849
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:57,567
[cheers and applause]

850
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:00,533
- So, Phi Phi, who's here
rooting for you tonight?

851
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:01,900
- The person
I look up to the most,

852
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,600
um, my beautiful mother.

853
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,400
[applause]

854
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,066
- And what's your mom's name?

855
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,066
- That's Rhonda.

856
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:12,066
- Hi, Rhonda.

857
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,266
What do you think of Phi Phi?

858
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:14,900
- I think he's beautiful.

859
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,533
I just think that the judges
made a call right

860
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,967
when they said he may of wore
a little bit too much makeup.

861
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,166
[laughter]

862
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,300
- Shut up.

863
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
- But he toned it down,
and he looks great.

864
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,834
He looks just like me.

865
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,367
[laughter]

866
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:33,567
[cheers and applause]

867
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,500
- Phi Phi,
what would it mean to you

868
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,300
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?

869
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,200
- Money in the bank.

870
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,567
[laughter]

871
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,667
And, um, like I said, a voice.

872
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,200
I just want to show people that

873
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,400
you can fight for anything that
you want,

874
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,467
and never let anybody stop you

875
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:54,834
because if you want it,

876
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:55,900
you can make it happen.

877
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,200
- Thank you, Phi Phi.

878
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,834
And I just want to say,

879
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:01,500
watching you
in this competition grow

880
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,867
and be such a fighter has just
really been amazing.

881
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,734
And no matter what anybody says,
you are fantastic,

882
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:11,400
and you deserve
to be in this race, okay?

883
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,266
Let's give
a big round of applause

884
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:14,900
for our top three.

885
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,800
[cheers and applause]

886
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,433
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited.</i>

887
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,300
Chad Michaels, Sharon Needles,

888
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,066
and Phi Phi O'Hara, one of you

889
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:30,166
is just moments away
from being crowned

890
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,567
America's next drag superstar.

891
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,066
Before I announce the winner,

892
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:37,834
I'd like to hear from our judges
one last time.

893
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,767
Michelle visage,
what do you think?

894
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,367
- I can tell you
from the bottom of my heart

895
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,834
any one of these queens
will represent you

896
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:49,100
and your show flawlessly.

897
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,233
- Thank you.

898
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,133
[cheers and applause]

899
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,533

The first headpiece is from
Milan and Latrice Royale.

- The basis of making
the headdress

158
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,867
is to make sure
that you can actually wear it.

159

that was gonna be

179
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,800
as big and as beautiful
as her spirit

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,467
and represent her as a whole.

181
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:01,433
- Love it.

182
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,400
So I will consult
with the client.

183
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,367
Tell me, dahling.

184
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,767
Okay. All right.

185
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:11,467
And the winner of this
mini-challenge is...

186
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,066
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly.

<i>like your first kiss</i>
<i>or your first time in drag.</i>

- Sharon Needles.

213
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,300
- Yes, ma'am, Phi Phi.

214
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
- I'm not dumb.

[snickers]

216
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,300

<i>Jiggly and Madame LaQueer.</i>

224

- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.

225
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,633
- [giggling]

226
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,767
-<i> Again I got picked last.</i>

227
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,200
I thought that Kenya was going
to go through for me.

228
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,934
- And that means Madame LaQueer
is Team<i> Glamazon.</i>

229
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,233
- Oh.

230
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,367
- Going up.

231
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,600
- I gave a hand.

232
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,734
She rejected it.

233
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:03,200
- [grunts]

234
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,567
-<i> So are the people</i>

<i>does not help each other?</i>

237
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,266
That's sad.
That is very sad.

238
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,767
- Ladies, my entire recording
career is in your hands.

239
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,433
Gentlemen, start your engines,

240
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,934

seller win.

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,500
- I want us each to have
a completely different look.

243
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
<i>I want to appeal to everybody.</i>

244
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,934
I want to be completely ghetto.

245
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,867
Can you do, like, gospel?
- Yeah.

246
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,567
- I could be very girly.
- Okay, you know what?

247
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:41,567
I'm gonna be honest with you.

248
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,600
You've done girly every time

249
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,967
that you've tried to do
something.

250
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,967
I don't want you to do girly.

251
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,500
Can you do, like, club kid?
- Yeah, I could do that.

252
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,767
- I'm kind of channeling, like,
my character being a housewife.

253
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,834
- I want you to look
very Stepford wife.

254
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:56,266
I want you as, like--
as gothic as can be.

255
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,967
I think you doing your
goth thing would be perfect.

256
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,333
-<i> As much as I love being</i>
<i>a horror character,</i>

257
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,367
as a drag queen, there is
a million looks inside me.

258
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,600
- Boom. Boom.

259
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,867
- Our challenge today
is to make a infomercial

260
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:17,000
to sell RuPaul's albums
<i>Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Champion.</i>

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,800
I have a killer pimple,
and I did not know this.

262
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,166
<i>So we had to make testimonials</i>

263
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,633
<i>depending on which song</i>
<i>we were assigned.</i>

264
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,100
<i>We had to have choreographed</i>
<i>dance, make costumes.</i>

265
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,467
Do you have any
plastic necklaces?

266
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,500
- Um, I have, like,
one turquoise one.

267
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,033
You want it?
-<i> Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

268
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,500
It has to be, like, darker.

269
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>Each team got assigned</i>
<i>a different album.</i>

270
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,166
<i>So we got</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion.</i>

271
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,367
Are you guys gonna start
getting ready or not?

272
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,400
- Well, do you want to start

273
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,033
doing choreography
and everything?

274
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,967
- Oh, yeah, we have to do
our choreography.

275
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,400
Fucking shit.

276
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,500
- Girl.

277
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,967
- It's only a little snippet.

278
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,033
- Have you listened to it?

279
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,467
- Oh.

280
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,333
-<i> It's every song off the album.</i>

281
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,066
-<i> Yeah.</i>

282
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:57,967
- An hour and a half
to do choreography,

283
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,867
plus do the costumes,
plus pick our pictures

284
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,166
and memorize this song
and do a dance?

285
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,367
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,934
- Ugh.

287
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,066
God!

288
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,700
- Get into it, girl.
Get into it.

289
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,800
- We can't do this.

290
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,133
We can't let this break us.
Come on.

291
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,066
-<i> Phi Phi is the team leader.</i>

292
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,633
<i>Definitely, there was a lot</i>
<i>of pressure.</i>

293
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:15,333
We say the captain goes down
with the ship.

294
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,734
-<i> Do y'all's face, like,</i>
<i>super fast,</i>

295
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,867
<i>so that way, we can rehearse</i>
<i>afterwards.</i>

296
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,300
- Can everybody be painted
in 30 minutes?

297
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,734
- In 30?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,700
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.

299
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,800
That's all we need you to do.

300
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,066
-<i> Phi Phi wants to call me goth</i>

301
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,834
and wants to push me
into one small box,

302
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,233
which is a box she knows
nothing about.

303
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,900
- [gasps]
Oh, Jiggly!

304
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,066
You should do<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and do a whole Asian theme.

305
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,133
<i>And then you can wear</i>
<i>my red bob.</i>

306
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,433
-<i> Okay.</i>

307
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,867
- So hurry up and get painted
and just look super Asian.

308
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,266
Oh, so don't put any makeup on.

309
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,700
-<i> Stupid.</i>

310
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,900
-<i> I just felt like I was</i>
<i>in the team of the busted.</i>

311
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,934
And I wanted to be
in the team of the dusted.

312
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,066
- Okay, so what we need to do
is come up with a theme.

313
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,900
- Maybe we try to put<i> Glamazon--</i>

314
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,333
our animals, our fears, costume
to that first and--

315
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,867
- Yeah, but because
of our time frame,

316
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,967
we got to make sure
that everybody

317
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,433
can get something
that's universal.

318
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,266
Let's just decide to go on '80s.

319
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:18,367
<i>I think we all knew that Kenya</i>
<i>had a language barrier.</i>

320
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:23,066
So I decided to take control of
that situation and help Kenya.

321
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,800
- We have to pick
our individual backgrounds

322
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,867
for our individual performance.

323
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,900
- Okay, great.
Can you find humor in that?

324
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,433
You know what I'm saying? Like--

325
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,400
- In clouds?
- Yeah.

326
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,667
- Kenya is supposed to be
the team leader,

327
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,166
but Milan is stepping in,
and I'm sorry.

328
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,367
I don't think
it's the language barrier.

329
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,967
- '80s is about this.

330
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,400
You know, it's about this.

331
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,834
It's about, "Ha, ha, ha."

332
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,567
- The first position
for the<i> Superstar.</i>

333
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,667
What is the first position?

334
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:46,700
- It's, um...

335
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,066
<i>♪ Gonna love you ♪</i>

336
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,066
<i>♪ As you are ♪</i>

337
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,266
- And next--next--

338
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,233
- Let me sing through it.

339
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,633
I'll try to sing
as much as I can.

340
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,567
-<i> Milan kept talking over Kenya.</i>

341
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,800
- Maybe I--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

342
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Hold on, hold on.

343
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
- It's getting old. 
It's getting real damn old.

344
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,266
- Hello, hello, hello.

345
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,333
- Hi, RuPaul.

346
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,834
all: Hi!

347
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:10,734
- I want to know how my
infomercials are coming along.

348
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:11,767
- Come, Mother, come.

350
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,734
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Hi, Ru.

351
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:15,834
- Hi.

352
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,467
- Willam, what song
are you gonna do?

353
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:19,567
- I get to do<i> Click Clack.</i>

354
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,166
- And you're a shoe queen,
aren't you?

355
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,734
- I brought 34 pairs of shoes.

356
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:24,900
- [mouthing words]

357
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,867
- I have some great '80s shoes.

358
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,333
- Is the whole group
dressing '80s?

359
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,567
- Yes.

360
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,233
- So, Captain Kenya,
how did you decide on '80s?

361
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,233
- Personally speaking, I think,
as you listen to the album,

362
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,100
there's some '80s influence
going on.

363
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,233
We wanted to try to stay true
to the essence

364
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,767
and the influence of the album.

365
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,934
- Kenya?
Who is in charge here?

366
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,100
<i>Is it you or Milan?</i>

367
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,433
- We decided to share it.
- Yeah.

368
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,467
- Because, you know,
of the language barrier.

369
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,567
- Right.

370
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,867

<i>talked too much.</i>

<i>But I'm trying.</i>

373
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,967
- Princess, you've been known
here on the show

374
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,600
as sort of the quiet one,
the Zen one.

375
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,734
- Right, right.

376
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:01,400
- How are you gonna
put it all out there?

377
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,767
- I think I just haven't been

378
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,166
given the opportunity
to do that.

379
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,400
- Well, I don't know about that.

380
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,300
We've given you
a few opportunities.

381

right now to do it.

- How'd that happen?

- So, Sharon Needles,
what song are you gonna do?

393
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,867
- I'm going to be doing
<i>Cover Girl.</i>

394

-<i> Cover Girl?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

395

I'm going to be pitching it
to an alternative audience

396
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,667
who might think your music is,
uh, too dancy.

397
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,300
- Wait a minute.
Ex-squeeze me?

398
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,233
- Well, it is very dancy,
but it also, you know,

399
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,367
has other elements to it
that I think works

400
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,567
for all audiences.

401
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,100
- Uh-huh.

402
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,133
Dida.
What song are you doing?

403
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,300
- I'm doing Stepford wife
dancing to RuPaul's<i> Main Event.</i>

404
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,767
And when she hears this song,

405
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,900
it reminds her of the fun
that she had.

406
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,333
- Ah.

407
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,200
So maybe she was a<i> Solid Gold</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dancer in another life?

408
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,800
- Maybe; maybe she was one of
a pole dancer back in the day.

409
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,767
- [laughing]

410
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:14,500
- Jiggly Caliente,
some of your teammates

411
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,166
gave you a little shade
on the runway last week.

412
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,900
Why do you think so many people

413
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,367
chose you as the person
who should go home?

414
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,834
- Probably because they still

415
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,400
<i>don't understand everything</i>
<i>about me.</i>

416
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,934
They'll have to get
to know me first.

417
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,367
- When will they get
to know you?

418
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:33,233
In this competition, if you
really want to really go for it,

419
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,867
it's not something to do
with anybody else.

420
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,633
It's got to come from yourself.

421
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,767
I want to ask,
have you guys had time

422
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,300
to work on your
group number yet?

423
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,967
- No, we haven't.
- We wanted to paint first.

424
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,333
- Oh, dear.

425
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,100
Are you a little worried
about the group number?

426
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,066
- No, we're not worried.

427

- I am.
-<i> Okay.</i>

<i>It was embarrassing to me.</i>

430

- You don't want to get clocked
by RuPaul.

431
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,900
You don't want to get clocked
by Supermodel.

432

You don't.
You don't.

Girl from the 6 train.

521
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,467
- Now it's our team's turn
to do the infomercial

522
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:12,133
to sell RuPaul's album<i> Champion.</i>

523
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,200
- And...action.

524
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,100
<i>♪ And I don't care ♪</i>

525
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,834
<i>♪ If people stare ♪</i>

526
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:18,934
Cut.

527
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:20,533
<i>Give it all you got this time.</i>

528
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,533
And...action.

529
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,200
<i>♪ Yeah, up on the flashlights ♪</i>

530
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,734
<i>♪ No, don't be ♪</i>

531
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,367
-<i> I feel amazing</i>
<i>during the shoot.</i>

532
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,734
<i>Ru's laughing.</i>
<i>Michelle's laughing.</i>

533
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,266
I'm giving 'em, you know,
Phi Phi fierce the house down.

534
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,100
-<i> ♪ Lookin',</i>
<i>don't be jealous of my boogie ♪</i>

535
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
<i>Action.</i>

536
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,433
- When I first heard<i> Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my madam said,

537
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,567
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."

538
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,066
- Cut.
It's not what in your panties?

539
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,900
- Soy sauce.
- Oh.

540
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,633
<i>Sell it.</i>
<i>You got to sell it, okay?</i>

541
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,400
But that was--
that's--that's good.

542
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,200
- "That is not soy sauce
in your panties.

543
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,867
"That is happy endings.

544
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:56,767
Semen."

545
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,433
- [laughing]
Oh, my God.

546
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,467
- Sorry.

547
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,667
- Action.

548
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,467
- When I first heard
RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl,</i>

549
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,033
I was covered in blood.

550
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,633
I was slaughtering
a sacrificial lamb.

551
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,867
- Cut.

552
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,900
The thing here is,
if it's supposed to be funny,

553
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,834
<i>make it funny.</i>

554
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,333
<i>Let's do one more.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Sure.

555
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,834
Phi Phi told me to do
just my spooky shtick.

556
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,066
<i>But they're just not really</i>
<i>getting it.</i>

557
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,533
-<i> You have one take left.</i>

558
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,667
Make it work for you, okay?

559
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,667
- Okay.

560
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,667
Though I may dabble
in the black arts,

561
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:30,000
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,066
-<i> Cut.</i>

563
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,834
- [sighs]
This is a mess.

564
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,266
- One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,

565
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,600
and<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>
by RuPaul.

566
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,867
It reminds me of the main event

567
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,133
that happens in the bedroom
with my husband.

568
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:45,066
- So you're making a--
a sexual innuendo there.

569
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,467
- No.

570
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,367
-<i> I think you've got to sell</i>
<i>that a little bit more.</i>

571
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,133
- It reminded me
of the main event

572
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,600
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.

573
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,667
-<i> Cut.</i>

574
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,667
I like to go as far as possible

575
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,300
and have the director
pull me back.

576
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,734
-<i> Okay.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- You know?

577
00:20:58,734 --> 00:20:59,734
- Okay.

578
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,200
This is bad.
I'm feeling nervous.

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,734
I'm feeling scared.

580
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,934
<i>I'm really screwing this up</i>
<i>right now in front of RuPaul.</i>

581
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,266
It reminded me of the main event

582
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,567
that was gonna happen later on
with my husband.

583
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,633
[giggles]

584
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:12,900
-<i> Okay, cut.</i>

585
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,633
<i>We'll see you on the flip side.</i>

586
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,567
[alarm buzzing]

587
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,200
- All right,<i> Mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Elimination day.

588
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,166
- Come on.
- No!

589
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,934
- I'm so nervous about today.

590
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,233
- Why are you nervous?

591
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,066
- Because I was terrible.

592
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,066
I'm just shaking in my boots
right now

593
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,533
and preparing myself
for the worst.

594
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,433
I just felt like I was working
with a whole bunch of amateurs.

595
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,066
- Sharon's scared because now

596
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,700
he's in the same boat
as all of us

597
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,367
and he doesn't have immunity.

598
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,667
- And the only reason
why he's scared

599
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,467
is 'cause he didn't steal
the show.

600
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,133
- I stole the show!

601
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,066
<i>I don't want to stress out</i>
<i>anymore</i>

602
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,133
<i>worrying about what Sharon</i>
<i>thinks of me.</i>

603
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,433
<i>I picked a character for her</i>
<i>that she can excel in.</i>

604
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,867
She has one good character,
so she might as well use it.

605
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,667
Bitch, shut the fuck up.
This is my team.

606
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,233
- Right.

607
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,700
- I feel like
I'm in high school.

608
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,433
"Can I sit by you?"

609
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,900
-<i> So have you met</i>
<i>your boyfriend's parents?</i>

610
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,800
- Never. Yeah, we've never met
each other's parents.

611
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,066
<i>It's like, our parents</i>
<i>don't mind that we're gay,</i>

612
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:22,400
<i>but it's like, they still don't</i>
<i>look at it as a real family.</i>

613
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,500
- My family was not very pleased

614
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
when they found out
that I did drag.

615
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,066
Not everybody.
Some people are very supportive.

616
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:31,834
Like, my mom and my stepdad
are amazing.

617
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,800
<i>They're absolutely supportive.</i>

618
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,100
Other people in my family are
not so thrilled with it.

619
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,433
My dad found out
I was doing drag.

620
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,066
He wrote me a letter and said,

621
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,667
"You're an embarrassment
to the family.

622
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:46,066
Change your name.
Move far away."

623
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,867
Basically didn't want any
contact with me whatsoever.

624
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,867
It's tough when people
that you love

625
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,200
don't agree
with what you're doing.

626
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,166
- It sucks. It sucks.

627
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,266
I haven't spoken to my parents

628
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:57,166
in I don't know how long,
really,

629
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,400
<i>and they don't know I'm here.</i>

630
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
- Wait, they don't even know
you're here?

631
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
- I come from a very, you know,
religious background.

632
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,734
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be proud of me.</i>

633
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,367
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be embarrassed by me.</i>

634
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,300
I just feel like my family
just doesn't understand

635
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,967
<i>the fact that I do what I do,</i>
<i>and it's kind of put</i>

636
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,900
this distance between us.

637
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,367
I never make an effort to even

638
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,367
try to pick up the phone
and call them

639
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,800
because I don't like to go home.

640
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,100
- We both lost our mom just,
you know, four years ago,

641
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,166
and tomorrow's not promised.

642
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,533
Just don't put that wall up,

643
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,767
because you will regret it.

644
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:31,233
And I have to live with the fact
that I didn't see my mom

645
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,333
for over ten years.

646
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,834
- I don't want to, like,

647
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,934
get this phone call that, like,
something has happened

648
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,400
and know that, like, the last--

649
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
the last, like, time
I spoke to my mother

650
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,233
was--you know,
and how my feelings were.

651
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,166
- You only have one family.

652
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,367
-<i> [laughing]</i>

653
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,400

654
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,367
- Hey, guys.

00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:09,500
- Hey, Ru.
-<i> Hey, gorgeous.</i>

656
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,834
- Hey.
- Whoo!

657
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:13,066
- Michelle Visage.

658
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,133
Hi, Mama.

659
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,667
- Hi, baby. How are you?
-<i> Great.</i>

660
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,867
I can see that you're
broadcasting in stereo tonight.

661
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,767
- Is there any other way?
- [chuckles]

<i>Hey, Santino.</i>

663
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,066
Or--or should I say<i> shalom?</i>

664
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,900
- Ha, ha.<i> Shalom.</i>

665
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,567
- How about the beautiful
and talented Amber Riley?

666
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,967
Welcome.
- Thank you.

667
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm so excited to be here.

668
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,500
- We're excited to have you.

669
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,467
I'm a big Gleek.

<i>Miss Natalie Cole.</i>

673
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,834

674
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,867
- This will be unforgettable.

675
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,066
- It already is.

676
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,166
- Good.

677
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,800
This week, our queens
produced and starred

678
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,533
in TV infomercials
to sell my greatest hits.

679
00:24:56,533 --> 00:25:00,934
And tonight, they're ready
to take a spin down the runway

680
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,934
in platinum and gold.

681
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,100
Gentlemen, start your engines.

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,633
And may the best woman win.

683

uh, RuPaul<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album</i>
or somethin'?

864
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:38,800
- Oh, RuPaul's music
always brings me back.

865
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
- You know what, girl?

866
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,967
Like, there's so many songs

867
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,233
that, like, have so many
good memories

868
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:47,066
that it's hard to, like,
pick one, you know, Mamas?

869
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:50,567
- Luckily, now we don't have to.

870
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,867

and then<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>

880
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,667
It reminded me of the main event

881
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,667

I was covered in blood.

And though I may dabble
in the black arts,

897
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:02,934

I see the light.

[loud cheers and laughter]

907
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,133
- That was dragnificent, ladies.

908
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,300
If I were watching back at home,

909
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,834
I would place my order
right now.

910
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,834
I mean, really.
Do it now.

911

<i>All right, ladies.</i>

But tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.

00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,934
When I call your name,
please step forward.

915

Milan.

916
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:54,433
Willam.

917
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,066
Latrice Royale.

00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,533
Jiggly Caliente.

919
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:03,367
Phi Phi O'Hara.

920
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:08,567
This week, you did not reach
the top of the charts.

921
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:11,934
You are safe.

922
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:13,567
You may leave the stage.

923
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,367
Ladies, you represent
this week's hits and flops.

924
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:26,433
And now it's time
to face the music.

925
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,567
Madame LaQueer.

926
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,066
- Hello.<i> Hola.</i>

927
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,467
- Let's go to Natalie Cole.

928
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,800
- I love your essence.

929
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,667
But I don't like the outfit.

930
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:42,266
- When I hear gold and platinum,
I think classier.

931
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:44,967
<i>The color green reminds me</i>
<i>of fungus.</i>

932
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,066
<i>In the video in the pitch,</i>

933
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,800
little bit too much Spanish,
so remember that.

934
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,433
- I think you were being true
to yourself, though,

935
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:51,567
with the Spanish.

936
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,467
<i>It was really funny.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thank you.

937
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,333
- But I think that that's a
place where you're comfortable.

938
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,867
I would encourage you to kind of
push yourself a little bit.

939
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,633
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.

940
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,400
- I think you're
an amazing actress.

941
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,133
I thought it was just
the right amount of trashy,

942
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:08,433
<i>tongue-in-cheek.</i>

943
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,667
- You do everything flawlessly
from beginning to end.

944
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,900
It's obvious.

945
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,767
I want to see you let go
of that perfection.

946
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,400
I want to see more
of who you are.

947
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,633
- Princess.
Love the look.

948
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:22,667
- Thank you.

949
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,066
- Your hosting skills
weren't really

950
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,700
at the same level
as Chad Michaels'.

951
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,967
- You were extremely flat.

952
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,500
We've told this to you before.

953
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,767
You've got to be aware
of going above and beyond

954
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,734
<i>and out of your comfort zone.</i>

955
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,834
You in particular, Princess.

956
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,066
- Kenya Michaels.

957
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,266
- Hi.

958
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,867
- You come out here
in this directional ensemble.

959
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:46,266
<i>I was just, like,</i>
<i>following every curve.</i>

960
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:49,100
- I really loved
your performance.

961
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,433
It was so sick
that it was right.

962
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,667
-<i> Thanks, Kenya.</i>

963
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:53,734
Dida Ritz.

964
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,066
-<i> Hey, Dida.</i>

965
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,633
I love your ensemble tonight.

966
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,133
<i>Your body is amazing.</i>

967
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,066
I wondered why you chose

968
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>the character you played</i>
<i>in the video.</i>

969
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,300
-<i> I wanted to do</i>
<i>something different.</i>

970
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,633
Tall, leggy, sexy Dida
is kind of something

971
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,867
that I don't want
to get comfortable doing.

972
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,500
- It's good that you did
take a risk,

973
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,767
<i>but you looked uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and if you're gonna</i>

974
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,567
do something out of your
comfort zone,

975
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:19,400
you have to commit to it.

976
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,300
- Next up, Sharon Needles.

977
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,700
<i>Tell me about your</i>
<i>infomercial presentation.</i>

978
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,433
Did you work well with Phi Phi?

979
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,700
- She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.

980
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,233
<i>Basically, what she said is,</i>
<i>"You're spooky.</i>

981
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,367
Dress like a monster."

982
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,266
But I used it as a way
to sell your records.

983
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,100
- Well, you do spooky very well.

984
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,834
- Boo.
- [whimpering]

985
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,734
- I didn't even get
the name right away.

986
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,133
[laughter]

987
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,700
It just went whoop,
right over my head.

988
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,400
- All in the past, Miss Cole.

989
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,667
- Okay.

990
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,133
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.

991
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,100
- Well, yes, um--
- [laughing]

992
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,266
-<i> The presentation was eerie</i>

993
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:54,200
<i>and all that you wanted it</i>
<i>to be.</i>

994
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
<i>It kind of freaked me out</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

995
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
I really liked it.

996
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,166
-<i> I love that Swarovski crystal</i>
<i>pompadour you got on.</i>

997
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:03,266
But I wish I couldn't see
the lower half of your body.

998
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:07,600
It kind of looks like
a store-bought thing.

999
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,667
-<i> Well, ladies, I think</i>
<i>we've heard enough.</i>

1000
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,800
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

1001
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,066
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

1002
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,333
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>

1003
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,166
You may leave the stage.

1004
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:23,700
All right, just between
us girls, who is your favorite?

1005
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,266
- I go with personality.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

1006
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:28,934
-<i> I think that Sharon Needles</i>
<i>has got a great sense of humor.</i>

1007
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:30,066
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

1008
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:31,567
- For me, it's between
Sharon Needles

1009
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:32,867
and Kenya Michaels.

1010
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,266
<i>I really like Kenya.</i>

1011
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:38,700
She has less of a handle
on the English language,

1012
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,600
but she was able to just
push through it

1013
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,567
and just have fun.

1014
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,433
- Yes.
She sold it.

1015
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,667
It was from the heart.

1016
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,300
You felt that she wanted
to bring out the inner beast

1017
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,567
and get her rebel on.

1018
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,166
- Chad is my absolute favorite.

1019
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,233
<i>She's so glam and so seasoned.</i>

1020
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,433
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

1021
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,066
<i>I just kept staring at her</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

1022
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,967
-<i> Okay.</i>

1023
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,066
Now, here is the hard part.

1024
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,133
Who are the bottom two?

1025
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:04,367
- You know, I would kind of
have to say

1026
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,533
<i>Princess and Madame LaQueer.</i>

1027
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,233
- Princess and Madame LaQueer.
And why?

1028
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:12,100
-<i> Madame LaQueer, she's just</i>
<i>not quite ready for prime time.</i>

1029
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,066
And although Miss Princess' look
is great,

1030
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,800
we're talking about bringing
people that are gonna win...

1031
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,834
- Yes.

1032
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,500
- Because they're already
so close.

1033
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,133
I don't think she's that close.

1034
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,300
- The Princess--I'm getting
nothing from her.

1035
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,734
I think I'd like to see more
from Madame LaQueer.

1036
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,367
She's a fierce queen.
- Yeah.

1037
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:30,166
- I'm gonna have to say Dida.

1038
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,667
<i>I just don't know.</i>

1039
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,734
<i>I'm confused by her 'cause</i>
<i>the walk on the runway--</i>

1040
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,567
That walk is saying,
"I am here. I am fierce."

1041
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,066
<i>But the video--</i>

1042
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,166
<i>I think Dida thought</i>
<i>that the costume</i>

1043
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,300
<i>was gonna do the work for her.</i>

1044
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,567
- Right, I don't think
she understands

1045
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:46,066
<i>that that walk that she</i>
<i>displays on the runway</i>

1046
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:48,767
can be transferred
into every challenge,

1047
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:49,734
into her everyday life.

1048
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,266
- I like to see people
who are the shit

1049
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,367
and know they're the shit.

1050
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:54,433
No apologies.

1051
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,467

00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,633

1053
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:57,667

you'll be working in pairs

182
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,166
to create your own
presidential campaign ads.

183
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,333
You need to both
promote yourself

184

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,567
Cut. Deliver it more.

356
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,700
Punch the words, you know?
Action.

357
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,433
America's first drag president
must speak as--

358
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,533
Fuck. Sorry.

359
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,934
Cut.
It's all about attitude.

360
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,934
This is a shady
political campaign.

361
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,633
I know
you know how to be shady.

362
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,200
[laughter]

363
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,300
Have you been watching
this season?

364
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,066
[laughs]

365
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,133
For my thing,
I'm using food as a metaphor,

366
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,900
and I'm smearing Naomi
by how skinny she is,

367
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,300
and we shouldn't trust her.

368
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,834
The biggest worry
I have for this challenge

369
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,300
is being able to speak clearly

370
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,367
and the judges being able to
understand my sense of "humor."

371
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,467
Here we go.
And action.

372
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,066
She acts like
she's the skinniest queen,

373
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,700
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.

374
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,266
More forcefully.

375
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,500
Remember to enunciate.

376
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,066
-All right.
-Action.

377
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,133
She acts like she's
the skinniest queen,

378
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,533
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.

379
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,633
Cut.
I think I'm seeing the words

380
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,433
as they're coming out of
your mouth, like, on paper.

381
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,800
Let that all go.

382
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,467
Let's move on.
Moving on.

383
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,333
Let's do the B-roll.
Action.

384
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,400
-What a fat ass.
-Cut.

385
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,300
The inflection
should go down at the end.

386
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Not, "What a fat ass?"
But, "What a fat ass."

387
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,533
What a fat ass.

388
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,700
(both) What a fat ass.

389
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,600
What a fat ass.

390
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,266
You went up again.

391
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,967
I'm nervous for Kim

392
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,500
just because she did get
a lot of notes,

393
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,600
and she's not
feeling confident,

394
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,400
so I'm scared
that my friend could go home.

395
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,066
-Good, move on.
-Okay.

396
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,700
Thorgy Thor
and Chi Chi DeVayne.

397
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,767
-Hi.
-Hi.

398
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,967
Hi.

399
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,400
I ain't gonna lie.
I'm a little nervous,

400
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,500
but I just want to present
in a professional way.

401
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,166
All right, Chi Chi,
you're up.

402
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,433
And action.

403
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,066
Thorgy Thor
is always caught looking

404
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,600
like she works
for children's parties.

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,100
Do you really want Bozo
running your country?

406
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,200
-I think not.
-Cut.

407
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,467
Okay, you sounded like
John Wayne,

408
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,500
which is really weird.

409
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,467
[laughs]

410
00:14:58,467 --> 00:14:59,900
I say lose the deep voice.

411
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,300
It's a little too literal
and deadpan.

412
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,233
Like, it needs
a little bit of flair.

413
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,400
Yes.

414
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,934
You got that great
Louisiana accent.

415
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,166
I'm struggling with this
because where I'm from,

416
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,800
being country
is not the thing to be.

417
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,400
<i>I kind of want</i>
<i>to seem presidential.</i>

418
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,934
Damn.

419
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,500
Thorgy Thor for president.

420
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,166
Go for it, and give it
all you got.

421
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,967
I'm just gonna shorten it.

422
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,300
-Okay.
-All right.

423
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,367
And action.

424
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,200
My name is Thorgy Thor,

425
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,100
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president

426
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,533
of the United States of America.

427
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,500
[laughs]

428
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,400
Good job. Next scene.

429
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:38,400

No, I just like to kid.

What is that?

-It looks expensive.
-Focus, Thorgy. Focus.

445
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,400
-Sorry.
-And action.

446

goes straight for the bottle..

-That was excellent.

-Oh, yeah.

Fuck,

All right, this
is gonna be simple.

-It's gonna be easy.
-(Michelle Visage) Action.

453
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,133
What are they gonna do
with canned food, by the way?

454

reaches for the booze.

00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,066
I was in Albany,
in the capitol building,

00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,633
when marriage equality passed.

480
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,700
In 2010, me and a couple
of my friends

481
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,166
decided to get together
and do something

482
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,600
about the inequalities

483
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,533
we experience
in the gay community,

00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,667

to go get arrested

494
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,567
but just something,
something as simple as voting.

495
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,767
It is really important
because politicians,

496
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,133
they literally make very real

497
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,333
and very, very important
decisions for you.

498
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,533

00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,500
something about it
before it happened.

500
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,834
Well, you can definitely
do something about it.

in South Korea.

512

Would you go back
to South Korea or no?

513
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,166
Oh, definitely, but there's
no drag culture there.

any gay culture.

00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,700
When I'm elected, there will be
no more parking tickets,

704
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,066
and officers will be trained to
give free injectable cosmetics.

705
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,133
Free Restylane for all!

706
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:40,100
I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise
to represent you fiercely.

707
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,300
[camera flashes]

708
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,066
This ad was paid for
by citizens

709
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,166
against non-lacefront wigs.

710
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,834
[laughter]

711
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,333
You made some campaign
promises

712
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,300
that really appeal to me.

713
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,166
[laughter]

714
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,066
I loved that
your commercial was really

715
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:57,600
all about being
a drag president,

716
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,333
about being fabulous.

717
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,133
Tonight on the runway, wow.

718
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,600
I mean, you look ultra
glamorous.

719
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,133
(Carson Kressley) And then
the hip with the padding.

720
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,734
Yeah, the padding
is phenomenal.

721
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,066
I think it's my favorite look
on the runway.

722
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,100
Thank you.

723
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,967
Up next, Kim Chi.

724
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,367
Let's take a look.

725
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,166
Hi, I'm Kim Chi,

726
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,333
and you want me
as your first drag president.

727
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,166
Naomi Smalls says
beauty is pain,

728
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,233
but is she aware of
the consequences of her actions?

729
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,467
America is a kitchen
that needs a strong chef

730
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,600
and never trust a skinny cook.

731
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,333
Small body, small mind.

732
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,500
She thinks she's
the skinniest queen,

733
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,433
but her waist is 22 inches.

734
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,567
What a fat ass.

735
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:42,200
Shady gays believe in no fats,

736
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
no fems, and no Asians.

737
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,433
As someone who is
all of the above,

738
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,533
I understand your pain.

739
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,400
My name is Kim Chi,

740
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,767
and say hello to yellow.

741
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,367
This ad was paid
out of my own pocket

742
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:56,667
because no one cares.

743
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:57,633
Do you?

744
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:00,333
[laughter]

745
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,967
When you came on,
you didn't break.

746
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,133
You did the whole mime thing.

747
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,333
But the best part
was your makeup.

748
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,633
Absolutely stunning.

749
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,066
But your ad.

750
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,734
I don't think it really got
the job done as far as

751
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,934
what the challenge was,
which was to be shady.

752
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,100
We did have
to work quite a bit

753
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,500
with you and your inflections.

754
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,467
-It was challenging.
-It was challenging.

755
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:23,700
It's just--I don't think
you're a big speaker.

756
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,266
I do have, like, a bit
of a fear of public speaking,

757
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:29,867
so to be able
to just enunciate clearly

758
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:32,233
is something I've struggled
with for a long time,

759
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,700
and I tried my best and--

760
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,533
Are you okay, boo?

761
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,233
Yeah, I'm fine.

762
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,533
I wouldn't be so hard
on myself if I were you.

763
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,934
It's just that you've got
some really tough competitors,

764
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,233
and we're down to that place

765
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,767
where we have to really
give harsh critiques, you know?

766
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:58,300
-Next up, Thorgy Thor.
-Hello.

767
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,266
Let's take a look
at your political shadiness.

768
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,600
Shoo.

769
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,834
Hello, good Americans.

770
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,433
My name is Thorgy Thor,

771
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,166
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president

772
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,133
of the United States of America.

773
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:13,734
You need somebody you can trust.

774
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,767
I've never told a lie,
and I'm not about to begin now.

775
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,934
This is my real hair.

776
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,567
My opponent Chi Chi DeVayne

777
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,667
once drank too many
wine coolers in college,

778
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,767
and she threw up on the floor.

779
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,433
Now she visits
recovering addicts

780
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,400
and feeds food to the homeless?

781
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,266
I'm not buying it.

782
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:36,066
Chi Chi's hand always
goes straight for the bottle.

783
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:38,233
My top priority is health care.

784
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,333
That's why I'm sending
a very expensive bottle

785
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,133
of champagne
to every home in America.

786
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:46,100
Cheers to
your health and mine.

787
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,633
[laughs]

788
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,133
Whoo!

789
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,934
Thorgy Thor for president,

790
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:55,533
because I'm more powerful
than you.

791
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,433
Hmm.

792
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,767
-[laughs]
-All right.

793
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,166
[applause]

794
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,667
Let's start
with your runway look.

795
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,400
It's not the most glamorous look
on the runway.

796
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I think you look
like a dead Boy George.

797
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,333
I was very entertained
by your character.

798
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,066
I thought it was
a little Joan Crawford,

799
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:10,967
Faye Dunaway...

800
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,600
-Thank you.
-Over-the-top.

801
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,734
But I got totally confused

802
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,467
when you were
passing out the food,

803
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:18,233
and then you didn't see
anything about the booze,

804
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,066
and I was kind of--
I got a little lost on that.

805
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,734
Michelle even asked you,

806
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:25,100
"Don't you want to do, like,
a boozy cutaway of Chi Chi?"

807
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,633
And we never saw that.

808
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,066
And in an ad of this length,

809
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,066
you need to show us,
not tell us,

810
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,600
so that was a fail for me.

811
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,433
There was, like, no smear
in that smear campaign.

812
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:39,066
Also, there was no tagline,
like, no paid-for line.

813
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,333
The difficult thing
was to cut down

814
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,467
exactly what material

815
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:43,066
I wanted to come across
with this character.

816
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,367
There were too many ideas.

817
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,633
That's been
a critique of you

818
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:48,300
throughout the competition
is learning how to edit.

819
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,600
You're right.
I could keep--

820
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
I always just keep going,
keep going, and going.

821
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,934
It is difficult to shut
my thought processes down.

822
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,567
Thank you, Thorgy.

823
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:00,100
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

824
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,667
Okay.

825
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,867
<i>I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>

826
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,400
<i>and I approve</i>
<i>this message, girl.</i>

827
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,767
I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,

828
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,633
and I should be
your next drag president

829
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:11,133
because I'm real, chill,

830
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:14,000
and my makeup don't peel.

831
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,967
<i>But my opponent Thorgy Thor</i>
<i>is always caught looking</i>

832
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,233
<i>like she works</i>
<i>for children's parties.</i>

833
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,233
<i>Do you really want a clown</i>
<i>running your country?</i>

834
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,633
<i>I think not.</i>

835
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:27,266
Meanwhile,
I'm working to ensure

836
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:30,467
that every American
has a pot to piss in

837
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,166
and a window to throw it out.

838
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,333
And in that same pot,

839
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,633
there'll be chitlins
boiling for all.

840
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,300
<i>Thorgy want America</i>
<i>to walk around</i>

841
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>with horrible hip pads</i>
<i>that resemble Peggy Bundy.</i>

842
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,166
<i>Who wants to walk around</i>
<i>with a FUPA?</i>

843
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,734
America says,
"Not me, Thorgy Thor."

844
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,367
(voice)<i> This message</i>
<i>has been paid for</i>

845
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,900
<i>by citizens who like to eat</i>
<i>rare and unusual animal parts.</i>

846
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,100
-Oh!
-[laughter]

847
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,533
Well.

848
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,834
I really love
this sassy character.

849
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:03,433
However, your smear campaign,

850
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,066
you could've drug her ass

851
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,734
through the mud
a whole lot more,

852
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,333
is all I'm gonna
really tell you.

853
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,066
The look was a bit
shocking to me.

854
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:11,300
You're a drag queen president.

855
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,533
I didn't feel like there was
any "zjooshing" up.

856
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,133
You were, like,
rocking the Wanda Sykes

857
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,333
as assistant
in "Monster-in-Law" look.

858
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,834
I wasn't a fan.

859
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:22,633
I do think there really
wasn't any smear in there,

860
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,934
and I think for both of you,
you were too nice to each other.

861
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:26,200
Just remember
what the challenge is.

862
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,900
You came in
in kind of a character,

863
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,700
and I think we just had
to push you a little bit

864
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,767
for you to be in your skin.

865
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,367
And that's the key for you,

866
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,567
is to just own
that bayou charm.

867
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,533
[sighs]

868
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,133
Where I come from,
it's damn hard

869
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,433
to get out of the ghetto,
to get out of that,

870
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,533
and I think that's why I kind
of--I don't want to be ghetto.

871
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,633
You know what I mean?
Because I feel like--

872
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,934
Let me just tell you this.
Let me stop you here.

873
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:52,233
Just be you.

874
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:54,066
Honey, that's why we sent you
a plane ticket.

875
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,867
You know, we don't need you
to be somebody else.

876
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,400
I do want to say

877
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,100
that this my sixth season
doing this,

878
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,400
and I have not seen such
a strong set of girls before.

879
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,433
There is not one of you
that was terrible at all.

880
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,567
This is what
we're up against as judges.

881
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,133
Thank you, ladies.

882
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,400
While you untuck backstage,

883
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,433
the judges
and I will deliberate.

884
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:21,567
Just between us swing voters,
what do you think?

885
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,667
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob nailed it.

886
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,500
She's great at the comedy.

887
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,767
She was great at the writing.
She was great at the acting.

888
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,400
Bob had gravitas
in that campaign.

889
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,700
You are in love
with that word.

890
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,367
I still don't even
know what it means.

891
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:35,767
-I know, I want to--tell me.
-It means "heft."

892
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,967
Like a fat ass kind of heft?

893
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:39,200
Gravit-ass.

894
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,834
(RuPaul) Derrick Barry.

895
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,333
When she was Derrick Bachmann,
I think she smeared Bob,

896
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,734
and she smeared him well.

897
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:48,133
She had a really good, campy,

898
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,633
fun time with him.

899
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,166
Those two have a history
of being rivals,

900
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,400
and they made it
work for them.

901
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,500
This is like what
I do every week

902
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,900
with Michelle Visage.

903
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,800
[laughter]

904
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,867
Naomi Smalls.

905
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:04,333
She was the only one
that threw actual shade.

906
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,900
And she's so likeable.

907
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,400
Now, that runway,
she was padded for Jesus.

908
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Gorgeous.

909
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,667
Naomi has risen
to the occasion,

910
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,600
and that's the kind of progress
we love in this competition.

911
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,166
(RuPaul) Kim Chi.

912
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,333
Her shade part
with Naomi was "eh."

913
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,066
I didn't know whether or not
she was doing a campaign ad

914
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,400
or if she was doing a food ad.

915
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,066
But this kid
is so imaginative,

916
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,266
and then she brought up
the no fats, no fems,

917
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:33,467
no Asians thing,
which was very political,

918
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,467
the fact that gay people
are fighting for fairness.

919
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,500
But, you know, on Craigslist,

920
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,633
you're free to be as racist
and body shaming as possible.

921
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:42,934
-Really?
-Yeah.

922
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,667
I'm gonna take that
off my profile.

923
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,700

(RuPaul)
Thorgy Thor.

925
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,600
This runway tonight
was a swing and a miss.

926
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,633
I know she's wacky
and different,

927
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,066
but it should be cohesive.

928
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,734
The political campaign,

929
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,567
love the commitment
to the character

930
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,600
but it was kind
of too much about her.

931
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,200
She didn't do any
of the smear campaign at all,

932
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,700
and when she did, it was like,
"Oh, enough about you

933
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,500
but back to me."

934
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,066
Lots of ideas,
but you've got to land a punch.

935
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,633
Chi Chi DeVayne.

936
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,100
Tonight on the runway,

937
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,133
that is the best she's looked
this entire competition.

938
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:17,200
Unfortunately,
I was not a fan of

939
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,533
the political campaign.

940
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,266
That wasn't somebody

941
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,934
that could be
the first drag queen president.

942
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,433
When Chi Chi walked out
to meet Carson and I,

943
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:29,166
I literally though it was
James Brown coming out.

944
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,266
[laughter]

945
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,567
Silence.

946
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,633
Mm.

947
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,066
I've made my decision.

948
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:40,500
Bring back my girls,
Mr. Gorbachev!

- 30 minutes
is not a lot of time

a really good hairstyle,

117
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:41,734

I haven't won anything.
Everybody else has.

121
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,400
- I have no idea what I'm doing
with this hair.

122
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,967
I don't know how to style hair.
I'm not a hair stylist.

123
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,667
So I'm like,
"Shit, what do I do?"

124
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,600
- I'm thinking in my head,
"Think outside the box.

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,133
Pandora, think outside the box."

126
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,367
- I look over and I see Pandora
doing hers, and I'm like,

127
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,934
"It looks like Cindy Lou Who
from a Dr. Seuss book."

128
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm like,
"What the hell is she doing?"

129
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,800
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,166
That's right.

131
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,400
Rocker chicks,
turn your blow dryers off

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,734
and put those rat combs down.

133
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,600
All right,
let's start with Tyra.

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,633
Sit it right here.

135
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:28,700
- Anytime I see a video,

136
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,333
I always see 'em with, like,
a mohawk

137
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,066
and it's just, like, real poofy
and, like, puffed out.

138
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,867
I am happy
with how my hair looked.

139
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,867
It kind of reminded me
of Sasha Fierce.

140
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,266
All the other wigs
were a little trashy.

141
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,100
- My inspiration
was a little Joan Jett

142
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,734
but a little Pat Benatar.

143
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,400
- This is actually a nice cut,

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,834
but she's kind of
a conservative rocker chick.

145
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:52,066
It's more sort of a rocker mom.

146
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,367
Wow.

147
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:57,400
- She just finished a show with
her band, Thundercunt.

148
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,333
And afterwards,
there was a hotel party

149
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,233
and she got completely trashed.

150
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,800
- You might want to get her
into rehab.

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
- I don't know much
about rock and roll,

152
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,767
but I do enjoy the music
of Pat Benatar.

153
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,900
So I know her hair is short
and kind of powerful,

154
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,934
so I went--chose to go with,
like, a asymmetrical bob

155
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,734
and a little crimping.

156
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,500
- I'm wondering why
you didn't crimp more.

157
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,066
- Well, she's subtle.

158
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,100
- She's a subtle rocker chick.
- Yeah.

159
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,567
- This is Mustang Sally.

160
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,967
- Oh, is this her?
- This is her.

161
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,533
- I've heard of her.
- Yes.

162
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,066
- Pandora's hairstyle
was a mess.

163
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,266
It was like three Halloween
jack-o'-lanterns

164
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,333
stacked on top of each other.

165
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,734
- She has a guitar on her head.

166
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:31,734
The strings are right here.

167
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,867
- Oh, she sure does.

168
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,066
- Yes, and if you're lucky,

169
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,400
maybe she'll let you play
her head.

170
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,066
- It's like RuPaul does
Cyndi Lauper, doesn't it?

171
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,934
- My inspiration
is the cartoon from the '80s

172
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,100
<i>Jem and the Holograms.</i>

173
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
- Oh, yes,
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> yeah.</i>

174
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,200
- The rock band.
You can use tomorrow this.

175
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,600
- I will definitely consider
using that tomorrow.

176
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,667
- Thanks.

177
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,300
- It's always good
to have a backup.

178
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,066
All right, Jujubee.

179
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,934
She's got so much going on here.

180
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,066
- This is kind of like
the end of the week for her,

181
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,600
and she's getting ready
to go shopping for deli meats,

182
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,700
and she decided
to just put everything on.

183
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,300
- So girl to girl...

184
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,333
- Yeah?

185
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,800
- When did you lose control
of this wig?

186
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,066
- When I got the wig.
- [laughs]

187
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:16,300
Ladies, you all rocked
this challenge,

188
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,133
but there can only be
one winner, and that queen is...

189
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
Pandora Boxx.

190
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,066
Congratulations, Pandora.

191
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:30,066
You'll find out what you've won
in a moment.

192
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,700
For your main challenge,

193
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,533
you're going
to transform yourselves

194
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,066
into hot rocker chicks.

195
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,066
You can use your own drag,
plus materials provided

196
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:44,066
by Leg Avenue
and Michael Levine Fabrics.

197
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,200
I expect you to take
your charisma, uniqueness,

198
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,934
nerve, and talent

199
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:52,367
and amp it up to 11.

200
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,233
But wait.

201

♪<i> There's more ♪</i>

202
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,800
For this week's challenge, I'm
going to ask you to do something

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,834
that I've never asked any of
my girls to do before.

204
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:08,900
For the first time ever
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

205
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,800
each of you will be singing live

206
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,266
to a heavy metal version
of my song<i> Ladyboy.</i>

207
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:18,734
- My heart kind of just dropped.

208
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:21,266
I just don't want to do it.

209
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,867
- To help you prepare
for your singing debut,

210
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:27,500
you'll be working with one of
my favorite rocker chicks,

211
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,600
whose monster hits include
<i>No More Words</i>

212
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,467
and<i> Take My Breath Away.</i>

213
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:36,166
Their latest CD is called
<i>All The Way In.</i>

214
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm talking about the amazing
Terri Nunn from Berlin.

215
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,734
- I can't believe Terri Nunn's
gonna be coaching.

216
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,467
I can't believe
we're gonna meet Terri Nunn.

217
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,800
Terri fucking Nunn is here.

218
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,600
- Now, Pandora, since you won
the mini challenge,

219
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,266
you get an extra ten minutes
with Terri.

220
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:54,300
Gentlemen, start your engines.

221
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,166
And may the best woman win!

222
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,200

before?

227
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:12,567
- Yeah, I sing before
with the rock band Rebeldia.

228
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,166
I want to be a singer,
a drag singer.

229
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,433
If I don't win this challenge,

230
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,633
then what challenge
I'm going to win?

231
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,533
- Girl, I'm in the same boat
as you.

232
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,800
This is the perfect challenge
for me,

233
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,967
because I've heard every other
bitch in that room sing.

- ♪<i> This groove is for</i>

238
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:40,767
- I have such a big fear of
singing live for an audience.

239
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,667
And I'm really not excited
about it.

240
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,967
I'm gonna shit myself
on stage.

241
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,667
- That's rock.

242
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,266
- The main challenge today

243
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,900
is to make our own
rock and roll outfits.

244
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,100
And we will be performing
RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> live.</i>

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,834
- I am so excited.

246
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,033
- I'm nervous.
I'm so glad I have immunity.

247
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,600
- Do you know how to sing?

248
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,767
- The other day,
that was my real singing.

249
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,100
♪<i> Oh, ooh ♪</i>

250
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,800
I hope the judges don't tell me
to shut the fuck up.

251
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,100
- Does anybody have a pen?

252
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,800
Do you have a pen?

253
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,133
I need to rewrite the lyrics

254
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,400
so that it fits the tempo
that they sing it in,

255
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,500
'cause I can't visualize it
in my head.

256
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,400
This is the challenge
that I'm excited about.

257
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,934
I'm, like, 100% sure
that I'm gonna do fabulously.

258
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm very confident about this.

259
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,233
I'm not gonna fuck up.

260
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,367
- Hey, my little runaways.

261
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:41,300
- Hey, Ru.
- Just checking in.

262
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,967
Looks like the rock shop.

263
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,300
Tyra, tell me about your outfit.

264
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,967
- Because I don't know
too much about rock,

265
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm gonna try and go for
a more futuristic rock.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
- Have you seen
Tina Turner's videos

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
or seen her on television?

268
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,934
- The only time
I saw Tina perform

269
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,700
is when she performed
with Beyonce.

270
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,433
- Why did I know
that was the answer?

271
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,200
All right, Tyra,
keep on working.

272
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,500
- Thank you.

273
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,734
- I'm gonna ease on over here
to Miss Raven, who--

274
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,066
something tells me

275
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,066
there is a rocker chick
who lives constantly in you.

276
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,400
- Yes.

277
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,333
- Now, earlier in the run,
you said you don't sing at all.

278
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,700
- No.

279
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
- So how are--you feel confident
about doing this challenge?

280
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,867
- Yeah, I do, actually.

281
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:22,567
Like, I think that when it comes
to rock and roll,

282
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,100
it's about your stage presence.

283
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,867
That's such a good way to say,
"Fuck it."

284
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,433
- That's what rock and roll
is about.

285
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,834
Who do you think is your biggest
competition in this challenge?

286
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,433
- Jujubee.
- Why?

287
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,433
- Jujubee can sing.

288
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,100
She can sing,
and she can sing well.

289
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
- Maybe this challenge
is your opportunity

290
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,533
to really step it up.

291
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,633
- Well, I plan on it.
- Rock on.

292
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,066
I'll see you later.
All right.

293
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,266
- Bye.

294
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,066
- Jessica Wild.
- Hi, Ru.

295
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,266
- Look at you.
Are you ready for rock and roll?

296
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,734
- Yeah.
- Do you sing?

297
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:52,133
- I am not the best singer
of the world.

298
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:57,233
But I have the personality,
I have the energies,

299
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,667
and I have attitude.

300
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,100
- Yeah. Is this your
rocker chick hair right here?

301
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,300
- Yes, I am going to work
on that wig.

302
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,800
- Because Jessica Wild has
a signature movement,

303
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,533
and it's a hair flip?

304
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,700
- Yes.
- [laughs]

305
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,967
Okay.

306
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,200
Keep working.
- Thank you, Ru.

307
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,066
- Hey, Sahara.

308
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,467
Do you sing at all?

309
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,667
- I do sing,
but I've never done rock before.

310
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,266
- Now, you wound up
in the bottom two twice.

311
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,967
- Girl, don't remind me.
[laughs]

312
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,066
- What are you gonna do
this week to make sure

313
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,500
you don't find yourself
in the bottom two?

314
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,667
- I guess just overcoming myself

315
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,934
and being confident
and letting it out

316
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,600
and not hesitating
or holding back.

317
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,100
My confidence has been an issue
for a lot of my adult life,

318
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,300
and I guess it may be I'm afraid
of disappointing people.

319
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,433
- You ready to rock out?
- I'm ready.

320
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,834
Is that right?
[laughs]

321
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,567
- Tatianna, do you sing at all?

322
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,800
- I used to be in chorus,
but I would even lip-sync that,

323
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,066
'cause there would be
a group of us.

324
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,300
- Really?
- So I just mouthed the words.

325
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,333
- You were lip-synching for your
life in high school chorus?

326
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,533
- Yep, or I'd sing really soft.
- Why?

327
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,100
- Because I was really
made fun of a lot in school,

328
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,266
and so I really thought twice
about everything I did.

329
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,600
I started getting teased
for being gay

330
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
when I was in first grade.

331
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,967
I can't count
the amount of times

332
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,600
I was suspended for fighting.

333
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,834
- This is what I do.

334
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,367
And that voice that you're
talking about that says,

335
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,400
"You can't do that,"
that voice will always be there.

336
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,633
Look at me in the eye.

337
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,967
That voice will always be there.

338
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,066
What you have to do--
like muscles,

339
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,900
you have to counteract
that voice with another voice

340
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,967
that says,
"Thank you for sharing.

341
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:36,133
That was nice, but I'm gonna
do this over here."

342
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:39,100
This is your opportunity
to put this to the test.

343
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
So I want to see you go for it.
- Absolutely.

344
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,367
- All right, Tatianna.
- Thank you.

345
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,400
- Keep working.
- All right.

346
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,967
I think RuPaul
is really looking at me

347
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:50,633
and wanting to see that I don't
just fall back on my looks.

348
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,266
It definitely makes me want
to make him proud.

349
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,233
- Pandora.

350
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,066
Wow.
Lookit here.

351
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,066
Ooh, that's gonna move
really good.

00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,533
Have I seen you do this before?

353
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,433
- I don't think
I have done that.

354
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,967
- Do it with me now.

355
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,166
Ow!

356
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,667

360
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,066
- I slipped into Cher.
I don't know how.

361
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,433
- Now, throughout
the competition,

362
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:20,467
we've actually asked Pandora
to push it more.

363
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,066
- I definitely agree, 'cause
I'm not really a singer either,

364
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,967
so I'm really gonna have to go
out of my box,

365
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,166
which was what I was told
in the last challenge,

366
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,300
to think outside the box.

367
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,967
This is very beyond it, so...
- Yeah.

368
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,667
All right, good luck, Pandora.
- Thank you.

369
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,133
- All right.

00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,367
Jujubee.

- Hi, mama.
- Hi, baby.

372
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
- What's going on?

373
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
- When I've spoken
with the other girls,

374
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,834
their main concern is you.

375
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,300
- Why?
- Because they say you can sing.

376
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,734
Now, tell me about that.

377
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:50,700
- I can hold a note.

378
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,266
- What's surprising to me

379
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,633
is that you have not won
a challenge yet.

380
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,100
- I haven't,
and I want to win this one.

381
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,300
- How are you gonna do that?

382
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
How you gonna win
this challenge?

383
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,467
- I know that Ru's there
to challenge me,

384
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,767
and it reminded me
of how my father pushed me.

385
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,100
- This is definitely a chance

386
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,867
for you to come out of the
shadow of the other girls.

387
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,200
- My father died when I was 15,

388
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,300
and because he believed in me,
I believe in myself.

389
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,633
I know that's the reason
I perform.

390
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm gonna do it.
And I'm gonna make you happy.

391
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,567
I promise, girl.

Let's start with Jessica Wild.

807
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,266
You were into it right away.

808
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,533

00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,333
- Jessica Wild.

811
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,867
- Yes.
- You killed it.

812
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:39,600
If there was some critique,
the hair, it's a little wiggy.

813
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,867
- You used your hair as a
weapon, which I quite liked.

814
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:46,066
And also I truly believe that
you connected with the music,

815
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,734
so I thought you were fantastic.

816
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:49,200
- Thank you.
- Great.

817
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,867
Okay, Jujubee, you're next.

818
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,667
All the girls said
you were the one to watch

819
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,734
because you could sing.

820
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:58,066
I was surprised that you...

821
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:00,033
didn't know the words
to the song.

822
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,367
- It's a pretty simple song,

823
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:05,400
and I didn't learn it,
and I can't take it back.

824
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,800
I feel like a failure.

825
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,667
- Terri, what'd you think
of Jujubee's performance?

826
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,700
- I have to say, you did
need to know the words,

827
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,166
'cause the words for us singers
are the lines.

828
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,433
We got to know our lines,

829
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,600
and there's no excuse for that.

830
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,834
People come and pay money.

831
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:21,934
- Oh, Jujubee, today you were
off your game.

832
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:23,266
When you first came out,

833
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:26,500
I saw your lips moving,
but I couldn't even hear you.

834
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,033
Like, you almost were afraid
to hear your own voice.

835
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,033
- It occurred to me
during your performance

836
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:35,400
that the music seemed to be
more like incidental soundtrack.

837
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,667
You went in and out
of connecting with the lyric.

838
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,467
- I think everyone is just
a little disappointed.

839
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,667
- I am so devastated,

840
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,867
because not only
did I let the judges down;

841
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,533
I believe my father was there
watching me,

842
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,233
and I let him down.

843
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:52,100
- Next up, Pandora Boxx.

844
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,700
- You brought it.

845
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,500
You were a punk rocker
out there.

846
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,600
- Thank you.

847
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,800
- Pandora, I think
your outfit looks great.

848
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,066
It wasn't the best performance,

849
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,500
but I could tell that you
put in a lot of effort.

850
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,667
- I liked the aggressive
punk rock energy you brought,

851
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,834
although, for me,
there was moments

852
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,767
where you kind of got
a little happy,

853
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,967
where you started kind of
hopping around like, "Yay!"

854
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,233
I'm like, "No, no!"

855
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,800
When you're gonna go out
with some attitude,

856
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
just remember to stay with it.

857
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,367

Sahara Davenport.

860
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,100
Were some of the lyrics
a problem for you?

861
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,633
- Um, no, it was more breathing
and trying to focus

862
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:31,934
but not be so focused.

863
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,066
- I knew you were nervous.

864
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,433
I knew you were worried
about your voice.

865
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:35,734
I was like, "Oh, god," you know?

866
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,367
"Maybe she still hasn't
gotten over

867
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:38,700
being a little afraid of this."

868
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,500
You didn't know the words,
and that is important,

869
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,066
because people notice that.

870
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,533
You know, it's important
to them

871
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:47,700
that you care about the song,
because usually they're coming

872
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,533
'cause they care
about those songs too.

873
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,266
- You are very elegant

874
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:55,667
in that dancer, chic,
refined essence.

875
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:56,767
- But is that rocker chick?

876
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,233
- Well,
that's what I'm wondering.

877
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,100
I know it's probably hard
for you to let go,

878
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,266
because you do have
all that dance--

879
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,667
- Girl, I just did it.
I just let go, baby.

880
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,767
I mean, I don't know what else
you want from me, Merle.

881
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:05,967
I'm just a girly girl.

882
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,433
- Maybe I just wanted it
a little rougher.

883
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:11,066
- All right, next up, Tatianna.

884
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:13,667
- First, you were the biggest
improvement of everybody.

885
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,500
When we finished working
together yesterday,

886
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,233
I was scared for you,
because you were scared.

887
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:22,400
And you came in,
and you knew the words.

888
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,166
You brought it, and I know
how hard that was for you.

889
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,133
- Being Joey, I felt naked.

890
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,700
But as Tati, I feel like
I can do anything.

891
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,433
- T-a-t-i.

892
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,433
B-o-d-y.

893
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,266
Body, body, body, body.

894
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,200
You're still riding on
this body, and it's amazing.

895
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,567
I just wish you could bring
another element

896
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,066
to this overall look.

897
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,900
Bring it up to rock star level.

898
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,333
- Up next, Rockin' Raven.

899
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,200
Turn around; let's see
what you're working with.

900
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,867
- Oh, my god.
- Rock and roll, baby.

901
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:59,066
- Raven,
you come out with the ass.

902
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:01,533
Now I want girls.
You're hot as a girl.

903
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,066
- I've turned you
into a lesbian?

904
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,800
- I'm in.
- Yes!

905
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,633
- Remember at the beginning
of the season,

906
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,934
we were kind of giving you
a hard time about you're cold,

907
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,367
you have too much attitude?

908
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:14,266
Tonight you took that attitude
and you lit a match under it.

909
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:16,400
So it was like sneery,
"I'm better than you,"

910
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,967
but it was so perfect
for rock and roll.

911
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,367
- I enjoyed your performance,

912
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,667
because it seemed very much
in the moment.

913
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,433
You sold me completely.

914
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,066
- Thank you.

915
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,166
- Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.

916
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,467
- Instead of doing
kind of hardcore rock,

917
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,100
which everybody else did,
you did glamour.

918
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,400
I think it worked against you.

919
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,734
I felt like you were
more concerned with your look

920
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:37,333
than your performance.

921
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:41,100
- I thought the performance was
dominated by your clothing.

922
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,900
It seemed to keep you from
connecting with the music.

923
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,266
I don't think you brought
the rock to it.

924
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,100
- Thank you, for everyone,
for your critiques.

925
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,400
- Thank you.

926
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,934
Ladies, while you're enjoying
an Absolut cocktail

927
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:57,066
in the interior illusions
lounge,

928
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,734
the judges and I
will deliberate.

929
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,633
Thank you, ladies.

930
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,066
This is not gonna be easy.
- No.

931
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,767
- So let's start
with Jessica Wild.

932
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,433
- I thought she was fantastic.

933
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,700
It was ever changing,

934
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,767
yet she kept me with her
the entire time.

935
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,066
- Today I know
why she's still here.

936
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,400
- It was her conviction,
wasn't it?

937
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
- Yeah.

938
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,433
- Now, Pandora,
she did a great job too.

939
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:19,433
- She was unique in all of them,

940
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,433
because she just had a different
attitude than everybody else,

941
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:22,867
and it made her stand out.

942
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:25,367
- She came out, and she was
flipping us off and everything.

943
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,200
That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.

944
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,667
- She performed in a way

945
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,800
that I'd never thought, really,
Pandora could perform.

946
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,133
- Now, Sahara Davenport,

947
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:36,867
I saw her trying really hard,
but I wasn't convinced.

948
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,166
- I felt like she was playing
at being a rock star,

949
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,934
that she had, you know,
read a book about it

950
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,867
and so she was trying out
the moves.

951
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:45,266
I wasn't feeling
that she was really into it.

952
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,633
- There were great moments

953
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,800
where she lost her considerable
restraint and let loose,

954
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,066
but it wasn't consistent.

955
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:53,200
- Now Tatianna.

956
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,767
- I loved her look.

957
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,333
I loved that she tried for
something completely different.

958
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,600
You know, everybody thinks
rock is big hair,

959
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,166
and to me, it's about being
an original.

960
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,834
- It just kind of falls
in the middle for me.

961
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,667
I do wish that, you know,

962
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:08,266
with her youth
and beauty and body,

963
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,867
she would step it up
a little bit more.

964
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,467
- Now, I was very impressed
with Raven.

965
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,467
- Her look is just--
it's really intense.

966
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,200
I like that kind
of confrontation

967
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,066
that isn't necessarily violent
but it does make you deal,

968
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:21,900
'cause rock and roll
is about confrontation.

969
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,967
- Raven's guts
always win the day.

970
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,367
I thought it was extremely nervy
that she came out

971
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,066
with Terri Nunn hair
in front of Terri Nunn.

972
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:31,133
- For me, there were
two rock stars in this group,

973
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,200
and they were Jessica and Raven.

974
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,500
She just has that.

975
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,700
- Tyra.

976
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
- Tyra has immunity this week,
and if she didn't,

977
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,166
she would be lip-synching
for her life.

978
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,834
- She just kind of did, like,
a weak Beyonce imitation.

979
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:46,667
- And her twirling around was--
what are you doing, lady?

980
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,600
I don't care
if you don't like rock music.

981
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,300
Your job was to convince me that
you were rocking,

982
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,800
and she wasn't.

983
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,266
- The girl who shocked us all
was Jujubee.

984
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,400
- I had really big expectations
for her.

985
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,700
She's great.

986
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,200
We've all been wanting her
to win a challenge.

987
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,433
I thought
she could win this one.

988
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:04,900
- I did too.
- Yeah.

989
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,066
- Yeah, I thought that Jujubee
was gonna do really well.

990
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,567
When I saw her walk out here,

991
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,767
it's like watching someone
do karaoke really badly.

992
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:15,433
- And then she didn't know
the words, and, I mean,

993
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,834
that just comes across
as a performer who doesn't care.

994
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,367
- All right.
Silence!

995
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,734
I've made my decision.

996
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:26,133
Let's bring the girls back
to the main stage.

997
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,700
Welcome back, ladies.

998
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,066
Based on your rocker chick
challenge,

999
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,100
I've made some decisions.

1000
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,700
Tyra Sanchez, fortunately,
you won immunity last week.

1001
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,767
So you're safe tonight.

1002
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,734
Thank you, Tyra.

1003
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:43,066
Jessica Wild.

1004
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:44,500
Pandora Boxx.

1005
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,066
Raven.

1006
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:49,667
As rocker chicks, you ruled.

1007
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,500
But one of you
took this challenge

1008
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,533
and turned it into
a rock and roll fantasy.

1009
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:59,333
Jessica Wild...

1010
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,400
congratulations.

1011
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,467
You're the winner
of this challenge.

1012
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,100
[applause]

1013
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,700
- I am disappointed, because
I haven't won any challenges,

1014
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
but I've been close
to winning each time.

1015
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,500
- You have won
a $1,000 shopping spree.

1016
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,367
But Jessica?

1017
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:23,567
You have not won immunity
for next week.

1018
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:28,300
Ladies, moving forward,
there will be no more immunity.

1019
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,600
From here on in,
every moment counts.

1020
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,066
- Of course I feel a little mad.

1021
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,967
I win now,
and I don't have immunity.

1022
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:39,900
- Being told that there's
no more immunity left sucks.

1023
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,600
That's just going to show you,
"Look, bitches,

1024
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,667
it's getting serious."

1025
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:44,700
- Thank you, Jessica.

1026
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,066
- Thank you.
Gracias.

1027
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,767
Thanks.
[applause]

1028
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,967
- Thank you.

1029
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:54,600
- Pandora Boxx, you are the
Susan Lucci of this competition.

1030
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,233
- I am.
[laughter]

1031
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,867
- But you're safe.
- Thank you.

1032
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:05,800
- Rockin' Raven, your star

1035
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:13,467
Jujubee,
coming into this challenge,

1036
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:15,333
you were the one to beat.

1037
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,467
But you proved to be
your own worst enemy.

1038
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,166
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1039
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:27,567
- Ru is very disappointed in me.

1040
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,900
I let her down,
and I let myself down.

1041
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,333
- Tatianna, you were lost.

1042
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:37,467
But once again, you channeled
your inner Britney.

1043
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,600
You're safe.

1044
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,967
- Thank you.

1045
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,133
- Sahara Davenport.

1046
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1047
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,367
- You know,
before when I was in the bottom,

1048
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,700
I was freaking out.

1049
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,066
Like I've said
and I'll say it again,

1050
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,800
I came here to win,
and I'm not a quitter.

1051
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,066
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm gonna fight it out.

1052
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:57,734
- Two queens stand before me.

1053
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:03,066
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1054
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,233
and save yourselves
from elimination.

1055
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:10,500
The time has come for you
to lip-sync...

1056
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,834

1057
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,500
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

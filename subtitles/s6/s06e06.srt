"RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE..."

00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,433
- BITCH!

3
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:05,900
- LAGANJA AND I ARE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS,

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,700
BUT WHEN WE DO COMPETE,
THAT CAN GET UGLY.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,200
- IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"SNATCH GAME."

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,567
- I DON'T DO
IMPERSONATIONS.

7
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,633
- KIMMY.
- HA HA HA!

8
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,834
- WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE.
- BALONEY!

9
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,400
- HOW'S THE BABY?

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,066
- OH, YOU KNOW, I'M STILL, LIKE,
HAVING SOME MORNING AFTER...

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,133
IS THAT...YES, YOU KNOW,
LIKE THROWING UP AND STUFF

12
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,200
AFTER THE PREGNANCY.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,400
- BEN DE LA CREME, YOU'RE
THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,934
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SHANTE YOU STAY.

15
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:43,967
G-G-G-GIA,
SASHAY AWAY.

16
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,767

17
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:53,033
- CONGRATULATIONS,
LAGANJA.

- I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I AM
STILL IN THIS COMPETITION.

00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:59,700
- YES, GIRL, YOU MADE IT.
- YOU LIVE ANOTHER DAY.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,400
- BUT IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
I'M USED TO WINNING.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,934
SO IN THIS COMPETITION,

22
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:06,200
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE ALL
MY FRIENDS GET A LOT OF PRAISE,

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,567
ESPECIALLY ADORE,

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,367
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HER LOOK
IS AS STRONG AS MINE,

25
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:14,834
AND IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO GET TO ME.

26
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:18,533
- LAGANJA IS AN EXTREMELY
EMOTIONAL PERSON,

27
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:21,066
AND THAT'S GOING TO PLAY A TOLL
ON HER IN THE COMPETITION.

28
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,734
I THINK SHE'S JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HER FEELINGS

29
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,900
JUST AS MUCH
AS I DO, TOO.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,934
- UM...WELL, MOST OF THE GIRLS--
I HAD ALREADY SHARED THIS

31
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,266
IN "UNTUCKED."

32
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:35,734
BUT I WANT TO TAKE
THE TIME OUT TO TELL EVERYBODY

33
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:39,500
AUGUST OF 2012, I WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH H.I.V.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,500
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT
WITH EVERYBODY IN HERE

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,433
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE
AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE

36
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:49,500
IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY
WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH THIS

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,533
AND THEY'RE SCARED
TO SAY SOMETHING.

38
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,333
AND I NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S OK.

39
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,533
- I THINK ALL OF US THINK
THAT IS SO NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS.

WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, GIRL.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
- I THINK IT'S A HUGE STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,567
FOR TRINITY
TO SPEAK HER MIND.

44
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,934
I WAS REALLY, REALLY
IMPRESSED WITH THAT.

45
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,533
I THINK THAT'S
REALLY COMMENDABLE.

46
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,967
I THINK IT'S AMAZING.
GOOD JOB.

47
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:15,266
- ON A LIGHTER NOTE,
CONGRATULATIONS, MISS DE LA!

00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,567

WIN TWO CHALLENGES?

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,734
- I WON A CHALLENGE.
YOU WON A CHALLENGE.

51
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,834
- I WON THE FIRST
CHALLENGE, TOO.

52
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,100
- OH, YOU DID? OH.
- I DID.

53
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,200
- I WASN'T THERE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,900
I THINK IT'S BETTER
NOT TO STRUT AROUND

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,734
AND BE LIKE A PEACOCK
WHEN YOU WIN.

56
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,066
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

57
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,266

SUCH AN INTROVERT

510

I'D BEEN THROUGH IT

511

WITH SOMEONE ELSE
BEFORE.

512
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,066

513
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,500
FOR A WHILE,
WHEN I MOVED TO NEW YORK,

514

I DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK TO HIM,
DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM,

515

WHAT REALLY WAS HAPPENING.

THROUGH EVERYONE ELSE

517

THAT HE WAS HIV-POSITIVE,

518
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:37,734
AND HE DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED
TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE

519
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,400
BECAUSE HE WAS
SO FULL OF SHAME.

520

AND THIS SICKNESS...

521

FOR HIM TO HANDLE.

- THE HIP-HOP WAS
SOMETHING THAT THREW YOU.

736
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,567
- YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.

737
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,934

[RU PAUL LAUGHING]

739
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,233

YOU WORKED IN GROUPS,

00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:48,800
BUT TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE
JUDGED INDIVIDUALLY.

RESTING ON PRETTY.

747
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,934
- THANK YOU.

748
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,100
- YOU MAY LEAVE
THE STAGE.

749
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,800
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.

750
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,133
LET'S START WITH
JOSLYN FOX.

751
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,000
- YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BIT BUSY.

752
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,200
- ALL THE LAYERS
ON TOP OF LAYERS,

753
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,333
IT JUST STARTS TO GET
A LITTLE MESSY FOR ME.

754
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,800
- I DO FEEL LIKE I TEND
TO OVERACCESSORIZE.

755
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,633
- I ALWAYS
LOVE IT MYSELF.

756
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,333
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO
PLEASE THESE BITCHES UP HERE,

757
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,600
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT TO...

758
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,066
- I THINK YOUR RAP WAS GREAT.
I LOVE "MOTHER-FISHER."

759
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,367
[LAUGHTER]

760
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:43,133
- YOU REALLY STEPPED UP,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

761
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,100
- HA HA. THANK YOU.

762
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,967
- ALL RIGHT. NEXT UP,
TRINITY K. BONET-NET.

763
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,500
HEY, GIRL.

764
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,433
- YOU GIVE ME
NAOMI CAMPBELL DOWN.

765
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,834
- NOW LET'S MOVE
TO THE RAP.

766
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,033
THE LOOK WAS
REALLY SPOT-ON.

767
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,867
IT WAS SALT-N-PEPA
MEETS ANITA BAKER.

768
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,767
BUT YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.

769
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,000
- YOU FREAKED YOURSELF OUT.

770
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,066
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THE QUEEN TO MAKE EXCUSES,

771
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:06,200
BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO.

772
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,233
I LIP-SYNC FOR A LIVING.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

773
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:11,433
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, TRINITY.

774
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,867
NEXT UP, MILK.

775
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,000
- THE RAP WASN'T
ON BEAT,

776
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,533
BUT IT WAS YOUR OWN
PERSONALIZED UNIQUENESS.

777
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,433
YOU JUST WENT INTO
THIS LITTLE FUNNY...

778
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,667
YEAH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT WAS JUST SO YOU.

779
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,700
- THE CLOTHES WERE
WAY OFF FOR ME.

780
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,233
YOU HAD, LIKE, JOEY BUTTAFUOCO
ZUBAZ PANTS ON.

781
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,567
NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIP-HOP.

782
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,300
LOTS TO DO WITH THE BOYS I USED
TO HAVE SEX WITH AT THE GYM.

783
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,

784
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU
WITH PRETTY MAKEUP ON.

785
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,200
BUT I WOULDN'T EVER TURN AROUND
IN THAT SKIRT AGAIN.

786
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,400
- IT LOOKS LIKE BED SHEETS
WRAPPED AROUND YOU,

787
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,567
PINNED IN THE BACK.

788
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,567
THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
NEEDS TO BE JUST AS ON POINT

789
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,333
AS WHEN YOU COME OUT HERE
WITH A PINOCCHIO NOSE.

790
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,734
- ALL RIGHT.
DARIENNE LAKE.

791
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:52,834
- WELL, DARIENNE, PRETTY DRESS.
IT'S NOTHING SPECTACULAR.

792
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,100
- YESTERDAY,
WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE,

793
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,600
YOU GAVE ME, LIKE, MISSY ELLIOTT
WITH THE TRASH BAG.

794
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,333
I WANTED TO SEE YOU,
LIKE, BUST OUT OF IT

795
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,867
AND, LIKE, JUST REALLY
GIVE IT TO US,

796
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,166
BUT YOU WERE
A LITTLE WITHHELD.

797
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,800
- I THINK THE HIP-HOP
THREW YOU A LITTLE BIT.

798
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,233
- NEXT UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO.

799
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,333
- THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL I'VE SEEN YOU YET.

800
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,066
YOUR EYE MAKEUP--

801
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,133
YOU DIDN'T PUT
THAT HARSH WHITE LINE.

802
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,700
- I DIDN'T PUT IT,
BUT I DID SNORT IT.

803
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,867
- AT LEAST IT WAS USED.

804
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,000
- THAT'S WHY
I'M ALERT, GIRL.

805
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,667
- YESTERDAY,
YOU WERE HILARIOUS.

806
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,834
- OTHER THAN
THE PIGTAILS, THOUGH,

807
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,567
YOU WERE GIVING ME
KIND OF URKEL.

808
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,934
- I DISAGREE,
BECAUSE AS B-GIRLS,

809
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,400
THAT WAS THE LOOK
THAT WE ROCKED.

810
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,667
- AND LET ME
REMIND EVERYBODY

811
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,400
THAT MICHELLE VISAGE
IS ALSO A RAPPER.

812
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,433
SHE HAD A SONG
ON THE "BODYGUARD" SOUNDTRACK.

813
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,066
- TRACK 9. GO ON.

814
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,533
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
ADORE DELANO.

815
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:44,200
- WELL, ADORE, I'M HAPPY TO SEE
THAT YOU HAVE A WAIST.

816
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
- BUT?

817
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,433
- BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

818
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,500
ABOUT THIS KIND OF
MID-SHIN LENGTH?

819
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,400
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,

820
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,667
AND I WANTED
TO SHOW MY BODY.

821
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,633
[LAUGHTER]

822
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,834
- YOU ASSASSINATED THE RAP.
YOU'RE ON RHYTHM.

823
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,934
YOU WERE LIKE
JUST A REAL ARTIST.

824
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:05,000
- YOUR LYRICS WERE GREAT.
YOUR ATTITUDE WAS EVERYTHING.

825
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,233
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, YEAH.

826
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:08,233
[LAUGHTER]

827
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,567
- WELL, THANK YOU, LADIES.

828
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,233
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,

829
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,400
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

830
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,066
[ENGINE REVVING]

831
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:19,333
ALL RIGHT. NOW, JUST BETWEEN
US FREAKNIKS,

832
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:23,367
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
STARTING WITH JOSLYN FOX?

833
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:26,433
- HER RUNWAY LOOK TONIGHT
WAS JUST A DISASTER.

834
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,233
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD
HAVE THAT MUCH ON AND STILL--

835
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,400
- BE THAT NAKED?
[LAUGHTER]

836
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,900
I THINK SHE NAILED
THE VIDEO.

837

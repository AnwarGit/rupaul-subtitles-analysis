no matter which way the light hits me,
I'm gonna throw shade somewhere.

128
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,845
But, in all serious... You know,

129
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:17,416
when I was growing up, I came
from a very Southern, very practical,

130
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,554
church-going family, so I was
never encouraged to speak my mind

131
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,255
or ask questions.

132
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,790
Drag gave me my voice.

133
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,428
So I'm finally not afraid
to ask questions and say what I feel.

134
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,100
I know, girl, that I do come off
a little bit abrasive sometimes,

135
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,037
but it all comes
from a place of love. That's it.

136
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,806
All right. Good.

137
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:46,312

some questions from your fans.

140
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:59,525
{\an8}Well, it is time for a big girl to win,
but I don't want to win because I'm big,

141
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,864
but because I came in with guns a-blazing,
and I killed the competition.

142

00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,620
makes me feel like I failed as a father.

155
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,157
There's no way
that I don't approve of you.

156
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,427
Hopefully, tonight,
we can start two new chapters.

157
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,797
One, you winning everything
and going on to your fame and fortune,

158
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,833
something that you've worked...

159
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,536
[exhales deeply]

160
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,005
...you've worked very hard for.

161
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,044
And hopefully, we can start
another chapter, you and I, 

162
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:30,716
and we can move on and bond together
from here forward. Sorry.

163
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,285
Nobody knows how hard he's worked.

164
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,088
He's very special.

165
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,359
Good luck tonight. I'm so proud of you.
And we'll definitely be watching.

166
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,062
[cheers and applause]

167
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,771
What does it feel like
to hear your father say those words?

168
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,508
{\an8}Other than my mom,
I never felt loved growing up.

169
00:12:55,574 --> 00:13:00,679
{\an8}And I hope that this does lead to...

170
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,315
not only reconciliation, but...

171
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,819
a relationship that I never had.

172
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,155
[cheers and applause]

173
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,928
And I hope he feels bad enough
to buy me new bottom lashes

174
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,863
'cause these were custom.

175
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,168
So what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?

176
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,405
Oh, God. Who doesn't want
to be part of that legacy?

177
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,242
I mean, you've created something
that's so special for all of us.

178
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:35,247
And to even be considered
to be part of that is overwhelming.

179
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,519
Ginger, you are my kind
of plus-size queen.

180
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:45,825
You've got a big talent, a big heart,
and a big future ahead of you.

181
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,726
-I love you, Ginger.
-I love you too.

182
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,328
We all love the minj.

183
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,873
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

184
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,877
The final face-off
between our top three queens continues.

185
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:10,983
She started out as a sleeping beauty,
but will her fairy tale end with a crown?

186
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,753

-Good morning, Pearl.
-Good morning.

202
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,255
It's time to hear from the judges.
Michelle, what do you have to say?

203
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,558
You came into this competition,
you had a bit of an attitude,

204
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,063
but as time went on,
you became lovable, you became awake,

205
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,665
and you earned
your spot here in the final.

206
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,637
-You had to come out of your shell...
-Oh, look at you.

207
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,873
-Don't you love...
-Like a pearl, pearl in a shell.

208
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:21,880
But I think the audience has spoken,
and the people like you. They really do.

209
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,050
Congratulations.

210
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,256
You've come a long way, baby.
Let's take a look.

211
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:39,798
{\an8}'Sup? I would describe Pearl
as a robotic Stepford wife bitch.

212
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:46,805
<i>I've been drawing Pearl since I was ten.</i>
<i>Then one day, I just painted her on me.</i>

213
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,241
You've been sleepwalking.

214
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,076
Wake up, Pearl.

215
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,748
Wake up.

216
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,751
You kind of, like,
told me I had no personality.

217
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,221
Well, I'm hoping
it will light a fire under your ass.

218
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,827
-Do I have something on my face?
-Ah!

219
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,364
I had a rough childhood, okay?
I wasn't watching <i>Batman and Robin.</i>

220
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,402
[Michelle] <i>Someone set</i>
<i>their alarm clock and woke up.</i>

221
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,138
[RuPaul] <i>Well,</i> flazéda<i>.</i>

222
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
-<i>You're a weirdo.</i>
-[Pearl] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

223
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,209
[RuPaul] <i>Boy, have you changed.</i>

224
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,945
Now, there's nothing
that could break my spirit.

225
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,715
Attagirl, Pearl.

226
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,617
[cheers and applause]

227
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,123
-So, Pearl, what made you wake up?
-You said something a long time ago.

228
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,061
It was like, "The fear of looking
stupid is really holding you back,"

229
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:47,166
and, yeah, I mean, I'm not a quitter.
And I wasn't about to quit on <i>Drag Race</i>.

230
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,101
Good, I'm glad you didn't.

231
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,706
Have you heard of this conspiracy theory
called the Curse of Pearl,

232
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,244
where any queen who crosses you
immediately goes home?

233
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,914
Yeah, it's been brought up.
You didn't go home though.

234
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,816
Uh, bitch...

235
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,453
The thing is, I actually...
I didn't cross you.

236
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,289
I almost just threw your ass
out of the door.

237
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:21,133
{\an8}Take a look at this.
Which queen has least impressed you?

238
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,068
I'd have to say Pearl.

239
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,738
[RuPaul] Sasha Belle, sashay away.

240
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,577
I noticed this black trim around her chin.
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"

241
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,247
[RuPaul] Jasmine, girl, sashay away.

242
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,051
There is this part of Pearl
that is too cool for season seven.

243
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,955
[RuPaul] Sashay away.

244
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,325
I can forgive her, but I'll never forget.

245
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,029
[RuPaul laughs]

246
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,566
-We have some questions from some fans.
-Oh.

247
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,835
Oh, look who's here. It's Alaska.

248
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,804
{\an8}Hi!

249
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,706
Hi!

250
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,673
'Sup?

251
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,947
Xavier from California wants to know:

252
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,822
"Pearl, is it just me,
or does everybody want to fuck you?"

253
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,296
I'm single. Single.

254
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,801
How do you deal
with the attention you've gotten?

255
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,971
I want people to like me
because I'm talented and I'm unique

256
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,674
and I have nerve,
and I have, you know, charisma,

257
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,845
or... not in that order. But thank you.

258
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,681
[RuPaul] Now,

259
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,251
you have a lot of people
in your corner. Let's take a look.

260
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,355
I have something on my face,
and it's a big smile of love,

261
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,625
pride, and joy
for my number-one grandson.

262
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,562
-Love you, Matty. From your grandma.
-Ah!

263
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,932
Hey, Pearl.
Chicago family sends you love.

264
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,335
-You've slayed all season.
-You've been killing it. We love you.

265
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,270
Come on, chin strap!

266
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,540
-We're so proud of you.
-So proud.

267
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,110
-We wish you all the luck in the world.
-We love you.

268
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,147
-Love you so much.
-Love you. More than anything.

269
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:20,219
I wanted to send you a quick message
letting you know how proud I am of you.

270
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,155
You have always been a special...

271
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,857
special little boy,

272
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:30,963
from the time you were two and three,
running around in your sister's tutu,

273
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,434
to the time that I knew
I was going to lose you to a big city.

274
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,439
I knew one thing would never change,
and that is my love for you.

275
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,775
I love you as my son.
I love you as Pearl.

276
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,345
And we could not be more proud of you.

277
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,882
And I am so happy
to have watched you go through this.

278
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,619
I love you, and we'll see you soon.

279
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,492
[cheers and applause]

280
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,430
Pearl, your mother is here.
I want to say hi to the mother of Pearl.

281
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,400
{\an8}-Hello, mother of Pearl.
-Hello, Ru.

282
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:14,873
{\an8}Now, you've gone over and above
for your support of Pearl. Tell us more.

283
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,976
One day, I thought,
"I should do a fan page."

284
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:23,015
Within just a few hours,
I was literally inundated

285
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:28,987
with private messaging
from younger gay boys, um...

286
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,455
Looking for sex.

287
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,398
-No, that's... that's <i>my</i> fan page.
-No, that's your fan page, right.

288
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,967
[Pearl's mother] I was messaged
by so many people.

289
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,971
"How do I come out to my parents?"
It's been pretty amazing.

290
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,640
That's fabulous. That's wonderful.

291
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:53,312
So, Pearl, what would you do
with $100,000?

292
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:59,484
Maybe buy some nice wigs after seeing
myself in thirsty-ass wigs all season.

293
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
Now, one final question:

294
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,691
do I have something on my face?

295
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,132
The answer is yes.
And it's a mixture of pride,

296
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,769
affection, and about
two and a half inches of foundation.

297
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,373
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Pearl.

298
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,717
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

299

320

[RuPaul] Come through, mama!

321
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:39,010
Okay, Violet, let's talk to the judges,
starting with... I hate Michelle Visage.

322
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:46,852
You can hate me all you want.
I loves me some Violet Chachki.

323
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,325
What's so impressive about you
is you have beautiful clothes,

324
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,727
but you wear the clothes,
they don't wear you.

325
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,463
You really present yourself.

326
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,531
Thank you.

327
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,467
Every week,
I've been on the edge of my seat

328
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,103
waiting for you to electrify me
with your looks.

329
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,207
And tonight, though, you electrified me
with your performance, honey.

330
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,711
-[Ross] You earned it.
-Thank you.

331
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,214
Thank you, judges.
Now, Violet Chachki, since day one,

332
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,083
you wowed us with your runway,

333
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,453
but this competition
has not always been a cinch for you.

334
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,188
Let's take a look.

335
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,957
{\an8}I'm a one-of-a-kind collectible.

336
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,992
{\an8}Party.

337
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,097
{\an8}<i>My biggest strength is aesthetics.</i>
<i>I'm very visually appealing.</i>

338
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:32,931
Is that conceited?

339
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:37,402
[RuPaul] <i>You took fashion risks,</i>
<i>and they paid off.</i>

340
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,742
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you tartan eleganza.</i>
<i>I'm giving you 1956 Dior.</i>

341
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,846
<i>I'm giving you John Willie</i>
<i>vintage smut for your nerves.</i>

342
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,349
You might have been playing
a dead person, but we were living.

343
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,053
Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of bitchy.

344
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,089
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, boo-boo.

345
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,426
They think I'm mean, but all I've done

346
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,129
either comes from a place of humor
or a place of truth.

347
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,831
The biggest thing
that I've learned in this process

348
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,268
<i>is to just be aware</i>
<i>of your first impressions.</i>

349
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:15,440
<i>I represent the past, the present,</i>
<i>but more than anything, the future.</i>

350
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,385
So when did you start
designing your own clothes?

351
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,855
I think I started sewing
around, like, eighth grade.

352
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,224
Skinny jeans were just becoming a thing,

353
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,926
and they didn't have them
in boys' clothes.

354
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,496
And I also tailored
my Catholic school uniform.

355
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,232
-You went to Catholic school?
-K through 12.

356
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:47,072
I would do alterations mostly, so I think
at 12 or 13, I got a sewing machine.

357
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,007
Where'd all this confidence come from?

358
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:54,312
I got to a point in my life where I was
sick of dealing with other people's...

359
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,914
What they wanted me to do.

360
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:00,085
I said, "You know what? I'm gonna
live my life for me, and that's it."

361
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,625
We have some fan questions.
Are you ready?

362
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,994
-Yeah, let's do it.
-All right, there is Gia Gunn.

363
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,664
{\an8}[Violet] Hi, Gia Gunn.

364
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:16,568
From Skylar from California:

365
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:22,574
"Violet, what would you tell a teenager
who wants to do drag

366
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,379
but is afraid of how their family
and friends will react?"

367
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:32,484
What I did is, I would do drag
in the middle of the night in my bedroom.

368
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,522
Eventually, I went out, snuck around,
just do it in secret until it became okay

369
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,126
and I became comfortable to do it
and be proud of it.

370
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,863
-Oh, that's good advice.
-Absolutely. I think that's wonderful.

371
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,532
Thank you, Gia.
Do we have another question?

372
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,301
-Hi.
-Hi, Mimi.

373
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,204
{\an8}Okay, Violet Chachki,

374
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:58,777
{\an8}you were voted
the shadiest queen by the other girls.

375
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:05,717
Chris from San Diego wants to know:
"Who did you vote for and why?"

376
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,420
I think I voted for myself, actually.

377
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,423
I'm honest.

378
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,595
If you can't hate yourself, how the hell
are you going to hate somebody else?

379
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,202
There you have it. It's time to hear
from some of your biggest supporters.

380
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,305
-Let's take a look.
-I'm Team Violet because she is sickening.

381
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,973
Team Violet for the win!

382
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,545
Yes, bitch! Fuck it up!
Slay! Come through!

383
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,280
<i>Hi, Violet, mom here.</i>

384
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,683
I just wanted to say congratulations
for making it to the finals.

385
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,588
I am so proud
of the way you have handled yourself.

386
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,824
We wanted to let you know
how proud we are.

387
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,126
We never doubted
you'd make it to the finals.

388
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,463
Now the world knows it too.
We're proud to be your friends.

389
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,332
-Now make them bitches eat it.
-We love you.

390
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,803
Hi, Violet, your dad here. I would like
to wish you all the success in the world.

391
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,641
I am proud of the level of accomplishment
you've achieved doing what you love to do.

392
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,379
I hope to see you go all the way
to the top. Good luck. We love you.

393
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,118
{\an8}Your mother, Alex, is here.

394
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:19,624
{\an8}What advice do you have for parents
with children as flamboyant as Violet?

395
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,294
As a parent, you have to let them
be their own person.

396
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,864
-That's all you can do.
-[RuPaul] Right.

397
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,702
That's good advice. Thanks, Alex.

398
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,406
Now, Violet, what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?

399
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,943
It would mean everything.
This is it. This is what I love to do.

400
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,282
I have such a passion for it.
It gives me life. It's everything to me.

401
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,586
It brings me so much happiness and joy.
In whatever mood I'm in,

402
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:54,092
I can watch a bitch like Kennedy twirl
and just get so happy watching it.

403
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,030
It moves me. I love it so much.
And it would mean the world to me.

404
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:04,302
Well, Violet Chachki, you are not
just a one-of-a-kind collectible.

405
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,105
You are a treasure.
Ladies and gentlemen, Violet Chachki.

406
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,816
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

407
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,819
Now, while the top three
are backstage getting ready,

408
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:25,590
it's time to catch up with the queens
that made this season sickening.

409
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:32,630
Starting with a drag dad, a code cracker,
a corn popper, and a very married lady.

410
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,200
{\an8}Mama's home. Ah!

411
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,235
{\an8}[laughter]

412
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:42,740
{\an8}My drag style is influenced
by campy and kitschy people of the world.

413
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,843
[Kandy] So how old are you?

414
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,514
-Oh! How old am I? Really?
-How old?

415
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,351
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle.
Say hello to my little friends!

416
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,422
{\an8}<i>I can tell you every episode,</i>
<i>what the challenge was, who went home.</i>

417
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,990
I've cracked the code.

418
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,426
<i>We'll never pick up</i>
<i>hot men looking like this.</i>

419
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,863
<i>I'm the next drag superstar</i>
<i>because I've done my homework.</i>

420
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,898
{\an8}-We made it, bitches!
-Yes!

421
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,467
{\an8}<i>Jasmine is class and elegance.</i>

422
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,404
{\an8}I am here. H-E-R-E, bitch. I'm here.

423
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,106
Where did you get a loaf of bread?

424
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,143
[Jasmine] <i>No tea, no shade,</i>
<i>no pink lemonade.</i>

425
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,178
Ding!

426
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,248
{\an8}Hi, my honeys. I'm home.

427
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,751
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis.

428
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,255
-[RuPaul] Is that Joan Rivers?
-What are you wearing?

429
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,157
[Kasha] <i>Anybody can be a girl,</i>
<i>but it takes balls to be a lady.</i>

430
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,694
There's always time for a cocktail.

431
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:46,170
Tempest DuJour, Kandy Ho accused you
of being too old. How did you feel?

432
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,141
Well, it never feels good,
but Kandy and I are friends.

433
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,778
I wish that, you know, at my age,
she looks half as fabulous as I do.

434
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,248
I'm sorry for calling you old.

435
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,517
-Apology accepted.
-My mom taught me better.

436
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,153
To be nice to old people.

437
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,326
-I love you, girl. I love you so much.
-I love you, too, I really do.

438
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,898
You also have an eight-year-old
and a five-year-old at home.

439
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,466
-Correct.
-Did they watch?

440
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,603
They did.
My daughter watched the first episode.

441
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,138
She cried when I got eliminated.

442
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,574
She said, "Papa, why doesn't
RuPaul like you anymore?"

443
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,316
Mimi, if you're watching,
RuPaul loves your daddy. Now, go to bed!

444
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,653
Next up, we've got Sasha Belle.

445
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:43,227
You arrived thinking that you had cracked
the code. What happened?

446
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:49,534
I thought that I did crack the code.
I thought I knew what you wanted,

447
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,038
but I think what makes the show so great
is that it's so different every season.

448
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,408
-And I wasn't ready.
-All right.

449
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:02,213
Now, back in Iowa, you host a night
called "Sasha Belle's Drag Race,"

450
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,449
-is that right?
-Yes, yes.

451
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,919
First of all, you'll be hearing
from my lawyers.

452
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:14,192
And, second of all, how is that going?

453
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:22,567
It's going really good. We do it
because I really fucking love this show.

454
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,735
I do.

455
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,471
If there was no grand prize,
I would still play.

456
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,773
You keep ringing them bells.

457
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,775
All right. Thank you.

458
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,846
-Up next, Jasmine Masters.
-Oh, my God.

459
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,219
What was your most exciting moment
on the drag race?

460
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,254
-Meeting Kennedy.
-Really?

461
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,592
Yeah. Because I have watched her
at least nine years, ten years

462
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,996
on VCR tapes doing pageants
and dancing and stuff.

463
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,968
And... I'm sorry if I snitch
on your age, girl. Forgive me, girl.

464
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,174
-Jasmine, who inspired you to do drag?
-Patti LaBelle.

465
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:08,446
She who she is when she on stage,
when she off stage. She gives 1,000%.

466
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:12,650
-I just love her. She's everything to me.
-Well, we have a surprise for you.

467
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,385
-Take a look.
-What?

468
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,356
Hi, Jasmine.
I love the way you stirred it up, honey.

469
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,893
Thank you for always looking
like Patti LaBelle at my concerts.

470
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,761
I love you. Bye.

471
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,597
Are you serious, Ru?
You did that for me?

472
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,867
[RuPaul] Yeah.

473
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,973
Yes. Yep.

474
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,710
Well, I felt like we needed
to lift you up even more,

475
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,214
because on social media,
people were very harsh to you.

476
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,483
-How did that make you feel?
-When you...

477
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,420
...are getting so much negativity,
it's like you can't breathe.

478
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,924
And it took me back to a friend of mine
who had committed suicide

479
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,560
when they were bullied so much
being young and gay.

480
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,894
Their parents put them out.

481
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,497
The straight and the gay world
didn't accept them,

482
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:04,735
so they just ended it 'cause they didn't
feel like they belong. That's how I felt.

483
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,370
-Well...
-So it was hard,

484
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,440
but I just ate a lot of food
and a lot of hot sauce, and...

485
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,514
[RuPaul] I'm glad you did get through it,
and I'm glad you're here.

486
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:22,386
For seven years, our show has been one
of the most popular ones on social media.

487
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:27,258
But recently, there's been a shift
with more and more comments

488
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,863
having a darker tone.
But like my mama always said,

489
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,134
"Unless them bitches is paying your bills,
you pay them bitches no mind."

490
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:47,345
All right, next up, there's always time
for a cocktail and Mrs. Kasha Davis.

491
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,817
During the competition, you had
some issues with some of the younger kids.

492
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,886
What were they?

493
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:59,023
Some of the young gals on the show
just had sort of a sense of entitlement.

494
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,827
It gets a little grating in that respect,
where somebody, you know,

495
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,329
"I've been doing this
for seven months. I will win."

496
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,964
And they might. So, um...

497
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,072
But I learned a lot from these girls.

498
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:19,610
Trixie taught me how to put
way too much makeup on.

499
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:24,215
And I'm wearing
two of Violet's corsets right here.

500
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:31,022
I've always wanted to ask you,
is there really a Mr. Kasha Davis?

501
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,357
-There is.
-[RuPaul] Where is he?

502
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,793
{\an8}-Right here in the...
-[RuPaul] That's him?

503
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,796
{\an8}-[Kasha] That's Mr. Davis.
-[RuPaul] Hi, Mr. Kasha Davis.

504
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,665
-He's cute.
-He's cute.

505
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,367
Get ready, Mr. Davis,
'cause mama's coming home.

506
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,208

507

Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

As our top three prepare backstage
for the crowning of our next superstar,

these four queens are the perfect balance
of sugar, spice, and everything nice.

510
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,426
Oh, and, um, chickens too. Take a look.

511
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,365
{\an8}I hope you girls got a sweet tooth, 
because Kandy's in the fucking house.

{\an8}<i>Because I am what? Fierce.</i>

522
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,198
Work that puss.

523
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,234
I have not officially come out
to my family yet.

524
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,271
I think it may change my relationship,

525
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,772
and that's what I'm scared of most.

526

<i>magazines, beyond-this-planet beautiful. </i>

527
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:05,383
Should I not talk about my feelings,
or should I just keep moving on?

528
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,385
My God. I feel like I'm dating you.

529
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,586
How's your head?

530
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,054
How is your head?

531
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,555
How's your head?

532
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,658
Fine.

533

[clucking]

534
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,799
That's how I talk to chickens.

535
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:30,308
Kandy Ho, I hear that you are thinking
about leaving Puerto Rico?

536
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,109
-I am.
-<i>Escándalo</i>!

537
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>Ay, sí.</i>

538
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,747
I love Puerto Rico,
and I've been there since I was ten,

539
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,349
-but...
-Where were you before?

540
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,650
Connecticut.

541
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,824
[Max] You're a liar!

542
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,629
-I guess I'm a fake Puerto Rican, right?
-Okay, all right.

543
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:56,200
-What would you have done differently?
-I wouldn't have painted on a beard.

544
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,836
I looked like a Neapolitan ice cream.

545
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,307
-Do you do your own makeup?
-I started doing it

546
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,010
a month before auditioning for the show.

547
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,014
In Puerto Rico, we just go up
to our fabulous makeup artists, like,

548
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,384
"Paint me and do my hair
and dress me up, and I'm gone."

549
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,087
-Yeah.
-It's, like, my mistake. Sorry.

550
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,291
Yeah. Kandy, my dear,
you are one of my favorite hos, and...

551
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,595
That's saying a lot,
because I know a lot of hos.

552
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:30,234
Next, the silver fox of season seven, Max.

553
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:35,973
Yes. Now, this season,
when the queens were talking about sex,

554
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,576
you weren't having it at all.
You were like...

555
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:43,047
Listen, these girls, they don't talk
about anything else besides sex.

556
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,383
But I was tired of it. Just for a moment.

557
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,384
-Okay.
-I'm not...

558
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,953
I'm not that big of a prude,
honest to goodness.

559
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:54,525
You coached Jaidynn and Pearl
through a few tense moments.

560
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:55,726
Tell us about that.

561
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,230
Well, Jaidynn is an actress.
She is a performer.

562
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:03,367
For her to say, "I'm not," that was
nerves, so we had to calm down.

563
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:07,338
Pearl had to calm down, we had to regroup,
and then we had to go kill it.

564
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,640
-Yeah.
-I love it. That's great.

565
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,442
That's great advice.

566
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:16,213
Well, Max, when it comes to my feelings
for you, there are no gray areas.

567
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,649
Thank you.

568
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,255
Up next, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.

569
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,661
What surprised you the most
about being on the show?

570
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:35,166
Um, well, I didn't think
we were gonna be locked up so much.

571
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,034
-Child.
-You're sequestered.

572
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,439
And that was... I was imagining myself
going out to dinner with you, darling.

573
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,074
-Yeah.
-I thought we'd go to Hollywood Boulevard.

574
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,443
Get some munchies,

575
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,547
some cauliflower, corn bread,
green beans, a turkey.

576
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,285
And I wasn't able to do that.
I was sitting in my hotel room,

577
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:59,690
-beating myself up and eating Doritos.
-That's different from your normal life?

578
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,632
You revealed that your mother
and your brother knew that you did drag.

579
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,268
-Yes.
-But they didn't know that you're gay.

580
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,369
-Right.
-And now?

581
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,139
-Where is that right now?
-Well, I think it was...

582
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:20,311
she didn't want me to be that way.
I don't think they understand,

583
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,415
-you know, fully, who a gay person is.
-Well, that's funny,

584
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,384
because we have a little surprise for you.
Take a look at this.

585
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,688
Surprise, surprise!

586
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:37,828
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.
You had some concerns.

587
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:44,034
I've experienced rejection in my life,
so it's very hard for me to reject mine,

588
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:49,006
because I know how hurtful
and painful rejection is.

589
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,009
<i>You know, this is not a battle,</i>
<i>it's just...</i>

590
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:57,214
one thing that we're just gonna learn
to just go ahead and do what we do,

591
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,216
and that's love one another.

592
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:05,022
My love is not based on what you do.
My love is based on who you are.

593
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,859
And you're my precious,
handsome Christopher.

594
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,637
What are you feeling right now?

595
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:24,909
I feel like my family is now gonna be able
to get to know who I really am,

596
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,245
after 26 years of my life.

597
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:36,253
If I don't get anything else, I got
the peace and the freedom to be who I am

598
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,989
around my family, and to be happy.

599
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,929
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>, still bringing
families together. Hallelu.

600
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,398
All right.

601
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,535
Up next, Miss Fame, girl, hey.

602
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,804
Hi.

603
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,978
-By the way, how's your head?
-Well, there have been a few complaints.

604
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,680
[Miss Fame] What?

605
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,916
You and Katya came clean

606
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,418
-about being sober.
-Right.

607
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,387
-And what's the reaction been?
-You know what,

608
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,323
I've had so many people write me

609
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,026
personal stories about how much time
they had, how inspiring it was.

610
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,764
It's just a dream come true
to be able to walk through

611
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,068
the obstacle of addiction
and be able to...

612
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,103
live your life.

613
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:36,780
Miss Fame, all season long, you served
fierce couture, gorgeous fashions,

614
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,683
and people only want
to talk to you about chickens.

615
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,186
I'm not mad about it.
At least they're talking to me.

616
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,287
[RuPaul] Yeah.

617
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,056
I grew up on a farm
with the chickens, so...

618
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,992
Can you talk a little chicken?

619
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:51,195
-Can you do that?
-I can, but I think it's best I have...

620
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,298
a special guest come out
to help me do that.

621
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,600
-Is Colonel Sanders here?
-Hold on one moment.

622
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,005
Colonel Sanders? I thought he was dead.

623
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,411
-Oh, my God, you fucking bitch!
-Gorgeous!

624
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,947
She's got bigger hair than me tonight.

625
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,851
-Do you do tricks with it?
-I'm afraid of it shitting on my couture.

626
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,252
Oh, dear.

627
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,592
Miss Fame, whether in fashion or poultry,
you have a bright future ahead of you.

628
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,895
-Just don't cluck it up, okay?
-I promise I won't!

629
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:25,896
[RuPaul] Okay.

630
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,970
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

631
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:38,542
We are moments away from finding out
if Ginger, Pearl or Violet Chachki

632
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,378
will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.

633
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,081
But first, some fierce contenders

634
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:49,019
that gave our top three a real run
for their money. Let's take a look.

635
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,755
{\an8}This isn't Maury Povich.

638
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,931
If you're gonna be the comedy queen,
you gotta go all the way.

639
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,233
You right, girl, you right.

00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,141

-So, Trixie Mattel.
-Hi, Ru.

659
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:11,135
When you first left, the internet
went cray cray. What was that like?

660
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:15,172
I felt very supported and loved.
I felt like less of a loser.

661
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,942
-Well, losing is the new winning.
-Yes!

662
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,211
What's your life been like

Oh, my gosh.

664
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,349
If I never get a chance again,
I have to thank you, because...

665
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,287
you reached into my little blond,
pink life and changed it so much.

666
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,655
[cheers and applause]

667
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,461
I'm glad you got to experience this.

668
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,064
Now, I hear you do
a mean RuPaul impersonation.

669
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,266
I could never.

670
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,136
-Let me hear it.
-Okay.

671
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,973
-Yeah.
-Trixie, on the runway you're a doll,

672
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,510
but your comedy seems manufactured.

673
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,583
-Are you mad?
-Sashay away.

674
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,088
Three times! Three times!

675
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,459
Next up, Katya!

676
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:22,506
Katya, all season long, you were
plagued with doubt. What was going on?

677
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:26,343
-I was terrified the whole fucking time.
-Really?

678
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,215
RuPaul, you are sitting there, I see you,

679
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:35,252
-but I want to tackle you to the ground.
-Uh-huh. Yeah?

680
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,955
I want to stuff your entire wig
inside my mouth...

681
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,256
[RuPaul] Okay, yeah.

682
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,025
-And I want you to pee on me.
-Okay.

683
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,596
-Yeah.
-And listen.

684
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,332
The first time you came over
to me, I was, like,

685
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,133
waiting my whole life for this.

686
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,802
-Sure.
-And... I don't know.

687
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:56,173
There's something in my brain
that said, "She wants to kill you."

688
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,144
And I... I know you don't want to...
I mean, I'm 98% sure at least.

689
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,680
Oh, no, I did want to kill you.

690
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,017
And then I just couldn't...
I don't know.

691
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,652
But now, having seen the show,

692
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,123
do you see that it's unfounded,
that you have no reason to doubt yourself?

693
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,524
Do you you were fabulous?

694
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,995
Watching the show has given me...
some self-esteem.

695
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,335
So thank you so much, Ru.

696
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,039
Katya, you are a freak. And...

697
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:33,477
-I freaking love you.
-Oh, my God.

698
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,114
[cheers and laughter]

699
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:42,819
All right, up next,
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.

700
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,327
Now, Kennedy, when I started
saying that, I had no idea

701
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:54,965
that you would actually
fly off the main stage.

702
00:48:55,032 --> 00:49:00,370
-Have you ever hurt between me down there?
-No, I mean, I'm a trained dancer.

703
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,606
-You mean "dahn-cer."
-"Dahn-sah."

704
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,774
[RuPaul] Yes.

705
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,178
So I did the necessary things to stretch,
to make sure that did not happen.

706
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,381
But there's more down there
that could get hurt.

707
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,350
Yeah, way more than Katya.

708
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,324
-It's true.
-Yeah.

709
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,558
[RuPaul] Yeah.

710
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,262
Throughout the season,
we joked about "the struggle is real."

711
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,897
It became one of your tag lines,

712
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,701
but in your family, in your background,
that's a reality.

713
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:36,073
I know that you recently reunited
with your mother after a long separation.

714
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:42,012
My mother's been in and out.
My dad got custody when I was two,

715
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,283
and my sister was two months.
And she would make me mad

716
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:50,253
because she said she'd come,
and she never did, and she was in and out.

717
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,690
-She was on her own journey.
-But she's here tonight with you,

718
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:54,691
-right?
-Yeah.

719
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:59,062
{\an8}[RuPaul] Chicory, are you there?
Is that Chicky right there? I love it.

720
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,331
{\an8}-Hey, Mama Chicory.
-Hi.

721
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:05,068
I am so glad you are here with us tonight.
Give her a big round of applause.

722
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:13,543
And on another note,
if you ever have the chance to get out

723
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,914
and see Miss Kennedy Davenport in concert,

724
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:22,819
live, it will give you life. Trust. Yes.

725
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,822
-Yes, it's true.
-Thank you.

00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,626
{\an8}Now it's time
for viewer questions. Who's first?

727
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:34,498
{\an8}-Hi! I have a question for Trixie...
-[RuPaul] Uh-huh.

728
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,034
{\an8}-From Sarah.
-Yeah.

729
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,104
"You and Max knew each other in college.

730
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:45,075
Did Max speak
with that fake-ass British accent then?"

732
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:55,285
I don't think so, but I've never been
to that area of Wisconsin.

733
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,521
-Maybe they talk that way.
-Yeah, that's true.

734
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,892
It's just an elocution thing, a diction
and an elocution thing, not an accent.

735
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:06,263
-What'd she say?
-She says it's elocution, not an accent.

736
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,998
-"Alacutia"?
-Uh-huh.

737
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,168
[RuPaul] Yeah.

738
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,503
-Is she from Inglewood?
-[RuPaul] Yes.

739
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,807
-I know her. I know her.
-I went to high school with her.

740
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,275
Yeah.

741
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:26,083
{\an8}-Well, Delta Work, you better work.
-I have a question from Amy in Boston.

742
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:31,555
"If there's an <i>All-Stars Two</i>, which queen
from season seven deserves to compete?"

743
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:37,360
Kennedy, who would you condone?
Nominate. Who would you nominate?

744
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,836
To be honest and to answer the question,
I really would choose Katya.

745

00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,701
I want to know, what has
this past year been like for you?

790
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:08,204
It's been absolutely unreal.
I've had this amazing journey.

I've been able to travel the world,
spread my hate, do my thing, I...

792
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:16,546
No, truly, I've been in Australia,
London, Amsterdam, Akron, Ohio.

793
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:20,250
Places I never expected to visit.
It's been unreal and amazing.

00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:26,056
I have to say that the opportunity
this lady has given me changed my life.

795
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,426
Therefore, I cannot thank you enough.
It's been amazing.

-So respect it.

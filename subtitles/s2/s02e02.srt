Rupaul's Drag Race...

00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:03,967
- Hey!

00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:05,934
[all screaming]

4
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,467
- Sahara and I have
been friends forever.

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,300
- I hope that I don't fall
into that role of babysitting

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,533
when I should be really, like,
cutting their bra straps.

7
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,500
- You must create
your best drag look

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,066
using just these curtains.

9
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,567
Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

10
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,333
You have a child?
- I do have a son.

11
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,433
My son is, like,
my major motivation

12
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:25,734
for winning this competition.

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,734
- All right!

14
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,734
She is throwing
some serious 'shay.

15
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:33,166
Morgan McMichaels, you are
the winner of this challenge.

16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,500
You will receive immunity.

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
- I don't fucking
like being just safe.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,667
- Mystique, based on your
unforgettable presentation,

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,100
I'm giving you
a get out of jail free card.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,300
Sahara Davenport, Shangela,

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,800
the time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.

22
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,133
- Ohh!

23
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,600
- Sahara Davenport,

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,934
Shante, you stay.

25
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:06,066
Shangela, sashay away.

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,800
<i>And tonight...</i>

-<i> And heads will turn.</i>

32
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,734
- I think we might be
in trouble.

33

- Help me.

[alarm clock beeping]

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,500
- Walking into the workroom
this morning

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,066
was a little weird 'cause we
didn't have Shangela with us.

51
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,300
- Sahara?

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,600
- Yes, darling?
- Here's Shangela's face.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,533
- Ohh!
What am I gonna do with it?

54
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,166
I'm trying to take the attitude
that it's a clean slate.

55
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,667
Trying not to have the weight
of what happened the other night

56
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,233
on my shoulders.

57
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,066
She's gone,
so we won't need this anymore.

58
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,166
This is now my station, guys.

<i>Okay?</i>

72
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:27,900
- Make it rain.

73

- Rain?

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,500
- Hey, girls.

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,667
[cheers and applause]

76
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,700
Now, today I'm gonna
give you a chance

77
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,333
to street walk
a mile in my shoes.

78
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:41,300
Oh, dear!

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Today's mini-challenge
is a makeover,

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,166
where you'll be turning
a lady into a tramp.

81
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,467
The lady in question is me.

82
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:55,533
[gasps and laughter]

83
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,900
Or, as I like to say, mini-Ru.

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,066
[laughter and applause]

85
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:05,333
Now, as you girls see, there are
only six supermodel dolls,

86
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,300
so you'll be working in pairs.

87
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,500
And there's
an odd number of you,

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,400
which means one person
will be working alone.

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,633
Now take a moment
to choose a partner.

90
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:17,800
- We'll do it together.

91
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,467
- The Atlanta girls
are working together?

92
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,600
- Let's do it?
- Hell, yeah.

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,166
- Raven and Morgan?
- New York!

94
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,600
- New York?
Okay, yeah.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,700
Tyra and Jujubee.

96
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Jessica and Tatianna.

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,533
- I'm alone.

98
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,867
- Mystique works alone.

99
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,867
- Always.

100
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:35,500
- Ladies, you'll have
30 minutes for your makeover.

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,467
Feel free to use the materials
we've provided.

102
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,200
Now, when I return,
I want to see

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,700
these little ladies turned
into six bad girls

104
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,066
that work hard for the money,

105
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,133
if you know what I mean.

106
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,100
Are you ready?

107
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,667
Set...
go.

108
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,467
- My number one goal was to grab
the whole plate of fabric.

109
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,367
- Tyra and I ended up
with most of the stuff.

110
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,667
- We had got what we wanted,

111
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,600
and then let everyone
get our sloppy seconds.

112
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,834
- We did not get left nothing.

113
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,367
I got, like,
one handful of scraps.

114
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,066
Oh, my God!

115
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,066
- 30 minutes, bitch.
- Okay.

116
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,500
- I think her heel
should be broken.

117
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,900
- [laughs] Definitely, yeah.
- What about these boots?

118
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,967
- I think she needs
hooker heels.

119
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,667
- But I seen hookers
out there with boots on.

120
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:24,433
- I love working with Tyra,
but sometimes he just kind of

121
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,233
wants to do
what Tyra wants to do.

122
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,734
- The purse should
match the shoes.

123
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:32,433
- No, it shouldn't match
the shoes, diva.

124
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,300
- These are not heels.
These are rhinestones.

125
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,767
- She's tucked real good.

126
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,066
[laughing]

127
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,800
I think what I'm gonna
miss most being here

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,734
and not in Atlanta is
the fact that I won't be able

129
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:43,066
to spend day-to-day time
with my son, Lucas,

130
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:45,400
who's 3 1/2, and I miss him.

131
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,567
We play every day.

132
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,100
- Hello, dolly.

133
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,266
- Uh-oh!
- Wow! [laughs]

134
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,934
- Where's the glitter?
Where's the glitter?

135
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,166
Where's the glitter?

136
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,967
- You use all my glitter.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

137
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,633
- You tramp.
- Work.

138
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,166
- Glue these shoes on.

139
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,967
- Okay, ladies, time's up.

140
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,567
It is time to reveal
your makeovers.

141
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,533
- I got Shaquanda here.

142
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,066
- Uh-huh.

143
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,400
I call her
a broke-down stripper.

144
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,133
When she want to be naughty,
all you got to do

145
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,900
is turn her around,
she's ready for access.

146
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
- Hey!

147
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,433
- With her nice little
rose tattoo.

148
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,734
- Tatianna and Jessica.

149
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,934
- This is both of us.

150
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,300
She's got my eyes, but her lips.

151
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,200
- What is this doll's name?

152
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,734
- Wild Whore.

153
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:27,667
- [laughing]

154
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,600
- Wild Whore.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,767
- Pandora and Sahara.

156
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,433
- Our girl is called
Shafreeforal.

157
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,667
She's had a little bit
of a rough night.

158
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,934
She has lost her shoe.

159
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:36,967
[RuPaul laughing]

160
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,166
- Her other heel is broken,

161
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,600
but she still has
the heel in her hand.

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,834
She hasn't lost it.
- It's her good shoe.

163
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,867
- Yes.

164
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:46,700
- Sonique
and Nicole Paige Brooks.

165
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,367
- Well, you said
it could be a bad girl,

166
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,266
so the baddest bitch we know
is my drag mother

167
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:53,266
Shawna Brooks,
so she's styled after her.

168
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,700
- Wow, look at that.

169
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,900
- Yes, with the matching boots,
and always one titty out.

170
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,734
- Tyra and Jujubee.

171
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:00,867
- This is Cherry.

172
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:01,867
- Oh, Cherry.

173
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:03,367
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, wow.

174
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,600
- And she has one tooth missin'.
- That's okay, girl.

175
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,433
Is that a skirt?
- Um, it's a skort.

176
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,166
- Look, she is dealin'
crack back here.

177
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,100
- More hair to comb,
more cheeks to powder.

178
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,500
That's all it is.
- That's right.

179
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,567
That's what we tell her.

180
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,333
- Morgan and Raven?

181
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,400
- This is Lady Mayhem
from the House of Chaos.

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,567
- Gorgeous,
look how cute that is.

183
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,333
- Just a little, tiny thong
with a nice sequined strap.

184
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,300
- All right, ladies,
that was quite the show.

185
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,367
The winning team is...

186
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,800
Pandora Boxx
and Sahara Davenport.

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
[applause]

188
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,433
Miss Shafreeforal.

189
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,200
- Shafreeforal won!

190
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,133
- Congratulations, girls.

191
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:52,166
Now, this week's
main stage challenge

192
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,767
is inspired by my feature film
<i>Starrbooty,</i>

193
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,200
where I play
an undercover hustler.

194
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,734
Word, holla, hey!

195
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:05,233
And a diva is a female version
of a hustler.

196
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,900
This is your chance to unleash
your inner pussycat doll

197
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,700
and to show us that you can use
your brains and your beauty

198
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,633
to make it rain.

199
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,367
In two teams,
you'll be competing

200
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,367
as burlesque dancers.

201
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,934
You'll be judged on your ability
to work as an individual

202
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,166
and in a group.

203
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,934
Pandora, Sahara, since you won
the mini-challenge,

204
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,867
you are team captains.

205
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,633
Pandora, who do you pick first?

206
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,834
- Uh, Morgan.

207
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,200
- Ooh, yay.

208
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
- Sahara?
- Jessica.

209
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,266
- Jessica!

210
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,266
- Sonique.

211
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,567
- Jujubee.

212
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,233
- Raven.

213
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,500
- They was going after the girls

214
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,800
who are skinny
and go out there naked.

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,767
I'm not all, "Oh, my God,
they didn't pick me,"

216
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:53,934
cry, cry, cry.

217
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,333
No, it's not my personality.

218
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,567
This ain't high school.

219
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,433
- Tyra.

220
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,467
- Tyra?

221
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,734
- I wanted to be
in Pandora's group.

222
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,667
She had all the tall,
skinny, pretty bitches.

223
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:06,700
- Tatianna.

224
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,867
- Tatianna!

225
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,233
[applause]

226
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,166
Sahara, your choice.

227
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,633
- We're gonna go with Mystique.

228
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,967
- It's all about the titties.

229
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:22,066
- And that leaves
Nicole Paige Brooks.

230
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,767
- Save the best for last.

231
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,233
I was picked last, which I was
really surprised about,

232
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,600
to be honest.

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,667
- Nicole was left last
because this is a sexy contest,

234
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,767
and she's not sexy.

235
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,066
- In a moment, you'll meet

236
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,133
two top burlesque performers.

237
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,166
They're gonna give you
a crash course

238
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,300
in pole dancing,

239
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,700
with poles provided
by Platinum Stages,

240
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,066
plus each team
will be responsible

241
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:50,433
for styling
your burlesque outfits,

242
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:54,600
using materials courtesy of
Michael Levine Fabrics.

243
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,300
Gentlemen, start your engines,

244
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,066
and may the best woman...

245
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,300
win!

246
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,800
- We're gonna go with one print
'cause they don't match.

247
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,934
- I know they don't speak,
but it fits.

248
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,133
A girl in this on stage,

249
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,934
a girl in this, a girl in this,

250
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,233
a girl in this, and then another

251
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,767
girl in that,
and then that'll go fine.

252
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,600
You get what I'm sayin'?
- I don't like that.

253
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,900
I want us all to be in the same.
We're gonna all be in the same.

254
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,467
- Guys, we really need
to work as a team,

255
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,900
'cause I'm gonna
get frustrated.

256
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,934
Tyra's being difficult.

257
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,600
"I want this, I want this,"

258
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,934
it's all about her.

259
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,900
- Can I say something,
team captain?

260
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,467
- Sure. What is it, darling?

261
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,934
- This red fabric
that you chose?

262
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,000
- Uh-huh?
- It's shitty.

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
Like, really shitty.

264
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,266
- Tyra!

265
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,066
- Do you guys need a extra
person in your group?

266
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,900
- We're tired of all
your bitching out there.

267
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,233
- Pandora?
- Yeah?

268
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,400
- Do you not like me?

269
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,066
You didn't choose me
to be in your group.

270
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,266
I was hoping and praying
that you would choose me.

271
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,734
- I'm sorry.

272
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:56,800
- Now, look, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.

273
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
- Oh, my God, I am in a group
with, like, Satan's baby.

274
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,500
- Our challenge
is to create a burlesque act.

275
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,367
We're getting
pole-dancing lessons.

276
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,667
- Today, we're going to be
teaching you a few basic tricks.

277
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,767
- Oh, Lord.

278
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,367
[laughing]

279
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,433
Here we go.

280
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,266
- Gorgeous.

281
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,700
[applause]

282
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,200
There was a lot of vagina
in my face. [laughs]

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
I was like...

284
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,066
- Ladies, this is dropping it
like it's hot.

285
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,734
- Oh, my God!

286
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,266
- How do expect me to do that?

287
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,934
It doesn't move on me.

288
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,066
- Well, so who wants
to get started?

289
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,066
Any volunteers?

290
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,867
- La-la-la-la-la!

291
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm a flexible bitch
that can drop it like it's hot.

292
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,066
We gonna get on the pole
and do a upside down butterfly,

293
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,200
just have fun with it.

294
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,867
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

295
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,467
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

296
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,600
Ohh!

297
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,066
- Wow!
- Very good.

298
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,834
- Whoo!

299
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,633
- Wow!

300
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:01,567
[applause]

301
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,300
- [laughs]
That ain't sexy.

302
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,834
I want to try that again.

303
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,834
Your titties
are distracting me.

304
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:10,400
- I'm sorry. They--
that's what they're there for.

305
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,834
- Nicole is really sexy
and really sexual,

306
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:15,066
so I'm not really worried
about being, you know,

307
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,166
a tease,
'cause it's kind of what I do.

308
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,500
- Release and spin.

309
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,533
Much better!

310
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,233
Very good.
See?

311
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,734
That was awesome.

312
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:25,100
- Nicole cannot bring sexy back.

313
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
- Anybody else?
Come on, girl.

314
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,934
- Tyra, go.
- I can't.

315
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:31,734
- Oh, Tyra, go.
- I cannot do that.

316
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,266
- You have to do something.

317
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,633
- The way that I learn
is by watching others do it.

318
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,367
I'm not going to get up there

319
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,066
and just use
someone else's ideas.

320
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,567
- I'm the group leader,
and we all know

321
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,633
that the group leader's
the first one to go down,

322
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,767
so I am just hoping and praying
that everyone pulls through,

323
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,467
especially Miss Tyra.

324
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,467
Now how you guys feel
about the dancing?

325
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:51,900
Are y'all gonna be
okay with that?

326
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,333
- I feel like a whore slut.

327
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,200
- Is that a bad thing?
- Yes, that's a bad thing.

328
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,633
- But you're a bad girl,
remember?

329
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,767
- But I'm a bad girl,
I'm not a bad slut.

330
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:01,266
I feel that pole dancing, um,

331
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,200
it's kind of a little ho'-ish.

332
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,967
- I think we should just be
very positive about it,

333
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,467
and then it'll all come
together.

334
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,867
- It's fine,
as long as everyone cooperates.

335
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,734
There's no "I" in "team,"
after all, right?

336
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,567
- But there's a "me," girl.

337
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:16,767
- So far, I'm not quite clickin'
with the choreography,

338
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,633
just 'cause I want someone
to really, like,

339
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,967
slow it down for me so I get it.

340
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,934
- Pandora's just kind of
standing off to the side.

341
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,333
She's not really doing much,
so I tell Morgan,

342
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,066
"Girl, you should
choreograph this."

343
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,066
- I'm not trying to be bitchy,
but if you want, like,

344
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,266
choreography done,
like, let us do it.

345
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,800
There was a lot
of confusion going on,

346
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,233
and the time was
running out.

347
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,600
- I'm not reading you, by any
means, but you know what I mean?

348
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,100
Like, it's so confusing.

349
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,500
- Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying
to set it up at the beginning,

350
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,834
that's it.

351
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,633
- I went into shut-down mode
for a little bit,

352
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,166
because everybody
was just talking,

353
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,367
and it was very frustrating
and irritating.

354
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,600
I was like, "Oh, Christ."

355
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,367
- The two weakest people
should be in the back.

356
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,633
- Yeah.
- That's just an opinion.

357
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,266
- Okay, well,
let's just practice this,

358
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,967
and then as we figure out
who the weakest is

359
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,066
we'll move 'em around.

360
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,100
- Okay, let's try this.

361
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,467
Ready?

362
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,500
- I could be a bigger bitch.

363
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,834
- So can I, girl.

364
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,734
Miss Tyra decides that she
can't rehearse in heels.

365
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,066
- Are you gonna have me
rehearse like this?

366
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,367
You're gonna have me complainin'
about my feet hurtin'.

367
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,700
I know how my body works.

368
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,834
- Five, six, seven, eight...

369
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,400
- I'm just sitting back.

370
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,233
I'm puttin' everything
together in my head.

371
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm sayin', okay, girl,
do this and do that.

372
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,700
Like if they asked me now,
"Girl, do the routine,"

373
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,166
I would do it,
and I'd do it better

374
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,367
than what they did in there.

375
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,266
- We need to pick a color
that's gonna work.

376
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,767
- Well, if they're
not using this,

377
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,066
I think we should use this.

378
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:34,333
It's the most colorful,
and it's just sitting here.

379
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,767
- Do we need
to find out for sure

380
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:36,900
if they're not using that?

381
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,233
- No.
- No, they said they're done.

382
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,266
- 'Cause they're doing
that right there.

383
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,667
- This'll be hot.

384
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,066
- I think this is gonna pop
with black, I really do.

385
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,934
- Hey, that's our fabric.

386
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,133
She just took all our fabric.

387
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,967
- Because it's our fabric,
honey.

388
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,433
- I could have swore
you guys said

389
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:58,066
you were done with your fabric.

390
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,066
- No, we had all our fabric
over here that we were using.

391
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,100
Sorry you misunderstood.

392
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,800
- No, there was
no misunderstanding.

393
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,934
I have ears,
and they hear very well.

394
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,533
- No one's here to share.

395
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,600
We're not here to help.

396
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,300
We're not even here
to be friends.

397
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,800
- Did you need this fabric?

398
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
Well, do you need it,
or do you not need it?

399
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,166
- Hey.
- You owe me one.

400
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,200
- Thank you, darling.

401
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,667
- Cute, by the way.
I love them.

402
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,400
- Are you tryin' to be
fierce to me, Miss Tati?

403
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
- No!
I think they're cute.

404
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,166
- Just makin' sure, girl.
Just makin' sure.

405
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,433
- You think a lot, don't you?

406
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,133
But you think wrong
all the time.

407
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,767
- I do.
- You should think harder.

408
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,200
Thank you.

409
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,166
- Hi.
Hello, hello, hello.

410
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,600
Wow, look at this.

411
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,300
How's it going so far?

412
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,633
- I think it's going good.

413
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,667
- And do you feel like
you're really the leader?

414
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,734
- Um, I didn't
at a certain point, no.

415
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,533
I think that there's just
a lot of strong personalities.

416
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:47,600
- Really? Here?

417
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,633
- Just a few.

418
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:51,567
- Among drag queens?

419
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,700
- Do you feel as though
you've been an effective leader

420
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,367
for your team?

421
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:57,667
- Most definitely.

422
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,500
I think the end result
will show that as well.

423
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,300
- So you're okay that
one of your team members

424
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,333
is over there sleeping?

425
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,333
Are you worried?

426
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,233
- I am worried.

427
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,900
I am worried.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,233
- What am I to do?

429
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,233
- Well, it's, you know,
hard out there for a pimp.

430
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,166
- Don't wake her up.

431
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,767
She'll scream.

432
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,567
- Tyra, sweetie.

433
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,800
Darling?

434
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,934
Sweetie pie.

435
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,300
- Tired.

436
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,867
- You're tired?
- Yeah.

437
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,133
- Why you so tired?

438
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,367
- I don't know.

439
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,800
When Ru woke me up,
I'm like, "Shit!"

440
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,133
- Now, why do you think
everybody else is so busy,

441
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,900
but you have time to nap?

442
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,433
- Um, they're hot-gluing.
- Uh-huh.

443
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,500
- And I sewed, and it took me,
like, five minutes

444
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,533
to make my costume.

445
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,834
- You know,
you will be judged on

446
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,433
not only your individual,

447
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,100
but how well you work
with the group.

448
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,934
- I'm good.

449
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,066
I'm perfectly fine.

450
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,233
I don't have any doubt.

451
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:55,567
- All right, get back to bed.

452
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:59,467
All right, girls,
one last thing before I go.

453
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:03,433
Now, I'm gonna take you all
on a little field trip tomorrow

454
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,500
to Dragonfly.

455
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,767
It's a hot Hollywood club,

456
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,266
where you'll be performing
your main challenge

457
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:14,266
in front of an audience
of 100% grade "A" men.

458
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,934
Beef, honey. Beef.

459
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,333
Now, I want you to make sure

460
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,767
to bring your charisma,
uniqueness,

461
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,166
nerve, and talent.

462
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,367
Bye, y'all.

463
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,467
See ya.

464
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:28,166
[applause]

465
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,667
- I'm excited to get out

466
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,400
and it be a room full of men.

467
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,300
I can't fucking wait.

468
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,467
- Hey, girls,
welcome to Dragonfly.

469
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,133
This week,
Santino, Merle, and I

470
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:45,934
are joined by our
special guest judges,

471
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:49,367
one of my favorite funny ladies,
Kim Coles is here.

472
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,233
[applause]

473
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,567
And our extra
special guest judge,

474
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:58,100
the queen of burlesque,
Dita Von Teese.

475
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,367
[cheers and applause]

476
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:03,400
Now, in a moment, the team
that makes the most money

477
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,734
will be safe
from elimination this week,

478
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,433
and the girl on that team

479
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:10,700
who earns the most
will be the winner,

480
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,066
but first, what would
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> be</i>

481
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:17,066
without a little twist?

482
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:21,066
Today, you'll have two ways
to earn those dollars, honey.

483
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,800
While one team is working on
this stage,

484
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,834
the other will be
selling it on the street.

485
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,533
You hear that, Tyra?

486
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:31,567
Not you.

487
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,867
I'm talkin' about Tyra Banks.

488
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,400
[laughter]

489
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,700
- I hate goin' out the door
in drag in the daytime.

490
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,600
- And by "it," I mean cherry pie
gift certificates.

491
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,233
Cherry pie
gift certificates, sir,

492
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:47,200
courtesy of Cafe Audrey.

493
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,734
And one more thing.

494
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,600
Don't fuck it up.

495
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,967
- We have 60 minutes to sell

496
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,066
some cherry pie
gift certificates.

497
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,367
Help me out, buy some pie.

498
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:02,100
Team strategy is to get
out there and sell, sell, sell.

499
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,233
- Hi, would you like
to buy a cherry pie?

500
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,467
- Please, please,
don't make me beg.

501
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,400
- Please!
I need money!

502
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,433
- Does anybody want cherry pie
gift certificates, $5.

503
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,367
I don't know how
to approach people.

504
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:17,500
No?
Do you understand me?

505
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,567
Can you hear--
am I here?

506
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,367
Anybody?
Bueller?

507
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,967
- Buy the pie, baby.
Buy the pie. Please buy the pie.

508
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,600
- I think we might be
in trouble.

509
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,367
- Please help me.

510
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,233
- We're confident.
We're the pretty girls.

511
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,767
We're gonna sell sex, and isn't
that the name of the game?

512
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,400
- Nicole was having difficulty
with the choreography.

513
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,367
Big and messy
is not gonna cut it.

514
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,567
[cheers and applause]

515
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,600
[applause]

516
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,033
- I made a lot of money.

517
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,433
It rained on me a few times,

518
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,400
and I like to be wet.

519
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,633
- While I'm on stage,
I'm so incredibly nervous.

520
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,734
My heart is going
"Whum, whum, whum."

521
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,467
I feel like my boob's
gonna pop right out.

522
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,100
[cheers and applause]

523
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,367
- And as you pick up
crumpled money,

524
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,967
it looks like a lot more
than it is.

525
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,600
I realize it didn't rain.

526
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,033
It was enough to buy
a nice dinner

527
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,633
at the sizzler or something.

528
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,567
- Cherry pie.

529
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,166
all: Cherry pie!

530
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,467
Cherry pie!

531
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,200
- Oh!
Also I can do that for you.

532
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,533
- I got a dollar.

533
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:51,600
- Thank you, yay!

534
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,533
- Here's one dollar.

535
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,600
- Thank you.

536
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,767
- Thanks a lot.
Thanks.

537
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,600
- Ooh.
Watch your--

538
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,266
think soprano, though,
when you talk, girl.

539
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,433
- Hi, would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?

540
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,934
We got cherry pie
gift certificates!

541
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,834
- Tyra's surprising me,
actually.

542
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,767
I'm like, wow,
she actually has a personality?

543
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,633
- Hi. Would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?

544
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,367
- $5--
thank you, sir.

545
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,934
- You're welcome, okay.

546
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,633
- I looked like a $2 whore.

547
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,133
My grandmother's gonna kill me.

548
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,333
What you want?

549
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,100
- Let me see you guys
do a dance for this $20.

550
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,233
- Okay.

551
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,867
- I see her from the corner
with a $20 bill,

552
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,800
and I'm like, "Wait!

553
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,767
That's mine."

554
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,066
- Oh, yes!

555
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:34,600
- Miss Sahara, you stealin'
this sale from me, girl?

556
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,967
- The audience really
kind of got into it.

557
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,900
[cheers]

558
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:44,900
- They were all loving it,

559
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,767
eating out of
the palm of my hand.

560
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:49,400
I felt kind of like
I might have been

561
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,133
the skankiest on stage.

562
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,200
- I'm a nervous wreck
being in front of Dita.

563
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,967
She's the epitome of burlesque,
and there she is,

564
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,066
lookin' at you, you
know, judgin' you.

565
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,900
- We went out onto
Hollywood Boulevard,

566
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,834
and we're trying to sell
these gift certificates,

567
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:14,967
and there's Christians
and children and--oh.

568
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,166
I'm not cut out for this.

569
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,834
- You know you want
a taste of cherry pie.

570
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,900
- Nicole was loud.

571
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,367
- I'm serious, it's right there.

572
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,600
You're almost at Audrey's.
You know you want the pie.

573
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,467
- Raven, I always just kind of
saw her standing like a statue.

574
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,200
- You guys want to buy
cherry pie.

575
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,734
I can tell you love cherry pie.

576
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,133
- Sonique is rude.

577
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,600
- How much money do you have?

578
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
- Uh...

579
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,633
- Yes?

580
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,767
- Uh, well, I have some--

581
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,433
- You're wasting my time.
I got an hour.

582
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,967
- My time is expensive, too.

583
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:42,233
- All right, well,
then hit it, 'cause so is mine.

584
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,300
- Hey, daddy.

585
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Nobody wants cherry pie?

586
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,266
- Morgan, she's like,
"Hey, daddy."

587
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,667
La-la-la-la.

588
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,100
- We like pie.
Do you like pie?

589
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,567
- Cherry.
- Cherry pie.

590
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,934
- I don't like
to carry myself like that.

591
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm sweet in the streets
and, you know,

592
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,467
a freak in the sheets.

593
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,834
- Cherry...

594
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,667
pie.

595
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:16,567
- I look over at the judges,

596
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,533
and Dita Von Teese
was smiling, honey.

597
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:19,934
You can't crack her.

598
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,567
She sits there with this just
straight face, just beauty.

599
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,900
- All of our arguing
and bitching

600
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,734
and nagging at each other,
like, finally paid off.

601
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,266
- I feel excited.

602
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,667
I'm going to work that crowd.

603
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,800
- Whoo!

604
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,767
- Ow!

605
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,967
- I think I did a great job,

606
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,700
because I have a lot of money.

607
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,400
- Yeah!

608
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,734
- My strategy for my solo
is just to wow the crowd.

609
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:02,066
[cheers]

610
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,834
- Sellin' cherry pie.

611
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,066
Come and get it.

612
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,433
- Hello.

613
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:16,667
I love your hat.

614
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,667
- [pretending to cry]
Please, somebody buy cherry pie.

615
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,767
They just were running, running.

616
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,166
- You guys like cherry pie?

617
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,934
- He's running.
He's running from somebody.

618
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,500
They're like,
"Aah! It's a t-girl!

619
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,800
It's a t-girl!"

620
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,667
- Because I can't dance,

621
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,333
I figured I'd be sexual
and playful.

622
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,200
Every girl needs lip gloss,
right?

623
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,633
[cheers and applause]

624
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,734
- I'm thinking, do whatever it
takes to get your money.

625
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,100
[cheers]

626
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,066
[kicks stage]

627
00:24:56,066 --> 00:25:00,367
- My strategy is to demand money
from the men.

628
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,834
- I hope it pays off.

629
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,900
- Ow!

630
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,800
- [sighs]
Are you tired?

631
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,133
- Very much so.

632
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,567
- Elimination day is today.

633
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,367
Everyone's on pins and needles
because no one knows

634
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,233
how to measure
the other team's work,

635
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,166
so we're just anxious
to see who's on the bottom.

636
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,567
- Somebody stole
my mommy's picture.

637
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,100
I walk in the room,
and, you know,

638
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,266
first thing I'm thinkin' is,
got to say hello to Shawna,

639
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,400
my drag mother,
and she's not on the wall.

640
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,800
I've been robbed!

641
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,633
If anybody sees a 8x10
of Shawna Brooks,

642
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,400
maybe it got set
on their station by accident,

643
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,100
'cause it was on this wall
yesterday and now it's gone.

644
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,900
Being away from my family

645
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
was more than
I thought it was, you know?

646
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,567
I have a 2 1/2-year-old, Lucas.

647
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,834
He's at home,
and I miss him the most.

648
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,400
- Are y'all gonna
let him watch the show?

649
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,333
- When he's, like,
four or five maybe.

650
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,700
Hopefully, there'll be
an appropriate one to show him.

651
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,433
I'm just hopin'
that he's proud of his life.

652
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:56,066
Gonna be able to show him
I am at the top of my game.

653
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:58,166
He should be proud of what
his daddy does for a living.

654
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,066
He's gonna be able to say,
"My daddy's a drag superstar."

655
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:04,400
[laughs] You know?

656
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,533
- You guys still have
all your fathers, yeah?

657
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,767
- My father has cancer
right now, so...

658
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:11,834
- Oh! Mine--

659
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,400
mine passed away of cancer.

660
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,500
He had lung cancer.

661
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,600
- I don't really know--

662
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
I mean, we don't know
how long he has.

663
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,400
My father was just diagnosed
with cancer.

664
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,367
He's, you know, on chemo
and going through all of that.

665
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,333
- My father was always
just really upset about it,

666
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,867
because he knew
he was gonna die,

667
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,300
and he didn't know how we were
gonna take care of ourselves.

668
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,600
- So sad.

669
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,800
- Yeah, I mean, it is,
but just this, Pandora.

670
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,467
Just tell him you love him.

671
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,767
That's all.

672
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,700
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

673
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,066
- I don't, either.

674
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:45,233
I gotta put makeup on,
and I don't want it to smudge.

675
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,667
- Yeah, okay.

676
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,066
-There's a lot
of mixed emotions.

677
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,066
There's a lot of feelings
going on around the room.

678
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,100
People are wondering
which group's gonna be

679
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,800
up on the chopping block,
but still,

680
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,066
at the same time trying to hurry

681
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,133
and get ready
for the main stage.

682
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,934
[applause]

683
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,633
- Well, hello, judges.

684
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:22,467
- Hello.

685
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,567
- Hey, Ru.

686
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,233
- Have you recovered
from yesterday?

687
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,900
- That was insane.
- Oh!

688
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,967
- I thought it was fantastic.

689
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,467
- I enjoyed it very much.

690
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,100
- I wish my whole life
could be that.

691
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,266
- You wish your--

692
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,633
- I do. I do.

693
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:38,600
- Now, this week, the girls
were split into two teams

694
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,133
of burlesque dancers to see
who could earn the most dollars

695
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,800
dancing for tips and hustling

696
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,433
with cherry pie gift
certificates.

697
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,867
Tonight, I've asked them
to come decked out

698
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,066
in their high-class drag.

699
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,200
Are you ready, judges?

700
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,633
- Yes.
- Ready.

701
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,867
- Gentlemen...

702
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,567
start your engines,

703
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:05,600
and may the best woman win.

704
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,567
Sonique-a-nique-a-nique-a.

705
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,100
Oh, she's making a Sonique boom.

706
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,834
[laughter]

707
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,166
- With the lights goin'
and the music goin',

708
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,367
it was perfect,
so I hope they think I did good,

709
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,467
because I felt like
I did pretty good.

710
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,934
- Yes, ma'am, sell the garment.

711
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:26,066
Oh, my, this dress is wicked.

712
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,500
Are you a good witch

713
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,100
or are you a bad witch?

714
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
- When I head up my runway

715
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,133
and I feel like a diva.

716
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,533
- Almost looks like
toilet paper cozy.

717
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,834
[laughter]

718
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,967
In a couture sort of
toilet paper cozy kind of way.

719
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,066
- [gasps]
Wow, dark lady.

720
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,467
- She will take your man, honey.

721
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:44,500
- Yes, she will.

722
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,133
- I wanted to do something

723
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:48,200
simple that I could dress up.

724
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,333
I know I look fierce.

725
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,100
- I'm callin' that Cher 2010.

726
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,467
- Yes.

727
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:55,066
- Sahara, oh!

728
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,367
Stop in the name of love.

729
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,367
- [laughing]

730
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,433
- I feel great.

731
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,367
I'm sparkling,
the judges are smiling.

732
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,834
- Bob Mackie would be proud.

733
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,333
- I'm just livin', honey.

734
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,066
- Pandora Boxx.

735
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,300
- The shoes match the dress

736
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,967
kind of like the carpet
and the drapes.

737
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,467
- Yes!

738
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,867
- I like that dress because
it's a little bit different,

739
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:17,900
and I really thought that
it would make me stand out.

740
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,166
- Very L.A.

741
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,166
I came out to L.A.
to be an actress-slash-model.

742
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,333
- Actress-slash-model.

743
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:26,633
- Jujubee!
Is this a hostile takeover?

744
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,867
[laughter]

745
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,333
- I felt like Eartha Kitt.

746
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm servin' fish, honey,
and this ain't trout.

747
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,900
- Jujubee Fabulous!

748
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,333
- Nicole Paige Brooks.

749
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,834
- She looks like Courtney Cox.

750
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:39,934
- I looked like a real girl.

751
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,433
I looked like a model
on the runway,

752
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,533
which anybody wants me to model
their dress, sign me up.

753
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,967
I'll be more than happy
to do it.

754
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,734
- Yes, mama!

755
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:50,467
- Mystique Summers Madison.

756
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:52,500
Girl, your pussy is on fire!

757
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,867
- Oh!

758
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,600
- My outfit for the runway
is a nice, simple kind of

759
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,200
evening gownish,
'cause I'm a gown bitch.

760
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,166
- That girl will eat Beyoncé
in one swallow.

761
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,367
- [laughing]

762
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:07,367
- And she is telling you,
"I'm not going!"

763
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:10,967
- Send me Morgan McMichaels
from the secretarial pool.

764
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,367
- I didn't want to wear a gown.

765
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,600
That's boring to me when
everybody else is doing it.

766
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
- Oh, executive realness.

767
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,333
- [laughs]
Executive realness.

768
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:22,033
- Oh, my sweet gherkins!

769
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,700
There's a new Tyra in town.

770
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,000
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

771
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,300
- I know I looked good today,

772
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,000
because it was elegant,

773
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,900
it was over the top,
and it was still drag.

774
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,767
It gave you everything
you needed.

775
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,266
- I love the nappy pompadour.

776
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:37,767
- Yes, mama.

777
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:42,133
Tatianna Von Furstberg
Zeta-Jones!

778
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,633
- [laughing]

779
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,066
- She's giving Galliano
realness, yes.

780
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:49,600
- The look I'm going for
is Rihanna going to prom,

781
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,333
so I did the little
Rihanna bob with it.

782
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm feeling pretty confident.

783
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,767
- Very real.

784
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,800
Ladies, it's time to reveal

785
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,367
which team made the most money

786
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:05,667
and is safe from elimination.

787
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:09,934
And the winning team is...

788
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,800
Sahara Davenport's team.

789
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,767
[applause]

790
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:16,967
Congratulations.

791
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,166
You're all safe.

792
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,300
The winner of this challenge

793
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,467
is...

794
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,233
Sahara Davenport.

795
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,333
[applause]

796
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,867
In addition to immunity
next week,

797
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,934
you've won a $1,500
gift certificate

798
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,500
from sequinqueen.Com.

799
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,200
Thank you, ladies.

800
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Now you may leave the stage.

801
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,734
[applause]

802
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:45,433
Pandora Boxx, your team is up
for elimination.

803
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:46,867
What went wrong?

804
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:50,266
- I think maybe we just
didn't work the crowd enough

805
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,900
or something.

806
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,700
Now, let's talk about
your presentation

807
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,233
on the main stage today.

808
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:57,433
- I'm not loving
the overall look.

809
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:59,533
Visually, though, I thought
maybe you could have

810
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,767
pulled the parts together
a little better.

811
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,567
- This dress is not my favorite,
either.

812
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,066
I'm not a fan of the bands.

813
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,700
It kind of looked--
at first, I thought,

814
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,667
what was it, duct tape?

815
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,500
[Santino laughing]

816
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,834
- Thank you, Pandora.

817
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,200
- Thank you.

818
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,300
- Sonique, now, you really
made it rain on the stage,

819
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,200
but you came off
a little bit rude

820
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,266
on the street.

821
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,100
- My time is expensive, too.

822
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,333
- All right, well, then hit it.

823
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,333
- I was rude to, like,
one or two people,

824
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,200
but, I'm sorry,
it was hot out there.

825
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
I was in a hurry.

826
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,300
I was trying to raise
as much money as I could.

827
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,433
It was a challenge. You would
do the same thing, right?

828
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,533
- I do sassy,
I don't do bitchy.

829
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,066
Nicole Paige Brooks.

830
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,667
Now what are you serving
on the main stage?

831
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,600
- This was actually just
a backup that I brought,

832
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
because the first gown I had
technical difficulties with.

833
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,600
- I thought, more than anyone
when she walked out,

834
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,100
I was like, "Whoa! Is that
a real girl over there?"

835
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,200
And I like your little Megan Fox
tongue thing that you did,

836
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,233
but don't do it too much
like she does,

837
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,633
or else it loses effect.

838
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,834
- You could have looked like
a young Janice Dickenson,

839
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,233
but it came off
kind of like a drunken

840
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,567
Janice Dickenson at times.

841
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:02,066
- Ha-ha!

842
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:06,767
Our next lady is Tatianna,
a vision in purple.

843
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,166
How do you feel your hustler
game came through

844
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,633
on the challenge yesterday?

845
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,400
- I think it worked pretty well.

846
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,200
- One thing I really noticed was
one of the guys

847
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,767
asked your name
when you were done.

848
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,066
Nobody asked
anybody else's name.

849
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,767
They were fallin' in love
out there.

850
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,867
I called you Kim Kardashian
on steroids.

851
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,967
- Ooh, yeah.
- But in a good way.

852
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,100
- Yeah.
- In a good way.

853
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,900
Kim wished she looked that good.

854
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,834
- Raven, doin' the solo.

855
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,667
You didn't make
a lot of money there.

856
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,133
- No, I didn't.

857
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,133
When I started seeing
the other girls come back,

858
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,467
I thought, "Fuck,
I fucked this up."

859
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,266
- What would you
have done differently,

860
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,367
knowing how it went?

861
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,133
- I wouldn't have moved as much.

862
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,934
I would have gone
to the edge of the stage,

863
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,567
laid out, and let them
just throw the paper on me.

864
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:49,567
- Lady ATM.

865
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:50,867
[Santino laughing]

866
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:52,533
- You're very femme fatale.

867
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,834
I was a little bit scared.

868
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,333
I would not leave my man
in a room alone with you.

869
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,734
- Don't do it.
I'll work it.

870
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,800
[laughter]

871
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,834
- Morgan McMichaels.

872
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:03,834
- Yes.

873
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,900
- You have immunity.

874
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,066
- Yes, ma'am.

875
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,533
- You know, in a minute,

876
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,867
I'm gonna have to send
someone home.

877
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,200
Who should it be and why?

878
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:19,734
- The weakest person in the
group, you know, is Tatianna.

879
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:23,400
- Tatianna, who do you
think should go home today?

880
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,800
- I'm just gonna go with Morgan,
because she has immunity.

881
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,266
- Tatianna, that's an answer
for the Miss America contest,

882
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,533
not the<i> Rupaul Drag Race</i>
contest.

883
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,900
Nicole, same question.

884
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,066
- Send 'em all home.

885
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:36,266
- Send all these bitches home?

886
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,467
- Ooh!
- Okay.

887
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,433
Send all these bitches home.

888
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,066
- I mean, they eventually
all have to go,

889
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,867
so, I mean, I don't want
to be the one who goes,

890
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,066
so send 'em all.

891
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,300
- Raven, who would you
send home tonight?

892
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,166
- I would say Tatianna.

893
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,066
I don't think she wants to be,

894
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:53,500
like, a grand, superstar diva.

895
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,600
I think she's comfortable
being a beautiful girl.

896
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,433
- No.

897
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,333
- [laughing]

898
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,700
- Not the case.

899
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,633
If I was comfortable
being a beautiful girl,

900
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,867
I was a beautiful girl at home.

901
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,066
That's not why I'm here,
to be, like, pretty.

902
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:07,266
- Okay.

903
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,500
- Thank you.

904
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,667
- Just my opinion.

905
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,066
- All right.

906
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:15,200
Pandora, who should
I send home tonight?

907
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,367
- I think that the ho that made
the least amount of money

908
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,834
should go home.

909
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,767
But I don't know who that is.

910
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,734
[laughter]

911
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:27,533
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

912
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,800
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

913
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,100
the judges and I will
deliberate.

914
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,400
Thank you.

915
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,800
[engine starts]

916
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,166
This is the hardest part.

917
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,066
They're all fabulous kids,

918
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:40,333
but one of them has to go home.

919
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,500
Nicole Paige Brooks brought in

920
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,266
the least amount of dollars,

921
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:48,867
and Raven was second to last.

922
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:52,834
Raven seemed like she was
out of her element.

923
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,400
- The performance wasn't
my favorite performance,

924
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,800
but I think today she was
really exciting to watch.

925
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,133
- Had I not talked to her,

926
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,800
she was gonna be my bottom two,

927
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,600
but I like that sense of humor,

928
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,967
I like that little edge.

929
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,266
I'm not ready to see her go yet.

930
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,066
- Right. Now, Tatianna.

931
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,633
She's green.

932
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,166
- When I saw her dancing, I was
like, "She's the prettiest one."

933
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,967
- Do we give her the opportunity
to blossom on this show,

934
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,633
or do we say, "Look, honey,
you got to come prepared."

935
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,266
- She's gorgeous, however,
she didn't know how to make

936
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,533
her disadvantages
her advantages,

937
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,433
and everybody else here does

938
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,600
seem to know how to do that.

939
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,367
- Let's move on to Sonique.

940
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,734
- I definitely sort of sensed
a little, you know,

941
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,066
sort of feminine sweet like,
"I know I was kind of bitchy

942
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,700
to people on the street, but I
won't ever do it again, 'kay?"

943
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,200
- [laughing]

944
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,767
- Pandora was actually one of
the team's top money earners.

945
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,233
- She didn't stand out for me.

946
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,166
- I know you didn't like
her outfit.

947
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,633
- I hated that outfit.

948
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:47,066
- I equated it to, like, she
just got off the Greyhound bus.

949
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,533
Maybe that worked
to her advantage.

950
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:51,900
Maybe people like to see that
kind of starving, hungry look.

951
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,867
You know, maybe that's why
she made so much money.

952
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,066
I don't know.

953
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,066
- So she may not give
kind of great ass,

954
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,333
but she gives great sass.

955
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,400
- Yes.

956
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,967
- I just like her
sassy attitude.

957
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:04,233
- Nicole Paige Brooks.

958
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,567
She got a little lost
in the crowd. Do you agree?

959
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,633
- I do agree.

960
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,834
[imitating steady tone beeping]

961
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,700
That's death
in this competition.

962
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
- I kind of like the highs
and the lows.

963
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,700
The kind of bipolar.
To me, that makes life richer.

964
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,300
- Sure.
- And I'm just getting Prozac.

965
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,700
- Silence!

966
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,767
Bring back the girls.

967
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,100
Welcome back, ladies.

968
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,166
Based on your<i> Starrbooty-licious</i>
challenge

969
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,467
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,

970
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,967
I have made some decisions.

971
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,900
Morgan McMichaels,

972
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,066
you have immunity this week.

973
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:44,900
You're safe.

974
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,100
- Thank you.

975
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,066
- Sonique, on stage, the crowd

976
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,533
was turned on by your body,

977
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,400
but on the street, people were

978
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,133
turned off by your mouth.

979
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:01,433
No one wants a cherry pie
that bites back.

980
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,066
You're safe.

981
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,900
Nicole Paige Brooks,

982
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,567
you brought in
the least amount of money.

983
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:16,700
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.

984
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,066
- I was surprised I was
the lowest earner of tips.

985
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,066
I really thought that my
exuberance on the street

986
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,166
would have pulled me
out of the bottom.

987
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,467
- Pandora Boxx, you're safe.

988
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,533
- Thank you.

989
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:37,467
- Raven, you were the second
lowest earner,

990
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:41,166
and in a moment, you'll have
a chance to prove yourself.

991
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,800
You're up for elimination.

992
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,967
- When she told me
I was up for elimination,

993
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,066
my knees locked,
my head got dizzy.

994
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,667
I literally thought
I was gonna pass out.

995
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:53,467
- Tatianna,
sharpen your claws, baby.

996
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,200
It's a jungle out there.

997
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,734
You're safe.

998
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,767
Two queens stand before me.

999
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:03,867
I've consulted with the judges,

1000
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,467
but the final decision
is mine to make.

1001
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:12,233
This is your last chance
to impress me

1002
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:15,333
and to save yourself
from elimination.

1003
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,533
The time has come

1004
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:21,767
for you to lip sync

1005
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:25,066
for your life.

1006
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:29,433
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

1007
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,233
-<i> And now,</i>
<i>it's time for a breakdown.</i>

1008
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,500
[laughter]

1009
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,100
- Oh, yes!

1010
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,333
[cheers and applause]

1011
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:44,533
- I've made my decision.

1012
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,934
Raven...

1013
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:50,967
you will live to fly
another day.

1014
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,500
Shante, you stay.

1015
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,567
- Thank you.

1016
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,233
- Congratulations.

1017
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:56,867
- Thank you.

1018
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,133
- Nicole Paige Brooks,

1019
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:07,567
you are a fabulous queen.

1020
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:12,667
I send you home to carry on
the fine tradition

1021
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,800
of the Atlanta queens
who have come before you.

1022
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,767
Now, Sashay...

1023
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:20,767
away.

1024
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:21,767
- Thank you.

1025
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,467
Thank you.

1026
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,467
The fact that I even
walked through these doors

1027
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:30,100
is overwhelming to me,

1028
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,834
and definitely didn't think
I'd be leaving this soon.

1029
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:38,300
I'm ready to go home
and see my baby.

1030
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,700
- Ladies,
you know competition is hard.

1031
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,433
Ain't no half-steppin', mama.

1032
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:45,233
You have to bring it.

1033
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,867
That's what we're here for.

1034
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:51,200
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1035
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,667
how the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1036
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:54,900
Can I get an amen?

1037
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
all: Amen.

1038
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,066
- All right.

1039
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,567
Let the music play!

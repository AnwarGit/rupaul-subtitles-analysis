00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:07,233
- NOW, WHAT PART OF THE SHOW
WERE YOU THE MOST PROUD OF?

512
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:10,734
- BEING BRAVE,
AND TELLING MY STORY,

513
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:13,100
AND BEING ABLE TO BE
A VOICE FOR PEOPLE

514
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,367
WHO DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THEY HAD A VOICE.

515
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,300
I CAN BE WHO THE HELL
I WANT TO BE,

516
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,500
AND NOBODY CAN QUESTION ME
FOR IT, BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE.

517
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,967
- RIGHT, RIGHT, I LOVE IT.

518
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,967
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

519
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,266
- NOW, I KNOW YOUR DREAM

520
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:28,166
IS TO BECOME A BEYONCE
IMPERSONATOR, TRINITY,

521
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,100
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST KEEP ON BEING YOU,

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,700
FROM CLUB KIDS
TO PAGEANT QUEENS,

526
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,367
THIS SEASON,
THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF DRAG

527
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,033
RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

528
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:49,000
SO WE PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE
"HERSTORY" LESSON.

529
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,166
LEARN IT AND LEARN IT WELL.

530
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,934
WHAT IS DRAG?

531
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,734
DRAG IS UNDERGROUND

532
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:59,066
AND OVER-THE-TOP.

533
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,767
DRAG IS POLITICAL

534
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:03,133
AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT.

535
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,433
DRAG IS CAMP

536
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,033
AND COUTURE.

537
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,066
DRAG IS PUNK

538
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:11,066
AND MAINSTREAM.

539
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,400
DRAG IS A LAUGH RIOT,

540
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,233
AND IT COULD START A REVOLUTION.

541
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,500
DRAG IS NEVER HAVING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY,

542
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,100
BECAUSE DRAG IS ALL ABOUT BEING
WHOEVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO BE.

NOBODY IS INTERESTED

WHO HAVE AUDITIONED
YEAR AFTER YEAR, LIKE YOU DID?

608
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,600
- YOU KNOW, THIS WAS
MY FOURTH TIME AUDITIONING,

609
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,934
AND I THINK THE FIRST FEW TIMES
I WAS MAKING A STRONG EFFORT

610
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,700
TO GIVE YOU
WHAT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED,

611
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,734
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS
AUDITION THAT I JUST SAID,

612
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:31,967
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GOING TO BE ME."

613
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,500
SO MY ADVICE IS TO ALWAYS
STAY TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE,

614
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,967
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOUR SHINING
PERSONALITY WILL COME THROUGH.

- IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.

680
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,834
YEAH.

681
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,433
SO, DARIENNE,
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT.

682
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,133
WHAT WERE
YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH DELA?

683
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,400
- YOU KNOW,
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

684
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,500
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SHE SNAPPED, I SNAPPED.

685
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,900
WE KIND OF HAD A MOMENT,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW...

686
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,166
[LAUGHTER]

687
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT
ALWAYS HAVING GREAT TIMES,

688
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,233
IT'S ABOUT HAVING THOSE TIMES

689
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,300
THAT YOU NEED
TO STRUGGLE THROUGH,

690
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,934
SO I FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO HER.

691
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,166
- YEAH.

692
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,767
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL WATER
UNDER A DUCK'S BACK,

693
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,300
OR WHATEVER THE PHRASE IS.

694
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,567
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

695
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,567
DARIENNE, I DID
ACTUALLY WANT TO BRING

696
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:45,767
A LITTLE PEACE OFFERING.

697
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,567
YOU ONCE SAID THAT I WAS
LIKE A RUSSIAN DOLL,

698
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:52,100
AND SO HERE'S YOUR VERY OWN
DELA RUSSIAN DOLL.

699
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
- OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S MORE GOODNESS INSIDE!

700
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,233
- YES.
- IS THERE CANDY IN THERE?

701
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,166
[LAUGHTER]

702
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO.

703
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,400
AN APOLOGY,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

704
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,133
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND, YOU KNOW?

705
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,867
AND GIVING ME MY REALITY CHECK.

706
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:09,800
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY STRESS I CAUSED YOU.

707
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,166
[APPLAUSE]

708
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,700
- AW.

709
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,867
I LOVE THAT, I LOVE THAT.

710
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,767
NOW, DARIENNE,
YOU CONFIDED IN ME

711
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,567
THAT YOU'D HAD A BAD
FALLING-OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS,

712
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,934
AND, AS I'VE SAID,
WE GET TO CHOOSE OUR FAMILIES,

713
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,166
BUT SOMETIMES,
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY,

714
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,700
"DRAG RACE" CAN BRING
FAMILIES TOGETHER.

715
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,533
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

716
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,400
- HI, DARIENNE, IT'S MOM.

717
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,500
WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
WITH YOU TODAY,

718
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,533
BUT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW WE DID
WATCH A FEW OF THE EPISODES,

719
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,300
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU.

720
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,367
WE KNOW HOW TOUGH
IT WAS FOR YOU TO COME OUT,

721
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:45,133
AND TELL US WHO YOU ARE,
AND HOW YOU FEEL,

722
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:48,166
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU,

723
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,066
AND THAT WE SUPPORT YOU,

724
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:53,934
AND WE NOW ARE COMING OUT
AS DARIENNE'S PARENTS.

725
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:57,333
I'M HOPING THAT
WE CAN MAKE THIS MAYBE BE

726
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,767
THE FIRST DAY
OF THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

727
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:02,133
- HEY, DARIENNE, YOUR MOM
REALLY LIKED THE EARRINGS

728
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:05,967
YOU HAD ON THE OTHER NIGHT,
SO, GUESS WHAT?

729
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,567
I WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT HER A PAIR.

730
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,000
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

731
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,033
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, SON.
- WE LOVE YOU, DARIENNE.

732
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,700
- AW!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

733
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,300
- SO, DARIENNE, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

734
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,333
- I NEVER,
IN A MILLION YEARS,

735
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,867
THOUGHT THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN,

736
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,266
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

737
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:31,200
AND I LOVE YOU, GUYS, YOU KNOW?

738
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,033
SO...BRAVO.

FIRST, THE NUMBER ONE
QUESTION ONLINE IS,

787
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:52,433
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF LAGANJA
AND ADORE'S RELATIONSHIP?

788
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,800
- OOH.

789
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,066
- YOU TWO ARRIVED AS FRIENDS,
BUT YOU HAD THIS HUGE BLOW-UP,

790
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,300
SO WE BROUGHT YOU BACK TOGETHER

791
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,967
TO WATCH THAT MOMENT
BEFORE IT AIRED.

792
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,633
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

793
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,133
- HI.
- AND THIS GIRL.

794
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:08,433
- [LAUGHS]
HOW ARE YOU?

795
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:09,967
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, GOOD.

796
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,367
THIS IS GOING TO BE
REALLY INTERESTING.

797
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,934
- A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
- I'M SCARED.

798
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:16,500
- LET'S DO IT,
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.

799
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,233
- THIS RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S THE BITCH THAT I KNOW.

800
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,734
I DON'T KNOW "YES, MAMA."

801
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:23,300
- WHEN I'M WITH MY BEST FRIENDS
I SAY, "YES, MAMA."

802
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,567
- THAT AIN'T HOW YOU TALK
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH YOU

803

WHEN THE CAMERAS AREN'T HERE.

804
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,567
- NOW I AM ANNOYING, I AM FAKE,
I'M NOT WHO I'M BEING...

805
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,867
- HOLD UP. HOLD UP, BITCH.

806
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,567
- I'M PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY I'M NOT...

807
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,700
- NO, THAT'S WHAT I DID NOT
WANT TO MAKE IT, GANJA.

808
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,867
- WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL IN THIS MOMENT?

809
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,200
- GANJA, I DIDN'T
WANT TO MAKE IT

810
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,900
THAT EVERYBODY
WAS ATTACKING YOU.

811
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,233
- YEAH, I FEEL VERY ATTACKED!

812
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO COME OFF
LIKE HOW IT CAME OFF,

813
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,433
BUT I WAS JUST, LIKE,
REALLY FRUSTRATED.

814
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:54,800
LIKE, YOU PUT THAT ON
TO DO SOMETHING

815
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,100
FOR, LIKE, A CHARACTER
OR SOMETHING.

816
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,667
I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
HEARD YOU TALK LIKE THAT,

817
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,767
IN MY LIFE.

818
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,567
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY.

819
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,400
- BUT THEN YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THAT'S YOU.

820
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,667
- YOU CAN SAY
THAT ALL THIS IS FAKE,

821
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,066
BUT THIS IS REAL, BITCH.

822
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,800
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M STILL
STICKING BY TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

823
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,667
I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THAT WAS GENUINE.

824
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,233
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO TURN
INTO A BULLYING LAGANJA THING,

825
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,967
BECAUSE I FUCKING
FELT BAD FOR YOU,

826
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:25,667
AND I STILL HAVE YOUR BACK,
EVEN THOUGH I HEAR THINGS.

827
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,233
- I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S THINGS THAT...

828
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:32,066
AHH, YOU'VE HEARD
BECAUSE I'M FUCKING JEALOUS.

829
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,200
- LIKE...

830
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,333
- I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY FRIEND.

831
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,200
- I FEEL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE
A CONVERSATION, LIKE,

832
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,934
IN PRIVATE.

833
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:54,600
- SO, ADORE, DID YOU TWO END UP
HAVING A PRIVATE CONVERSATION?

834
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,266
- THERE IS A CUTE, LITTLE BAR
ACROSS THE STREET,

835
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,500
SO WE GOT A COUPLE
OF DRINKS, AND...

836
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,433
[LAUGHS]
WE ACTUALLY TALKED IT OUT,

837
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:03,834
AND I DID REALLY HAVE
A STRONG CONNECTION WITH LAGANJA

838
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,033
BEFORE COMING
INTO THIS COMPETITION,

839
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:07,867
SO WE'RE AT A GOOD PLACE
RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY ARE.

840
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,900
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

841
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,200
- SO, LAGANJA, DO YOU THINK
THE FRIENDSHIP IS MENDED?

842
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,467
- ABSOLUTELY.

843
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,667
RELATIONSHIPS GO THROUGH
TOUGH TIMES, AND WE'VE MOVED ON,

844
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,266
AND, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE ADORE WITH ALL MY HEART.

845
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,133
THAT'S MY SISTER,

THE TALK THAT YOU GAVE ME.

NO ONE HAS, LIKE,
EVER, LIKE, SAT ME DOWN

1031

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,567
HAVING SEEN THE SHOW?
- IN THE BEGINNING,

AND CARRY ON YOUR LEGACY,
I THINK IT'S TIME.

I MEAN, LADY GAGA IS DOING IT.

1073
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:24,300
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HER AND I IS I HAVE A PENIS,

THAT KNEW BEYONCE MEDLEYS.

1171

AND I WAS FRIENDS
WITH LADY BUNNY,

00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,767
- FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
WHO HAS WORKED IN THIS BUSINESS

1181
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:18,533
FOR 18 YEARS,
IS GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY,

1182
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:21,100
THIS PLATFORM,
HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL.

1183
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,867
TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY AND GET
TO MEET ALL THESE PEOPLE,

1184
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:25,533
AND THE FACT THAT I'M NOW A PART
OF IT IS PRETTY FUCKING CRAZY.

1185
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:27,734
- IT IS, IT IS.
- IT'S INSANE.

1186
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,200
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

1187
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,667
- YOU ARE A QUEEN
WHO SPEAKS HER MIND.

1188
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,166
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU TO WATCH?

1189
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,867
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.

1190
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,700
I HAD THOSE MOMENTS
WHEN I WOULD CRINGE,

1191
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,967
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"OH, SHIT."

1192
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:45,100
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT,"

1193
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,333
BUT I THINK THAT
IN THAT SITUATION, YOU KNOW,

1194
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,367
IT BRINGS OUT THE GOOD
AND BAD IN EVERYBODY.

1195
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:50,700
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU

1196
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,500
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?

1197
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,200
- WELL, IT WOULD MEAN
THAT I BEAT THESE OTHER BITCHES.

1198
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,533
NO.
[LAUGHTER]

1199
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,233
I THINK IT'D BE AMAZING,
I MEAN, I'M IN GREAT COMPANY.

1200
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:59,934
AND I'VE REALIZED THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO BE A LIP-SYNC ARTIST,

1201
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,734
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A DANCER,
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A SINGER,

1202
00:51:02,734 --> 00:51:06,567
I CAN BE ME, WHICH IS A FOOL,
AND DO IT ON THAT LEVEL.

00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,266
- SO, LOLA, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ROY LADY?

1208
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:22,166
- LASHES AND LIPSTICKS
AND HIPS THAT KILL,

1209
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,567
RUPAUL, YOU SURE HAVE
SOME BIG HEELS TO FILL.

1210
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,567
BUT I KNOW BIANCA,
I'M HER NUMBER ONE FAN.

1211
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:32,433
IF YOU CROWN HER OUR QUEEN,
I WON'T TELL SHE'S A MAN.

[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

1213
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,100

A HARD AND HILARIOUS BITCH,

1214
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,633
BUT IT'S REWARDING TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE A NICE ONE, TOO.

1215
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:52,266

OUR LESSON IN THE ABCs OF DRAG,

1219
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:03,433
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THE C-WORD IS.

NEXT TOP MODEL?

1225
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,734
MY NAME IS COURTNEY ACT.

1226
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,367
I GUESS MY REPUTATION COULD
INTIMIDATE THE OTHER QUEENS.

1227
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:20,867
I'M A SINGER.
- OH.

1228
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:24,500
- ♪ I'M GOING TO BE
THE GREATEST STAR ♪

1229
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,166
- YOU ARE A STAR.

1230
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:28,300
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE

1231
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,433
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
- [LAUGHS]

1232
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:31,400
- YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.

1233
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,834
- COURTNEY KNOWS HOW TO DO SEXY.
SHE'S A NATURAL.

1234
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,233
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?

1235
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:36,633
- [GRUNTS]

1236
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:39,266
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.

1237
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:42,467
- SHE DOES RELY ON THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

1238
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:43,467
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

1239
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:45,400
- COURTNEY ACT
IS AN IMMENSE TALENT

1240
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,600
WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.

1241
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,967
- I AM ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION
FROM CHER!

1242
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:55,967
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH
IN MY HETEROSEXUALITY

1243
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:58,467
TO SAY "WOW."

1244
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,767

[APPLAUSE]

1246
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:03,800
- HAS BEING IN THIS COMPETITION
ADDED PRESSURE?

1247
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,100
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY
A STAR DOWN UNDER.

1248
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,433
- COMING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
THERE WAS SUCH HIGH EXPECTATION,

1249
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,633
AND IT DID ADD
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

1250
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:14,633
I LEARNT SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF
GOING THROUGH THIS COMPETITION.

1251
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:15,600
- LIKE WHAT?

1252
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,700
- AUSTRALIANS DO HAVE
A VERY BLUNT,

1253
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,667
KIND OF HONEST SENSE OF HUMOR,
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES

1254
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:23,100
WHERE I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS BEING HELPFUL,

1255
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,967
AND I WATCH IT BACK,
AND I'M LIKE,

1256
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:27,934
"OOH, DID SHE JUST SAY THAT?"
- [LAUGHS]

1257
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:30,433
- SO I'M DEFINITELY
LEARNING TO CHIP AWAY

1258
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:33,000
THAT SORT OF COLD
AUSTRALIAN EXTERIOR.

1259
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,633
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU

1260
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:36,834
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?

1261
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:38,700
- I MOVED FROM AUSTRALIA
3 YEARS AGO.

1262
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,433
I MOVED FROM A FANTASTIC LIFE
INTO, LIKE,

1263
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:43,467
A SHOEBOX APARTMENT
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD,

1264
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,600
EARNING LESS MONEY
I DID WHEN I WAS 18,

1265
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,066
AND IT WAS A STRUGGLE, BUT EVERY
MOMENT OF IT I WAS SO EXCITED,

1266
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:51,433
BECAUSE I GOT TO BE HERE
LIVING MY DREAM.

1267
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:54,133
AND IN JUST 3 YEARS
I'M SITTING ON THIS STAGE

1268
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:57,433
AS ONE OF THE TOP 3
IN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."

1269
00:53:57,433 --> 00:54:00,667
JUST HAVING THAT DREAM
VALIDATED, IT IS OTHERWORLDLY.

1270
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,100
SO I THANK YOU,
AND I THANK YOU,

1271
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,333

00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:11,000
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HERE

1276
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,266
TO SUPPORT YOU TONIGHT?

1277
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:15,333
- I HAVE GOT A FRIEND HERE
WHO I ACTUALLY MET ON THE SHOW.

1278
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,000
MR. CHAZ BONO.

1279
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,400

00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,533
- OH, MY GOODNESS!
[LAUGHS]

1281
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:24,333
- HE WAS DOING
A MUSICAL PRODUCTION,

1282
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,100
AND HE ASKED
IF I WOULD BE IN IT.

1283
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,734
WE GOT TO BECOME FRIENDS.

1284
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:29,600
IT'S JUST KIND OF,
LIKE, BLOSSOMED.

1285
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,367
CHAZ CAME TO AUSTRALIA
WITH ME TO--

I MEAN, SHE IS LOOKING
PARTICULARLY LOVELY TONIGHT.

1299
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:57,867

00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:03,367
- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:07,133
We're throwing the first ever
Sugar Ball.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,133
[all gasp]

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,500
Are you passionate about

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,967
becoming America's next drag
superstar?

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,200
- You're wrong, Jinkx,
on the lollipop.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,467
- Roxxxy's grasping at straws
to try to shake me.

8
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:25,800
- Jinkx, your sweet 16 party
girl--16 going on 47.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,033
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect

10
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,834
and it makes me question
your taste level.

11
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:35,433
- Alaska, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.

12
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,867
- [squeals]

13
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,333
- Jinkx Monsoon...

14
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,467
shantay, you stay.

15
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:44,333
Detox, sashay away.

16
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,800
- [whimpers]

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,633
- Holy shit.

18
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,000
- Detox just went home.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,667
This has been the hardest
elimination for me.

20
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,700
My baby.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,934
- What giant lips she has.

22
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:05,166
- If I was
on that judges' panel,

23
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,533
Jinkx would have been gone.

24
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,700
Jinkx does not deserve
to be here.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,200
No offense, Jinkx, but I know
what they were saying about

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,700
looking 70 'cause you did look
a little older.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,567
- But that's how Jinkx Monsoon
would have looked.

28
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,633
She would have been 16
in the '70s.

29
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,066
I know Roxxxy is upset that she
doesn't get to go through this

30
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:26,400
last part of the competition
with her best friend.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,533
But I'm not gonna stop fighting
for this

32
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,467
until the very, very end.

33
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:34,934
- One of the three of us is
going to win $100,000.

34
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,166
- How many challenges have you
won, Jinkx?

35
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,633
- Two. We've all won two.

36
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,500
- You've won two and I've won
two.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,700
- Ooh, an even playing ground
except I've never lip-synced.

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm coming right off winning
last week's challenge.

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,400
So I just say bring it on,
darling.

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Alaska is back in full force.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,934
- Alaska thinks she can just

42
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,433
slide right underneath the radar
and go for the crown.

43
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,467
But guess what, bitch.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

44
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,900
Alaska, my dear, sashay away.

45
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,200
- Words you will never hear.

46
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,500
- The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,066
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,

48
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,066
a luxury trip courtesy
of ALandCHUCK.travel,

49
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,433
headline Logo's Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut vodka--

50
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:25,433
cocktails perfected--and a cash
prize of $100,000.

51
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,200
- Top three, fantasy.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,567
- Top three,
fantasy.

53
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,066
Where my top three at?

54
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,367
- [sighs] Aw, look.

55
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,166
I have a note.

56
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,066
- Oh, my gosh.

57
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,667
A little note from Detoxy.

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,500
- It says, "Roxxxy, this was
such an amazing journey

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,066
and I'm so thankful to have made
it with you."

60
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:55,367
- Mine says, "Lasky, you're
fucking terrible.

61
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,066
I love you so much."

62
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,133
- And--and I didn't get a note.
[laughs]

63
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,333
- You didn't get a note?

64
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,667
- No.

65
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,100
- Well, here. I'll make one up
from Detox to you.

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,300
"Jinkx, you sent me home,
you fucking hot fucking mess."

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,266
[laughs]

68
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,400
[alarm blares]

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,734
- Ooh, girl.

70
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,767
You've got shemail.

71
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:18,600
Ladies, make a case why you
should be America's

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,133
next drag superstar and you
could be awarded

73
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,233
a judgment of $100,000.

74
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:30,233
And if you're really lucky,
you might even get a hung jury.

75
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,734
- What?

76
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,100
- Hello, hello, hello.

77
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,734
[all squeal]

78
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:36,967
- She has legs.

79
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,100
- And I know how to use 'em.

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
- [laughs]

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,567
- The final three!

82
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,166
Condragulations.

83
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,433
[all cheer]

84
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:48,700
RuPaul is getting some
last-minute cosmetic procedures.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,133
So he asked me to tell you
all about your final challenge.

86
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,467
And it's a doozy.

87
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,767
This week, you'll be starring
with RuPaul

88
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:01,600
in the official music video
for<i> The Beginning.</i>

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,133
- [squeals]

90
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,800
- You'll be working with
choreographer Candis Cayne.

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,967
- Continental.

92
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:10,066
- And then, with director
Mathu Andersen,

93
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,233
you'll be shooting a dramatic
courtroom scene.

94
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,166
And each of you will be playing
defendant,

95
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,800
defense attorney,
and prosecutor.

96
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,533
All three parts.

97
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:25,867
And on the main stage, you'll
need to defend your life

98
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:29,600
and convince the judges and the
world why you deserve

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,467
to be America's next drag
superstar.

100
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,066
- If there's something
in this competition

101
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,066
that I've been waiting for,
it's to express to these judges

102
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:39,133
why I should be America's next
drag superstar.

103
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,467
- To help you build an ironclad
case, you'll each have

104
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:46,867
one-on-one time with mega
attorney Gloria Allred.

105
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,567
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

106
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,667
- And if that wasn't enough,

107
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,600
you're having lunch
with RuPaul too.

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,667
- Oh, my god.
- [laughs]

109
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:58,367
So don't fuck it up.

110
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,533
- Hello, girls.

111
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,867
all: Hi.

112
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:05,934
- Last year, I had choreography,
but to step it up,

113
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:10,066
I thought I would add a little
chiffonography.

114
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,800
Today, we're going for a
seductive, goddess-y theme.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,834
A lot of fans, a lot of hair, a
lot of chiffon in the fan.

116
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:22,467
I want you to be sexy, soft,
beautiful.

117
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,100
- Okay.

118
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,867
- Five, six, seven, eight.

119
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,633
One, two, three, four,

120
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,333
five, six, seven, eight.

121
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,233
One, two, three, four,

122
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:34,500
five, six, seven, eight.

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,266
- [squeals]

124
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,633
- Alaska, you're getting
nervous, it seems like.

125
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,934
And think about not turning in.

126
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:44,367
'Cause that's kind of not the
choreography.

127
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,333
- I'm making a fool of myself
in front of Candis Cayne.

128
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,433
- All right, girls.

129
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,066
We're gonna do some hairography.

130
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,166
Bring me my fan.

131
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,600
[all gasp]

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,133
The basic point of fan use is
all about flicking your hair.

133
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:03,633
The fast and then the slow.

134
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,066
Very good.

135
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,266
- I am definitely the most sexy.

136
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,500
I know how to work some
motherfucking hair.

137
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,900
And, uh, I like being blown.

138
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,533
- Give me goddess.

139
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,300
Try not to let your hair
in your face.

140
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,433
Uh...

141
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,633
This is challenging
choreography.

142
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,233
Think more Beyonce and less
Cousin It.

143
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,300
But, you know,
this is the top three

144
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,233
and I really need them
to step up.

145
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,266
Whip it.

146
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,200
-<i> Bonjour.</i>

147
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,467
- It's time for us to shoot a
music video

148
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,734
for RuPaul's<i> The Beginning.</i>

149
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:46,800
Nice car.

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,834
- [laughs]

151
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:48,967
- The basic idea here is that

152
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,967
you're driving into the wild
blue yonder

153
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,100
and you're going to fly
to heaven.

154
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,200
[all laugh]

155
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
- Wow.

156
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,367
- Action. Whoa!

157
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,433
Whoa!

158
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,400
And left.

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,767
- Oh!

160
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,867
- Okay, we have a tragedy.

161
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,567
- Oh, she trying to pull the
patch!

162
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,900
- [yelps]

163
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,233
Dear god, do I really have
to be attached to her now too?

164
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,734
- Drive, drive, stop!

165
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,333
[horn beeps]

166
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,700
- Whoa!
- What?

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,266
[all laugh]

168
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:26,567
- Jinkx kind of took over,
going crazy and having fun.

169
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,467
- [laughs]

170
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,433
- And here she is.

171
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,300
It's Mama Ru.

172
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,333
Oh, my lord.

173
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,567
Alaska, shake your hair out.

174
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:45,100
- Alaska, did you not get
the concept of hairography?

175
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,600
Afro?

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,934
- Okay, we've sped this song up
1 1/2 times

177
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,400
so that when we slow it down,

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,266
the effect will be lip-syncing
perfectly to the song.

179
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,800
Let the chipmunkery begin.

180
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,467
Cue the music.

181
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,467
[song sped up]

182
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:04,900
[rapid, high-pitched singing]

183
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,333
- What?

184
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:11,333
- And now we have to sell the
lip-sync at double the speed?

185
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,667
I feel like I'm going insane.

186
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,066
-<i> ♪ It's a brand-new day ♪</i>

189

- Cut.

190
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,300
Let the chiffon drift.

191
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,600
Give me mystery.

192
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,567
-<i> ♪ You decide ♪</i>

195
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,233
- Cut.

196
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:29,200
- Alaska's movement
is a little awkward.

197
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,900
She had trouble
with the chiffonography.

198
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,934
- Cut.

199
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:33,900
-<i> ♪ You decide ♪</i>

200
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900

-<i> ♪ Miracles happen every day ♪</i>

203
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,500
- Yeah! Spin!

204
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,767
- Roxxxy did great hair
movement.

205
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,934
- Give it a spin, Roxxxy!

206
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,266
-<i> ♪ This is the beginning ♪</i>

207

208

- She had her lip-sync down
really good.

209
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,734
- Yay!
- Nice.

210

00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,367
- Good job, Roxxxy.

214
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,467
- Amazing.

215
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,834
All right, ladies.

216
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,433
- Give me goddess.

217
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,467
Hit it!

218
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,066
Six, seven, eight.

219
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:05,200
And one, look,
three, four, five.

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,734
Cut.

221
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:08,967
I need you to be on, Alaska.

222
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,367
It's about precision, precision,
precision.

223
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,667
From the top.

224
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,900
Five, six, seven, eight.

225
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,667
One, two, three, four.

226
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,100
Pick it up, Alaska.

227
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
Cut.

228
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,934
- The other girls are doing
really good

229
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:26,066
and their hair is flowing
and their chiffon is flowing in

230
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:31,333
the right places, and I'm, like,
terrible and this is awful.

231
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:41,834
- What are your winning
qualities?

232
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,200
- Um...

233
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,333
- You need to believe
in yourself.

234
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,200
- For you to just discredit
all my work--

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
- I know, you're the victim.

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,300
- I have done well
in this competition

237
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
and I love what I do.

238
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,433
- Huh?

239
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,300
[laughter]

240
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,633
- Hi.
- Hi, Alaska.

241
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:11,066
- Gloria Allred is a mega lawyer
who is known for

242
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:14,233
taking on really high-profile
cases.

243
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,600
- Make yourself comfortable.

244
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,567
- Tomorrow, we are going to have
to present

245
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,433
our final arguments
as to why we should be

246
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,133
America's next drag superstar.

247
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,900
- Let's go right to what your
case is gonna be.

248
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,800
What are your winning qualities
that are unique to you?

249
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
- I have star quality.

250
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,133
The "X" factor.

251
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,367
- That's not good enough.

252
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,700
Give me specifics.

253
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,967
What is your most important
strength?

254
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,066
- Um...

255
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,400
- Just lay it on me.

256
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,467
- Well, I mean, I guess we can
see which one

257
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:49,567
you think is the most impactful.

258
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,734
- Okay, but you need to believe
in yourself.

259
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,734
Now, when you go out there
to make your argument,

260
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,934
you're gonna need to make it
with confidence.

261
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:01,867
Do you think you can do that?

262
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
- Hello, Mother.

263
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,633
- Hi, Jinkx.

264
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,800
How's tricks?

265
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,834
- Tricks are for kids.

266
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,066
I'm a lady.

267
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,266
- [laughs]

268
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,066
Listen, I hope you have
an appetite.

269
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,066
- Oh, yes.

270
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,900
This looks more than I can
handle.

271
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,800
- Now, Jinkx, what do you think
your life's gonna be like?

272
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
What--what do you want to do?

273
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,834
- It's been my life dream ever
since I started doing drag

274
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,533
to do drag on Broadway.

275
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,467
- I could see you
as Blanche DuBois.

276
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,567
- I could see that too.

277
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,967
- So what was it like for you
growing up?

278
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,400
I know that you had to sort of
grow up really fast.

279
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,133
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me about that.

280
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:43,633
- I had no real mother in my
house when I was a teenager

281
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,834
because of her alcoholism.

282
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,400
There were times where me and my
brothers wouldn't have

283
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,533
gone to school that day if I
hadn't gotten us up.

284
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,900
- What effect has that had on
who you are as Jinkx Monsoon?

285
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,700
- This is my way of making peace
with a dark childhood

286
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,333
and make light of the disheveled
kind of crazy, kooky mom.

287
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,166
And then I adapted into my
mature drag queen

288
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,867
from yesteryear character.

289
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:15,133
- Right, so--and so you're
saving the Britney Spears

290
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,633
part of your career for later.

291
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:22,867
- It never even occurred to me
before my lunch with Ru

292
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:28,166
that maybe the reason I do drag
as an older character

293
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:32,800
is because I never really
connected with my childhood.

294
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,467
- I think you're
a really bright star

295
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,400
and I'm so happy you're here.

296
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,667
- Thank you.
I'm happy I'm here too.

297
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,500
- [laughs]
- And I'm not gonna eat these.

298
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,467
I'm gonna make a necklace
out of 'em.

299
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,600
- Oh, good.
[laughs]

300
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,834
- What are your unique strengths
that should persuade the judges

301
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,066
and everyone else
to vote for you?

302
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,867
- My unique strengths are that I
have shown you

303
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,266
that time after time,
when presented challenges,

304
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:01,066
that I could succeed even when I
didn't believe I could.

305
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,700
And I learned that not being
perfect is being perfect.

306
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
- Okay, let's stop right now.

307
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,900
What you don't want is you don't
want kind of pageant babble.

308
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
- Okay.

309
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,166
- As the kids would say,
keep it real.

310
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,834
You think you can do that?

311
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,633
- Yeah.
- All right.

312
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,133
What are some of the obstacles
that you have faced

313
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,266
and how have you overcome those
obstacles?

314
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,700
- Actually before coming
to this competition,

315
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,166
I wanted to quit doing drag.

316
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,400
I was done.

317
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,100
I was done with the criticism
from the audience.

318
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,066
I was done with nobody
wanting to date me

319
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,767
because I'm a drag queen.

320
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,567
- Okay, but how did you
overcome it?

321
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,400
- Woman, can I speak?

322
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,867
- Remember, I want to...
- Yeah. I--well--

323
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,300
- Get the negative
into the positive.

324
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,633
- I overcame it by realizing
that God has given me a gift.

325
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,266
And I consider myself
a chameleon.

326
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,066
'Cause when the lights, camera,
action, that curtain opens

327
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,400
and you don't know
what's coming out,

328
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,133
that's the excitement of going
to a drag show.

329
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,433
- What would you say are some
of the weaknesses

330
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,867
of your competitors, Roxxxy?

331
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,900
- Jinkx needs to stop being
such a one-shtick kind of girl.

332
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,767
Alaska, in the kids' show,
came out as a boy.

333
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:08,834
This is a drag competition.

334
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,066
Where's the beauty?

335
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,400
Where's the creativity?

336
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,166
It pisses me off.

337
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,633
- You're showing passion,
so that's all good.

338
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:19,066
But how can you say this without
being too, kind of, catty?

339
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,800
- Hello, Alaska.

340
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,066
- Hi.

341
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:25,066
- [laughs]

342
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,133
Now, if you win,
what would it be like

343
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,934
to be part of drag's first
royal couple?

344
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,500
- Wow, I would feel just like
Kate Middleton.

345
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,967
I would rule the drag world
with dignity and grace

346
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,900
and lots of lace front wigs.

347
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,066
- [laughs]

348
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,100
Tell me something I don't know
about you.

349
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,934
What are you afraid of?

350
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,767
- I have a fear of dying.

351
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,200
- Why?

352
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,066
- Because I f--I've worked--

353
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,233
I've worked so hard to get so
many things in my life

354
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,533
that I'm so happy to have.

355
00:14:56,533 --> 00:15:00,433
And I guess it's just a fear of,
like, losing that.

356
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,367
Like, my relationship
with Sharon.

357
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,433
It's like a castle that we built
and I don't want it to--

358
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,600
to go away by me dying,
you know?

359
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,734
It's a crazy love that Sharon
and I have

360
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:17,467
and it's something that I never
expected to happen.

361
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,867
She's my soul mate.

362
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,767
And I don't know that I've ever
had that before.

363
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,266
- Don't be afraid of that.

364
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,900
Just practice living
in this moment.

365
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,867
Think about how sweet it is
right now.

366
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,934
I am so proud of you.

367
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,333
Good luck, sweetheart.

368
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,734
- Thank you.

369
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,066
- What do you think
are your strengths

370
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,100
that are superior to your
competitors'?

371
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,567
- I'm a captivating performer
onstage

372
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,633
and I think comedy and the
ability to make people laugh

373
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,867
is such a huge and important
part of drag.

374
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,800
- But what about your
competitors?

375
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,333
I noticed you kind of shied away
from that.

376
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,700
- The thing that pushes me out
of my comfort zone the most

377
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,867
is when I have to talk poorly
about my other competitors

378
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:02,934
because I have a huge respect
for every drag queen.

379
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,066
- You sound like a person who
wants to be positive,

380
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,133
but in this competition...

381
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,266
- Yeah.

382
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,166
- You're gonna need to elevate
yourself up...

383
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,266
- Mm-hmm.
- And move them down.

384
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,066
- Well, hey, Roxxxy.
- Hi, Ru.

385
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:19,066
- You've done really well with
meeting the challenge head on

386
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,934
with this fearless attitude.

387
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:21,934
Have you always been that way?

388
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,266
- I've always been a competitor.

389
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,800
That's what drove me
to pageants.

390
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,133
- What do you want people to
take away from your experience?

391
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,066
- I came in here wanting to
represent for the big girls,

392
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,734
and, you know, a big girl has
made the top three.

393
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,934
And I think it's time to crown
a thick and juicy kind of girl.

394
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,734
Being a gay man
and being thicker,

395
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,734
it's harder, but I love it.

396
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,333
I'm representing
for the big girls.

397
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,066
I can't wait to make them all
proud of me and, you know,

398
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,533
let them know that,
hey, love yourself.

399
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,333
- You're an amazing queen.
- Thank you.

400
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,066
- You are an amazing queen.
- Oh, my god.

401
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,066
- Thanks, Roxxxy.
- Thank you, Ru, so much.

402
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,100
This isn't a joke to me.

403
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,333
I've had it.

404
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,633
I've fucking had it.

405
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.

406
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:05,100
[laughter]

407
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,633
- We're right about to do our
courtroom scene,

408
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:14,467
directed by Mathu Andersen,
in which we all

409
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,967
have to play three distinctly
different characters:

410
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:22,433
the witness, the defense
attorney, and the prosecutor.

411
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,767
- Ladies, you've been instructed
to create

412
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,166
different characters
for each role.

413
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,400
So blow me away.

414
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,233
Here we go. Action.

415
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,233
- All rise for the honorable
Judge Rudy.

416
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:37,066
- Order in the courtroom,
hunties.

417
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,300
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove

418
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,700
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.

419
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,100
- As the defense attorney, I
would like to submit my briefs.

420
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,133
- Cut.

421
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,934
Alaska, I 'd like to know what
your inspiration

422
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,667
and motivation for your
character at the moment.

423
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,200
- Her name is Peg Hollis.

424
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,967
She smokes two packs of Misty
Slim Menthol 100s

425
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,500
and she's a hard-ass.

426
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,066
She's going on 60.

427
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,333
40 years in the business.

428
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,767
Graduated law school at 20.

429
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:11,900
I don't know how that happened.

430
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,300
[all laugh]

431
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,433
- It's a miscarriage of justice.

432
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,667
[laughs]

433
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,967
- "I smoke 80 packs of Virginia
Slims every day."

434
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm sorry, that's not funny
to me.

435
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,867
- Okay, and action.

436
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:27,066
- Those hideous, uh, drag queens
had it coming.

437
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,266
It was a murd--mercy murder.

438
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,233
- Cut.
- Sorry, I messed that up.

439
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,066
- Taking a deep breath,
and... action.

440
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:38,633
- If I'm guilty of being
anything up in "herrre,"

441
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,133
it's of being fierce.

442
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,700
- And cut. Roxxxy?

443
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,600
- Uh-huh?
- Who are you?

444
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,333
- I'm Roxxxy Andrews.

445
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,834
A ghetto bitch.

446
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:54,800
- Roxxxy's character of Roxxxy
is definitely Tamar Braxton.

447
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,066
- Where my people at?

448
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,700
Where my people at?

449
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,867
- Dot-com.

450
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:00,934
- Okay, ladies.

451
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,066
It's time to do musical chairs

452
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,734
and change into your next
character.

453
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:06,900
Hit the changing rooms.

454
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,633
So here we go.

455
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:12,667
Action.

456
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,734
- Judge Rudy, the prosecution

457
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,700
would like to submit
the murder weapon.

458
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,834
- Objection!

459
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:23,567
Reading the witness.

460
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,433
- You want answers?

461
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:27,567
- We want the "T," stupid.

462
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,066
- You can't handle the "T."

463
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,967
- Jinkx was the most solid
in her characterizations.

464
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,367
She has the leading edge
in this courtroom drama.

465
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,767
And cut.

466
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,233
Big change.

467
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,367
Next role.

468
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,834
Okay, ladies.

469
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,900
I see you're all in different
positions and ready to go...

470
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,967
on action!

471
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:55,300
- Those damn fucking drag queens
had it coming.

472
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,533
- I say, I say--
- Cut, cut, cut, cut.

473
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:57,700
One moment.

474
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,367
Just gonna back up a little bit
because, um...

475
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,467
- I said a bad word.

476
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,700
- You said naughty words.

477
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,834
Action.

478
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:07,033
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.

479
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,867
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove

480
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:13,834
that the accused is one cold,
hard-blooded bitch.

481
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:14,834
Biatch.

482
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,133
- Cut.

483
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,633
Roxxxy, what's the motivation
for your character?

484
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,533
- Uh, actually just a bitch.

485
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,200
- Okay.

486
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,333
Jinkx Monsoon?

487
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,533
- Her name is Daisy A. Irwin

488
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:31,767
and she's a little older than
she tries to pass herself off as

489
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,200
and she's just a simple
Southern lawyer.

490
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,934
- Fantastic. Alaska?

491
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,266
- I hope I don't go to prison,

492
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,734
but if I do,
I hope it's a men's prison.

493
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:42,834
- [laughs]

494
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,033
Okay, really bring it.

495
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:49,200
I want to see Satan,
ancient crone, and...bitch.

496
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
Action!

497
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
- I say, I say, objection.

498
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
- And Alaska?
- What's the line?

499
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,100
- "I can't face it."

500
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,066
- I can't face it.
I can't face it.

501
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,066
[sobs]

502
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,166
- What is it you can't face?

503
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,633
- What did you just call her?

504
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:15,066
- Roxxxy, humor me.

505
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,300
Your spit take
was a bit overly long.

506
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,533
Try and get the water
out of your mouth

507
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,667
so you can get to your line.

508
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,700
- Okay.

509
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
What did you just call her?

510
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,567
- Spit takes are usually a bit
more, "Puh!"

511
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:31,600
Nnn!

512
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,133
- Am I still not doing it right?

513
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,633
- Tight.

514
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,133
It seemed a little bit
problematic for Roxxxy

515
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,266
with the old spit take.

516
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,367
I just need you to snort it out
like a, "Puh!"

517
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,533
"What did you say?"

518
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,900
- I didn't know you wanted me
to say the line.

519
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,100
- You can tell it's really
affecting her

520
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,934
when Mathu calls her out.

521
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,066
The frustration
has gotten to the point

522
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,667
where you can tell she's mad.

523
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,800
- Ladies, guess what.

524
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,667
That's a wrap.

525
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,700
- Whew.

526
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,200
- [groans]

527
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,333
- This isn't even my character
anymore.

528
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,633
I just literally
have the shakes.

529
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:09,667
This day has been so long.

530
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,500
- [laughs]
My brain is completely gone.

531
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,667
- Melted.

532
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,567
- Are you okay, Roxxxy?

533
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,233
- I'm perfectly fine.

534
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,800
- No, you're not. You're upset.

535
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,633
- You guys are comedy girls,
so your spit takes were fine.

536
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,233
Didn't know a courtroom scene
was comedic.

537
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,834
- Girl.

538
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:29,800
It's a courtroom scene
that's written to be funny.

539
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,367
This is not<i> NCIS.</i>

540
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,433
- I take what I do extremely
professional and real

541
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,400
and I don't make a joke
out of everything.

542
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,533
And they're gonna read me 'cause
I'm lost

543
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,533
because there's
so much bullshit going on.

544
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,934
So trying to sell comedy,
trying to sell comedy,

545
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:46,667
trying to outdo each other--

546
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,934
I know what I've done
and I've--

547
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,667
I-I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.

548
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,367
I'm sick of the gimmicks.

549
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,567
I feel that America's next
drag superstar

550
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,166
should take her career a little
more serious

551
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,700
than completely joking
all the fucking time.

552
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,667
I'm so--I've had it.
I've fucking had it.

553
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,700
This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think you--

554
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,066
- This competition
is extremely serious

555
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,500
and it's the rest of my life.

556
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,834
Girl, I'm over it.

557
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,767
Why do I have to make up a name
to who I'm doing?

558
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,834
I'm acting like an attorney.
A bitch.

559
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,066
Why do I have to have some kind
of fucking character?

560
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,066
"Well, I'm so and so.

561
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,266
And I do this
and I'm 80 years old."

562
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,400
No, you're not 80 years old.

563
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,633
You're Jinkx Monsoon
playing a character.

564
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,867
- Roxxxy has admitted
to me before

565
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,533
that she's lashed out at me

566
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,900
when she's felt insecure
with her performance.

567
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,500
And she's obviously
doing it again.

568
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,333
- I'm just frustrated with this
whole fucking competition.

569
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:39,800
- I'm sorry if you missed the
mark on this challenge,

570
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,066
but stop trying to blame
everyone else

571
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,834
when you don't do well.

572
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:52,300
- The time has come for you
to defend your life.

573
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,767
[laughter]

574
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,266
- Ah!

575
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,433
- It's the last time we're gonna
see this place.

576
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12,100
It's the final day.

577
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,467
And I just want to soak up this
experience

578
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,967
for everything it's worth.

579
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,867
- How did you guys feel
about yesterday?

580
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:18,967
- Yeah. Um--
- You know--

581
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:20,233
- I know I had a breakdown,

582
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:22,467
but the buffoonery that was
going on in that room?

583
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:25,233
All of our characters
are not supposed to be funny.

584
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,233
- Yes, they are.
- I think they were.

585
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,567
- No, they're not.

586
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,266
- I love how you say, "comedy,"
like it's a bad thing.

587
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,867
- Well, honey,
not all drag is comedy.

588
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,400
- I take comedy very seriously.

589
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,900
Comedy is not poking fun
at drag.

590
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,100
Like, comedy's--

591
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,967
- Well, it's not funny to me.

592
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:45,066
And the fact that drag continues
to get insulted

593
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,533
in this competition
is not funny to me.

594
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,934
They're making fun of drag.

595
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,166
I take my drag very seriously

596
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,567
and I look good
from head to toe.

597
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,600
Not in the same shoes
since day one.

598
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,433
Not in the same wig
since day one.

599
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,667
Sorry, I change it up.

600
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,200
- So what has been
your favorite moment

601
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,166
throughout this competition?

602
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:08,600
- Seeing you in the bottom two.

603
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,066
- I just don't get
what's so rewarding

604
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,800
about being hurtful like that.

605
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,734
- I'm not being hurtful.
I'm being truthful.

606
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:18,633
You asked me.
I gave you an answer.

607
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,934
You skated through this whole
competition.

608
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,800
- For you to just discredit
all my work,

609
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,667
it just shows how immature
and bitter you are.

610
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,700
- I can't hear you.

611
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,233
I'm blow-drying my hair.

612
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:33,633
- I would never discredit
your form of drag.

613
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,700
- Huh?

614
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,133
- It doesn't make me feel good

615
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:43,600
to talk to other people the way
you talk to me sometimes.

616
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,433
- I know, you're the victim.

617
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,467
Everybody hates you and nobody
gets you and--

618
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:49,800
- I'm not a victim.

619
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,066
I've been very strong throughout
this competition.

620
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:55,500
- Roxxxy's a pageant girl,
and those pageant girls

621
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,700
play some wicked mind games
backstage.

622
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,867
- I know it's gonna get under
her skin.

623
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,800
I want her going in tonight
bothered.

624
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,300
Jinkx is competition to me and

625
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm gonna do anything to get her
off her track.

626
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,867
- Victims blame other people
when they don't do well.

627
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:14,066
- You're getting all angry and--

628
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,233
- I have done well
in this competition

629
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:18,834
and I love what I do,
so I am not angry.

630
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,333
- This was the gas that I needed
for tonight.

631
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:25,166
I'm ready to tell the judges why
these two jokes should go home.

632
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,433
They have no idea what's coming
to this runway.

633
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,133
I'm here to win America's next
drag superstar,

634
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,266
and I'm going for blood.

635
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,500
- Alaska, what's been your
favorite part

636
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,667
of this competition?

637
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,367
- Seeing you in the bottom two.

638
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:40,066
[laughs]

639
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,300
- [laughter]

640
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,400
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

641
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Hey, judges.

642
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,066
Tonight, it's just family.

643
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,967
Michelle Visage,
can I get a witness?

644
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,066
- Of course.
You got one right here.

645
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,567
- Santino Rice, any objections?

646
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,834
- Just one, Ru.

647
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,834
You are looking too damn fine
tonight.

648
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,166
- Oh.
- [laughs]

649
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:23,266
- Objection!
Ass-kissing overruled.

650
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,767
- For their final challenge,
our queens starred

651
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:29,600
in the official music video
for my latest single,<i> </i>

652
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,734
<i>The Beginning.</i>

653
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,533
And tonight, they're ready
to hit the runway

654
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,533
in their very best drag

655
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:39,066
as they prepare
to defend their lives.

656
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,767
Are you ready for some justice
to be served?

657
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,166
- Bring it.
- Ready.

658
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:47,066
- Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.

659
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:53,533
- First up, the queen
on everybody's lips,

660
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,667
Roxxxy Andrews.

661
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,367
- Ooh!
- Glamour.

662
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,100
- This is my last time walking
this runway

663
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,133
and I'm feeling
so good right now.

664
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,066
The dress is stone
from head to toe.

665
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,133
I'm giving them a little bit
of my hair.

666
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,867
I'm feeling absolutely
glamorous.

667
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,166
- Foxy Roxxxy.

668
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,266
- She must have just come
from Paisley Park.

669
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:14,700
- Where my Paisley at?

670
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,467
- [laughs]

671
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:19,467
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.

672
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:20,900
- Aww.

673
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,200
- Fairy tale come to life.

674
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,867
- Very<i> Princess Bride.</i>

675
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,333
- It is.

676
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,233
- I am exuding beauty
from within.

677
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:32,367
I want them to see how gorgeous
and proud I feel.

678
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,300
- Like, it's soft, earthy Jinkx.

679
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,367
- She's a real
Renaissance woman.

680
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,367
- What kind of sauce
is Renee sauce?

681
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,800
- Ooh, it's good
on some chicken.

682
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,834
- Mmm.

683
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:44,600
- Up next, 49th state, Alaska.

684
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,133
High fash-i-on.

685
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,367
- That's what she's giving you.

686
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,100
- Yes, she's giving some fear up
in here.

687
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,333
- I'm coming down the runway

688
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,100
and I'm looking like a high
fashion ghoul

689
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,800
and I feel lovely.

690
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,367
- Oh, she got some booty today.

691
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,400
- Oh, yeah.

692
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,367
That's what she got
from her mama.

693
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,066
She's wearing
a lace front dress.

694
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,567
[all laugh]

695
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,300
Welcome, ladies.

696
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,533
The judges' final critique
is now in session.

697
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:18,266
Let's take a look
at the evidence.

698
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:22,233
- As the defense attorney, I 'd
like to submit my briefs.

699
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:25,066
- The state accuses Roxxxy
Andrews

700
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:29,400
of deplorable acts
of slayin' bitches.

701
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,934
- I plead guilty of being
devastatingly beautiful.

702
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:45,533
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.

703
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,567
It was a mercy killing.

704
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:51,200
- The evidence
will prove beyond a doubt

705
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,266
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.

706
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,700
- Objection!

707
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,467
Reading the witness!

708
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:10,567
- The prosecution would like
to submit the murder weapon.

709
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,834
A size three stiletto.

710
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,667
- But I wear a size 14.

711
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:21,600
- If the pup don't fit,
you must acquit.

712
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,233
- [laughs]

713
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,367
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

714
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,266
[laughter]

715
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:46,100
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

716
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,633
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.

717
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,367
- Tonight, you look fantastic.

718
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,600
And what's been really exciting,
Roxxxy,

719
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,734
is seeing you come in
as a pageant queen

720
00:30:55,734 --> 00:31:01,567
and you leave as a fully
rounded--pardon the pun--queen.

721
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,500
- In that video,
you exuded sex appeal.

722
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,233
Your hairography was on point.

723
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,667
Then in the courtroom scene,
there was a point where

724
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,467
some of the characters started
to blend a little bit for me.

725
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,967
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.

726
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:18,934
- You gave so many different,
varied performances.

727
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:20,600
Tyler Perry better watch out.

728
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,767
- I think her head piece tonight
is adorable,

729
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,500
but the dress
is just not my favorite.

730
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,400
It's very prom-ish. Very '80s.

731
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,066
- But your face looks amazing.

732
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:32,433
And you moved like you feel
beautiful tonight.

733
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,800
- All right, next up, Alaska.

734
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,967
Hi-eee!
- Hi-eee!

735
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,700
- Tonight, I really loved this
look on you.

736
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,133
The courtroom, your characters
were realized,

737
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,066
thought out, and you may not
be the strongest dancer,

738
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,333
but I think you made it work.

739
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:48,533
I don't know if I would have
chosen an afro.

740
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,834
- You had a lot to live up to.

741
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:53,600
And I think now you're--you're
not in anyone's shadow.

742
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,066
You're standing as Alaska.

743
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,567
You're your own queen.

744
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,433
- You've made so many of my
dreams come true being here.

745
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,066
It means everything to me.

746
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,567
Thank you.

747
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,800
- Thank you.

748
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,667
Ladies, now we are ready
for your closing arguments.

749
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,400
Convince me
and everyone watching

750
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,667
why you deserve to be America's
next drag superstar.

751
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:22,934
The time has come for you
to defend your life.

752
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:26,500
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.

753
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,467
- The reason I should be
America's next drag superstar?

754
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,667
What they don't have, I do have.

755
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:36,200
I have grace, I have beauty,
I have professionalism.

756
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,133
I want to be a person that kids
look up to.

757
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:43,934
I am a thick and juicy girl,
and that makes me so proud.

758
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:46,066
I could never let you down.

759
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:49,533
And I will be one hell
of a superstar.

760
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,066
- Thank you, Roxxxy.

761
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:52,667
Jinkx Monsoon.

762
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:56,567
- Growing up, I was continually
an outcast,

763
00:32:56,567 --> 00:33:00,433
and in my teen years,
I discovered drag.

764
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:05,800
So even though I was hurting
at home, I was living onstage.

765
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,166
My whole life, I've danced
to the beat of a different drum.

766
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:13,934
And when I came here, I took
the critiques and I was able to

767
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:18,600
adapt and grow while still being
true to who I am as a performer.

768
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,500
And anything else was just water
off a duck's back.

769
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,867
- [laughs]

770
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,834
- Thank you, Jinkx.

771
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,266
- Um, can I say something else?

772
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:31,367
- What's on your mind?

773
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,900
- I said something to Jinkx
earlier today that I just--

774
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,133
it has nothing
to do with the runway,

775
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,667
but I want to apologize to her.

776
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,066
I really didn't mean that,
and I really do love you.

777
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,533
I love you.

778
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,266
- Thank you, Roxxxy.

779
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:49,233
Last, but not least, Alaska.

780
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,533
- When it comes
to pleading our case,

781
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,934
Roxxxy and Jinkx totally
copped out.

782
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,400
We're supposed to say
why the other queens

783
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,700
shouldn't be America's
next drag superstar.

784
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,166
My name is Alaska,
and I am hungry

785
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,667
to be America's next drag
superstar.

786
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,633
Not hungry.

787
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:10,100
I'm practically starving.

788
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,767
As for my fellow competitors
tonight, Roxxxy was faced

789
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:17,100
with a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.

790
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,734
What did she present?

791
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:22,800
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.

792
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
And Jinkx Monsoon.

793
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,166
During the Sugar Ball,
she failed not just one,

794
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,633
not just two, but three
different looks.

795
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:36,667
I am the queen who takes the
tragic and turns it into magic.

796
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,867
I take trash and turn it into
treasure.

797
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:42,700
And having never fallen
into the bottom two,

798
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I am Alaska and I am America's
next drag superstar!

799
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,967
Thank you.

800
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,066
- Wow.

801
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,300
Thank you, Alaska.

802
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
And thank you, ladies.

803
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,567
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the Interior

804
00:34:56,567 --> 00:35:00,333
Illusions Lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.

805
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,800
You may leave the stage.

806
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,133
All right, now, just between us
girls, what do you think?

807
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,400
Let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.

808
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,667
- Roxxxy is the embodiment
of a superstar.

809
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,934
In the music video, she whipped
that hair.

810
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,066
- She a video ho.

811
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,467
- She's thick and juicy.

812
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,867
She--she owns it
and she's come up

813
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:24,266
with some pretty amazing looks
this season.

814
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,800
- She comes from the pageant
world of drag.

815
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,266
To go from that
to this competition,

816
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:31,467
she's a fully-rounded
entertainer.

817
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,400
Jinkx Monsoon.

818
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,066
- Unlike Roxxxy, Jinkx does not
care at all what she looks like

819
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,900
and will go completely
into a character.

820
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
- She's in love with her craft.

821
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,333
And you see it
in everything she does,

822
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,834
but her style is--is lacking.

823
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:49,300
- But if we saw Carol Burnett
out at a red carpet event

824
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,066
and she looked a hot mess,
are you even gonna care?

825
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,066
- She talked about dancing to
the beat of a different drummer

826
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,300
and that's something each of us
on this panel right now

827
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,767
can relate to.

828
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,967
Miss Alaska.

829
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,900
- The cards were stacked
against her.

830
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,533
I love that she's persevered
through that.

831
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,967
- Alaska's got a really great,
sick, twisted sense of humor.

832
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,533
I like that she was able
to drop down that wall.

833
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:14,800
Mr. Gorbachev,
knock down that wall.

834
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,967
- [laughs]

835
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,166
- And when she gave us more
vulnerability,

836
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,800
I loved her even more.

837
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,867
Her defend-your-life speech
was the best.

838
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:24,533
- Well, they worked
with Gloria Allred.

839
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,100
- But she was the only one
out of the three

840
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,066
that read the other two.

841
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,166
- Yeah.

842
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,400
- It was actually part
of the assignment.

843
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,500
- Yes.

844
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,367
- Alaska has evolved
understanding the power,

845
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,834
not only of drag,
but the power of Alaska.

846
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,166
They're all so different.

847
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,400
Let's just break it down.

848
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,200
This week, Roxxxy really rocked
the music video,

849
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,333
Jinkx excelled
at the courtroom scene,

850
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,633
and when it came
to defending her life,

851
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,166
Alaska had the upper hand.

852
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,867
Damn, this is a photo finish.

853
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,367
- Hell, yeah.

854
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,967
- Silence!

855
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,767
Bring back my girls.

856
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,100
[laughter]

857
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,734
Welcome back, ladies.

858
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:10,266
Only one of you will be named
America's next drag superstar

859
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:14,800
and walk away with a prize
package that includes a crown

860
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,166
designed by Fierce Drag Jewels
and a cash prize...

861
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:24,300
of $100,000.

862
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,500
Now, based on your performance
in this week's final challenge

863
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,266
and throughout the season,
each of you

864
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:36,834
has earned the right
to lip-sync for your life.

865
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,066
- I have never lip-synced
for my life before, and now

866
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:46,500
I have to lip-sync against two
other queens for $100,000.

867
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,867
Help me, Mommy.

868
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:53,567
- Three amazing queens
stand before me.

869
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:57,266
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

870
00:37:57,266 --> 00:38:00,667
and prove to the world

871
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,900
that you are America's
next drag superstar.

872
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:11,100
- This is the last chance
to show ourselves to Ru,

873
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,066
the judges, and the whole world.

874
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,567
- I'm so ready for this.

875
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:15,967
I'm ready to dance,
I'm ready to show them

876
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,600
why I should be America's
next drag superstar.

877
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,834
It's what I'm here for.

878
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,367
- Good luck.

879
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,700
And don't fuck it up.

This is the beginning

917
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,734
- Wow. [laughs]

918
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,667
Ladies...

919
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,266
I have not made my final
decision.

920
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:16,667
The race is that close.

921
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,900
And like last year, the crown

922
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,700
could still go
to any one of you.

923
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,300
Now I need the help of<i> Drag Race</i>
fans everywhere.

924
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,066
Based on all the evidence,
who do you think

925
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:33,000
should be America's next
drag superstar?

926
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,734
Is it Alaska?

927
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,967
Jinkx Monsoon?

928
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,667
Or Roxxxy Andrews?

929
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:44,500
Tweet your top choice
to @rupaulsdragrace

930
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,700
using #dragrace.

931
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Then go to the<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Facebook page.</i>

932
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,433
Then go to Instagram, Tumblr,
Pinterest, the Wow Report

933
00:40:57,433 --> 00:41:01,467
and GetGlue to make sure your
voice is heard.

934
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:05,734
And then turn off
your goddamn computer

935
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,700
and go walk, children,
in nature.

936
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,066
Next week, tune in
for surprising revelations

937
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:18,066
and unseen footage of the final
three, including the debut

938
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:20,300
of their music video,
<i>The Beginning.</i>

939
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,734
And in two weeks,
we will announce the winner

940
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,433
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>

941
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:30,133
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

942
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,600
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

943
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,300
Can I get a "Amen" in here?

944
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,600
all: Amen!

945
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,834
- [laughs]

946
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,834
Now let the music play.

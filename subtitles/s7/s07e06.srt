{\an8}You're invited to the first annual DESPYS.

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:13,279
{\an8}-Pearl, I want you to up the ante.
-Well, you told me I had no personality.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,948
{\an8}That doesn't give me confidence.

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,019
{\an8}I'm just over this bullshit.

5
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:27,060
We want to welcome... welcome you
to the first annual Despy Awards.

6
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:32,465
And the award
for the shadiest shade goes to...

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,234
Violet Chachki.

8
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,105
The winner is Max and Pearl.

9
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,041
[applause]

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,912
-Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
-Thank you.

11
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,149
Mrs. Kasha Davis, sashay away.

12
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,227
{\an8}-Whoo! Shit.
-[Pearl] Single digits!

13
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,597
{\an8}"Love to the moon &amp; back, MKD."

14
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:10,070
{\an8}They're putting me on the bottom
so that I can take out the other girls.

15
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,106
{\an8}-I took out the two oldest ones.
-[laughter]

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,608
{\an8}Ru gave me another chance.

17
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:21,047
{\an8}So I'm just gonna have to go crazy,
untuck, and act a fool.

18
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,150
So who is everybody
that had won in the categories?

19
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,119
-I won!
-Me.

20
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,189
The award that was so unexpected
was Violet.

21
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,892
Shady lady!
How do you feel about winning that award?

22
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,929
-You know, I was kind of expecting it.
-[Miss Fame] Yeah, me too.

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,268
{\an8}People think I'm mean, but everything
I've done comes from humor or truth.

24
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,639
I want you to know that I am gonna work
on the way I come across.

25
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,141
I won't hold my breath.

26
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,509
[laughter]

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,382
-Well, congrats to Max and Pearl.
-[Ginger] Yes, congratulations!

28
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,386
Girl, how do you feel?
'Cause I know you were having a meltdown.

29
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,357
-No, I was not feeling it today.
-I could tell.

30
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,028
[Miss Fame] <i>I was not expecting</i>
<i>Pearl to pull through that strong.</i>

31
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:16,369
{\an8}I'm frustrated, I'm grateful to be here,
and she's like "Fuck this. I'm out."

32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:21,274
The energy is so toxic. I can't
shower positive energy on that shit.

33
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,211
I don't even want it near me.

Looks like the Pit Crew invited
some of their friends over for a playdate.

68
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,901
I'm gonna pass out.

It's like Epcot for the thirsty bitches.

72
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:44,550
For today's challenge, we're gonna play
a game called Monster in Your Pants.

[laughter]

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,159
Most of these men have a number tucked
inside their Justin Case underwear.

75
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:59,198
You call out a name, he reaches
into his drawers and whips it out.

76
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,271
You'll need to gobble up
as many points as possible.

77
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:10,710
But be careful, because one of you
bastards has a Monster in Your Pants.

78
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,649
If you pick the monster before you freeze
your points, you're out of the game.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,086
All right, first up.
Come on over, Miss Fame.

80
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,890
[RuPaul]
The rest wait outside for your turn.

81
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,427
-Miss Fame, call out a name.
-I'm gonna go with Dick.

82
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,263
Everybody loves Dick. Ten!

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,733

-Yay! I'm gonna go with Jack.

We're off to a good start.

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,116

{\an8}I've no idea what the rules are.
I don't care what they are.

93
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,728
{\an8}Just, when do I get to blow them?
I can't say that?

94
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,995
{\an8}I can't say that either?

95
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,864
-Katya, call out a name.
-Okay.

96
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,201
-Dude.
-[RuPaul] Show us what you got.

97
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:13,906
Motherfucker! God. Son of a motherfucking
cunt whore bitch. The first time?

98
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,775
[RuPaul] The first time out?

99
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,679
I love me some BJ, but I'll go with Papi.

100
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,383
-[Ru] Two and a half.
-Rod. Come on, come on.

101
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,018
-Oh, Rod.
-Oh, no!

102
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,920
-BJ.
-Fang.

103
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,222
John.

104
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,458
[Ru] Oh, shoot!

105
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,227
-Rod.
-Nine!

106
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,597
-Mary.
-Eight and a half!

107
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,199
-Jack.
-Whip it out, Jack!

108
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,802
- Ooh, girl!
-I think I wanna freeze.

109
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,070
-You wanna freeze.
-Yes.

110
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,705
All right.

111
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,308
Pearl, this may be your chance
to finally get that necklace.

112
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,979
-Jack.
-Six and a half.

113
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,347
Fang.

114
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,715
-Nine!
-Yes!

115
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,650
-Who's talking to you?
-Pete.

116
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,056
Fuck you, Pete. Fuck you, Pete.

117
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:09,729
All right, time to get that blood
rushing right back up to your brains.

118
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:16,469
The one queen that inched
her way to victory is... Ginger Minj.

119
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,304
[cheers and applause]

120
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:25,878
{\an8}For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll act in the reenactment series

121
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,149
{\an8}#RuHollywoodStories.

122
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,320
{\an8}This week's episode,
Whatever Happened to Merle Ginsberg?

123
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:42,128
Y'all remember Merle? She sat
by my side for the first two seasons.

124
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:48,968
I could almost see her now.
So soft, so wise, so blurry.

125
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:56,042
In teams of three, you'll portray
Merle, myself, and Michelle Visage,

126
00:07:56,108 --> 00:08:00,279
as you reenact our very different versions

127
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,315
of what ha-happened?

128
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:07,353
Ginger Minj, you won the mini challenge
so you get to pick your two teammates.

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,823
Kennedy Davenport and Katya.

130
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,461
And then you get to assign
the other two groups.

131
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,164
Max, Violet, and Kandy.

132
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:23,936
Ginger knows Violet and Kandy
have not been the strongest.

133
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,239
Regardless,
I am gonna whip 'em into shape.

134
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:33,513
And that means team three
is Miss Fame, Jaidynn, and Pearl.

135
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,250
God damn it, me and Pearl again.
I'm frustrated.

136
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,522
Now listen, I need you to break
this mystery wide open.

137
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:48,594
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

138
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,400
You wanna roll through it so we get
the hang of it and don't mess up?

139
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,903
What if we were doing
like a three-way scissor?

140
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:04,176
Or like a triangle toenail clipping?
Or like a toenail polishing thing?

141
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,512
Okay.

142
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,181
{\an8}Pearl was having a good time.

143
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,318
"What if we did this?"
I'm like, "What if we learn our lines?"

144
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,356
What I would like to do,
just kind of start acting stuff out

145
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,559
so it gets in our brains and stuff.

146
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:24,497
I ain't trying to look a fool again and go
home 'cause you wanna do a stunt.

147
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,400
'Cause I just don't wanna bomb this,
'cause we gotta win.

148
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,606
We gotta have fun because there's nothing
to this but being completely nonsensical.

149
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:38,744
{\an8}For our maxi challenge this week,
we will reenact the Ru Hollywood Story of,

150
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,247
What the Hell Ever Happened
to Merle Ginsberg?

151
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,251
-Okay, so how do we feel about characters?
-I don't know.

152
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,921
{\an8}I'm a little bit over
these acting group challenges.

153
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:54,293
{\an8}I'm sick of memorizing lines and lyrics,
and working with other people.

154
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,429
I'm not really comfortable playing Ru.

155
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,131
-Do you want Merle?
-I was comfortable with Michelle.

156
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,734
-'Cause I could do the Jersey thing.
-The Merle--

157
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,972
That one's off for me
because I do not know nothing about her.

158
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,142
The attitude shouldn't be,
"I don't know how to do this,"

159
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,813
or "I'm uncomfortable with it."
They need to be positive and excited.

160
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,114
It's like...

161
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,787
Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,424
-Ru and I are great friends.
-Well, I'm her best friend, okay?

163
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,562
And I'm supposed to be a judge here.
You got it, Merly girl?

164
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,232
{\an8}Ginger is gonna be the evil villain,
which is perfect,

165
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,269
{\an8}because she's playing it
like Ginger Minj as Danny Devito

166
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,741
as Tony Soprano as The Fonz
as Michelle Visage.

167
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,411
Hey, Merle, how's my cake?
Don't you want sprinkles?

168
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,982
So I have to find a way
to not get overshadowed by Ginger.

169
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,021
-Hello, hello, hello!
-[all] Hi!

170
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:02,194
In a moment, you'll meet with Ross Mathews
who will be directing your Ru-enactments.

171
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:07,833
And tomorrow, for the runway,
category is... Death Becomes Her.

172
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,971
-Now a warning?!
-[laughter]

173
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:17,877
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

174
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,987
{\an8}-Ginger, Kennedy, Katya, how are you?
-[all] Good. Good.

175
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,122
-Who's gonna play RuPaul?
-Me.

176
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,491
-It's just a joke, honey.
-[laughter]

177
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,760
-I figured that out.
-[Kennedy] Right.

178
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,562
You're doing Merle's story.

179
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,799
-I'm ready.
-Okay, places!

180
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,302
-Action!
-Good-bye, Merle?

181
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,906
But I'm not going anywhere.
Ru and I are great friends.

182
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,809
Well, I'm her best friend, see?

183
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,446
Ru, I brought you a cake.

184
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,083
All the brothers will like-- I'm sorry.

185
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,651
It's all right, honey.

186
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,988
All the brothers will wanna eat this cake.

187
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,491
Speaking of,

188
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,295
I have to go speak to the new Pit Crew.

189
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,197
Cut!

190
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,099
That was a little rocky.

191
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,103
Kennedy's RuPaul
was the weirdest fucking thing ever.

192
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,506
You have job security

193
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,144
for the rest of your life!

194
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,479
That was like...

195
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,549
{\an8}I am just sending up
a silent prayer at this point

196
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:35,054
<i>that we do not get dragged down</i>
<i>into the bottom because of her.</i>

197
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,859
-Hello, team two.
-Hello.

198
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,162
-Hi, Ross.
-Places!

199
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,064
Okay, ready.

200
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,569
-Max, this is how you see Merle?
-It's not how I see Merle.

201
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:54,473
-But it's Michelle's side of the story.
-So thought behind this performance.

202
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,843
-Oh, of course.
-Yeah, you are the Meryl Streep of drag.

203
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,348
-Action.
-You can have my job, tramp!

204
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,885
Because I'm taking RuPaul's!

205
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,153
What?!

206
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,491
Um, let's cut. So on your, "What?"
you should be like, "What?"

207
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,862
Upset about it, grab your drink,
take a sip to calm yourself down.

208
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,830
-Okay.
-[Ross] Right?

209
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,267
I'm supposed to hold a cake and a drink
while I do all of this?

210
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,135
No one said it was easy.

211
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,774
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!

212
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,810
Mother--

213
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,245
-Can I get my line?
-Mother does not play that.

214
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,982
-Mother does not play!
-That.

215
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,084
-Oh, play that.
-Play that.

216
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,022
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!

217
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,891
Mother does not play!

218
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,793
-That.
-Fuck.

219
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,095
Let's do it again.

220
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,230
Shit.

221
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,435
-Look at you.
-Hi, Ross Mathews.

222
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,005
-Your scene today is RuPaul's story.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.

223
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,942
-So a lot rests on your shoulders.
-I know.

224
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,444
Okay, let's get in positions.

225
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,012
Action.

226
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,249
You two are crazy!

227
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,452
I forgot my line!

228
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,589
{\an8}I got frustrated.
And then next thing you know...

229
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,425
Get the crazy one and...

230
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,561
I'm just forgetting all my lines.

231
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,499
RuPaul, my monkeys
made you this potato salad.

232
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:32,004
Yay, I love a strong--
I don't know the line.

233
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,474
Yay, I love emotional time travel movies
with a strong female lead.

234
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,745
Yay, I love a strong female lead.
I love a--

235
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,081
I'm so struggling right now, to be honest.

236
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,184
-What's the struggle?
-This is the toughest day I've had.

237
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,989
I like to be professional,
and this is just embarrassing for me.

238
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,758
-I hear you.
-I  want to do better than this.

239
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,027
And I'm hitting a wall.

240
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,732
I wanna talk real, I'm in a room of people
and this is a chance of a lifetime.

241
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,502
And I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.

242
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,907
{\an8}Miss Fame decides to stop everything.

243
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,310
Just say the fucking line!

244
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,514
I have not been to this place before
so I'm trying to...

245
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,450
-It's fine. Just be funny.
-I don't know what's better.

246
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,254
Should I not talk about my feelings
or should I just keep moving on?

247
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,456
Oh, my god. I feel like I'm dating you.

248
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,557
[Ross laughs]

249
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,395
-We'll talk later.
-We just gotta get through this scene.

250
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,598
{\an8}I don't want to disappoint
anybody that's believed in me.

251
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,636
I don't want to make RuPaul disappointed
that I'm here because I'm not producing,

252
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:42,541
'cause I care a lot about my success.

253
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,917
{\an8}-Let's do it. Let's do it, do it, do it.
-[Pearl] Let's get this party started.

254
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:57,589
{\an8}Our runway look is Death Becomes Her.
How would your drag character die?

255
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,828
Girl, that is open to interpretation.
I want to see what these bitches pull out.

256
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,438
{\an8}For my Death Becomes Her look,
I'm going to be--

257
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,340
{\an8}Gee, I don't know what I'm gonna be.

258
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,510
Maybe burned and...

259
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,717
I kind of morphosize into a glamazon,
but before that,

260
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,719
it's, like, a night of hooking.

261
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,289
[laughs]

262
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,459
Katya, how did your family feel
about doing drag?

263
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,029
They're amazing. I never had
to worry about it or feel self-conscious.

264
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,666
-Girl, I wish my mama would be like that.
-What's she like, Jaidynn?

265
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,502
Me and my mama are, like, best friends.

266
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,438
-But it's just kind of hard because--
-Of the drag?

267
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,841
Not really the drag thing.
It's just sexuality.

268
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,679
{\an8}I have not officially
come out to my family yet.

269
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,148
We just kind of ignore the issue.

270
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,884
They're okay with the drag,
but not with the gay?

271
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,720
They're not really okay with the drag.
They know I do it.

272
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,424
My mom kind of lets me know,
"No, you ain't going in that direction."

273
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:11,430
She'll send me a text like, "I'm grateful
that one day you'll find you a wife."

274
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:18,604
It's hard because I love my family,
and my biggest fear is being disowned.

275
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,839
-Yeah.
-[Violet] And that's a real fear.

276
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,375
-It's, like, a serious fear.
-[Jaidynn] Yeah.

277
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,047
I think it may change my relationship

278
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,849
with my brothers, my mom,
and that's what I'm scared of most.

279
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,754
And that's the reason why I just...

280
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,424
stay to myself.

281
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,028
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:50,636
I don't want to live without my family.
I love my family too much.

283
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,105
-You know what I'm saying?
-Totally.

284
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,408
It's just crazy to not be able
to be your authentic self.

285
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,676
Even in your home.

286
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,947
And it's either,
I'll just live my life and marry a woman

287
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,984
and do what my family wants me to do
and be unhappy, or I can do me.

288
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,488
-So it's one of the two.
-Well then, do you and be happy.

289
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,858
[sighs] It's just a complicated thing.

290
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,129
In the end,
I just want to be accepted for who I am.

291
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:22,634
And I want people to know
that gay is okay. [sighs]

-[RuPaul] She's bringing bear back.

321
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,792
[Merle] You go, growl.

322
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,562
{\an8}[RuPaul]
LaGuardia Newark, Kennedy Davenport.

323
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,398
- Kennedy Fried Chicken.
- Is she a chicken or a horse?

324
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,866
[Merle] Giddyap, girl.

325
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,637
[Kennedy] <i>After a night of hooking,</i>
<i>I got attacked, thrown in the fire</i>

326
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,372
<i>and crystallized.</i>

327
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:45,510
<i>So I come out</i>
<i>a fierce glamazon drag queen, honey.</i>

328
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,981
[RuPaul] A morality tale:
Do not go to Tijuana for plastic surgery.

329
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,148
[Merle] No.

330
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,251
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Max.
-[Ariana] Pretty.

331
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,152
{\an8}[Merle] The ghost of drag present.

332
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,056
[Max] <i>I'm doing a jilted lover</i>
<i>that's stuck in purgatory as a ghost</i>

333
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,994
<i>because she committed suicide</i>
<i>by cutting out her own heart. It's tragic.</i>

334
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,197
[RuPaul]
A little club soda'll take that right out.

335
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,767
-[Merle] That's a heart-stopping look.
-[RuPaul] Organ donor realness.

336
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,272
{\an8}[RuPaul]
Kandy Ho. Queen of the damned.

337
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,240
[Merle] I vant to smell your veave.

338
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:20,345
[Kandy] <i>I am feeling fierce right now.</i>
<i>I'm just a sexy vampire.</i>

339
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,648
[RuPaul] I think she was fang banged
to death.

340
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,682
[Michelle] If she's lucky.

341
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,152
[Merle]
Kristen Stewart is eating her heart out.

342
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,221
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-[Michelle] Oh!

343
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,024
{\an8}-[RuPaul] What's running through her head?
-[Ariana] Living.

344
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,961
[Fame] <i>I've been captured by the bride</i>
<i>of the man that I had an affair with.</i>

345
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,397
<i>And bitch got me</i>
<i>with a blade through the skull.</i>

346
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,198
[Merle] She's got a splitting headache.

347
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,335
[RuPaul] The last time
I'll eat at Benihana.

348
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,903
{\an8}[RuPaul] Pearl. Oh!

349
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,372
{\an8}[Merle] My safe word is "whiplash."

350
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,374
[Michelle] Walking's difficult
with the new legs.

351
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:54,079
[Pearl] <i>I'm feeling like all of my bones</i>
<i>are gonna give out at any given moment</i>

352
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,517
<i>and some poor janitor</i>
<i>is gonna have to sweep up my cremains.</i>

353
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,520
[Ross] You should really stop
at the second face-lift.

354
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,754
It's quite enough.

355
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,724
[Michelle]
At least she had the ribs removed.

356
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,995
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Michelle] Orange is the new drag.

357
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,730
[Merle] She's looking really ripped.

358
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:17,969
[Jaidynn] <i>I got in jail, and then I tried</i>
<i>to escape to go see my baby daddy.</i>

359
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,505
<i>And I didn't quite make it over the fence.</i>

360
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,075
[Ross] It's criminal to look that good.

361
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:28,480
[RuPaul] She rises from the dead
once a month to meet her parole officer.

362
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,483
{\an8}Violet Chachki. [gasps]

363
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,018
Oh, my God.

364
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,589
[Violet] <i>I'm numb from the waist down,</i>
<i>tuck included.</i>

365
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,125
<i>I really could die, bitch.</i>
<i>I'm giving you realness.</i>

366
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,494
[Merle]
She's got a smaller waist than Barbie.

367
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,896
[Ross]
Don't sneeze, honey. It's all gonna pop.

368
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,665
[Ariana] Amazing. Work!

369
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,500
♪ <i>Now, sissy that walk </i> ♪

370
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:54,373
Ladies, let's watch my favorite new show,
Ru Hollywood Stories.

371
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,109
First up, Merle's story.

372
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,780
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>

373
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,484
I'm Merle Ginsberg, and this is my story.

374
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,654
{\an8}[Merle] <i>I was at the craft service table</i>
<i>getting my morning martini,</i>

375
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,923
<i>and I spotted RuPaul and said,</i>

376
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,429
<i>"Hey, Rusy-Q,</i>
<i>I'm so glad to be back for Season 3."</i>

377
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:23,268
And RuPaul said, "Oh, Merly girl,
I could never do the show without you."

378
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,672
You have job security
for the rest of your life.

379
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,778
Little did I know that we were not alone.

380
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,213
[clears throat]

381
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,083
Oh, my God, you scared me.
I didn't see you there.

382
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,119
Not very observant for a judge, bitch.

383
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,991
Ru, I brought you a cake.

384
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,528
All of the brothers
will want to eat this cake.

385
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:54,866
Speaking of,
I need to say hey to the new Pit Crew.

386
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,869
[Katya] Good-bye, Merle?

387
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,807
But I'm not going anywhere
Ru and I are great friends.

388
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:07,112
Well, I'm her best friend, see?
And I'm supposed to be a judge here!

389
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,714
<i>Someone slipped something in my drink</i>

390
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,818
<i>because I could not believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>

391
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:18,223
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.

392
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,097
[grunting and screaming]

393
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:33,038
What in the name of La Toya Jackson
is going on here?

394
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,508
Merle fell and I think she bumped
that part of her brain.

395
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,444
Now she can't judge good drag from bad.

396
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,080
But we're supposed
to be shooting Season 3.

397
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:46,685
I guess I'll just have to take her place.

398
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,454
[laughs]

399
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:55,627
And that's how that devil bitch,
Michelle Visage, stole my job.

400
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,001
Next up, Michelle's story.

401
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,838
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>

402
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,209
I'm Michelle Visage,
and here's what really happened.

403
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:15,580
{\an8}<i>I was visiting the set during Season 3,</i>
<i>sippin' on my sizzurp,</i>

404
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:21,786
<i>and I noticed RuPaul more upset than ever</i>
<i>before, because Merle was saying,</i>

405
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:27,359
<i>"Ru, these earrings would look much better</i>
<i>on someone pretty, like me."</i>

406
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:32,831
-And Ru said something like...
-Stay away from my things.

407
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:38,537
And stay away from my man!
Mother does not play that!

408
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,042
And I was like, "This bitch?"
I had to step in.

409
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,380
-Hey, I brought us all a cake.
-[Kandy] How sweet.

410
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,849
Let me tell the boys.

411
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:57,455
Well, look at this little witch,
trying to steal my job!

412
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,425
-Of course not.
-You can have my job.

413
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:07,132
I'm taking RuPaul's!
Get ready for Merle Ginsberg's Drag Race.

414
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,302
[Michelle] <i>Someone slipped</i>
<i>something into my drink</i>

415
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,238
<i>because I couldn't believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>

416
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,341
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.

417
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:26,051
<i>And the next thing I remember,</i>
<i>Merle was trying to kill Ru!</i>

418
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,424
What in the name of Janice Dickinson
is going on here?

419
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,594
She was trying to kill you
and then take over the show.

420
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,533
Season 3 is coming, and I need a judge.
[gasps] Michelle, could you?

421
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,471
Then I said, reluctantly,
"If Ru needs me, then yes."

422
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,774
<i>"Yes, I will become a judge</i>
<i>on RuPaul's Drag Race."</i>

423
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:54,546
And that's why that devil bitch,
Merle Ginsberg, left the show.

424
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,585
Next up, my story.

425
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,123
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>

426
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:12,430
You know what my name is but, frankly,
this is how it really went down.

427
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:18,003
{\an8}<i>I was oiling up the Pit Crew</i>
<i>when Merle came over to me and said,</i>

428
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,172
<i>"What if the drag queens judge us</i>

429
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,541
<i>instead of us judging them?"</i>

430
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,311
<i>And I said, "Only Judy can judge me."</i>

431
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,949
And then Michelle showed up,
and she had no cake.

432
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:35,520
All she brought me
was some dried up, old, nasty muffins.

433
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,489
And they weren't even gluten-free.

434
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,791
Happy Hanukah, RuPaul. [laughs]

435
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,261
My monkeys made you the potato salad.

436
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:48,600
Yay, I love an emotional time travel movie
with a strong female lead.

437
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,170
You two should talk.

438
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,272
I have to get to the...

439
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,274
Pit Crew.

440
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,418
-A worm stole my credit card once.
-German tourists often wear sandals.

441
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,188
[RuPaul] <i>I wish somebody had slipped</i>
<i>something in my drink, Kennedy,</i>

442
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,192
<i>'cause what ha-happened next</i>
<i>was cray-cray.</i>

443
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,396
And, child, that surveillance camera
caught everything.

444
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,069
<i>Felt like I was in the middle of freaknik</i>
<i>in Miami, Florida.</i>

445
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:37,549
What in the name of Fantasia Barrino
is going on up in here?

446
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,785
Who are we gonna get to judge Season 3?

447
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,120
[crying]

448
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,794
Just grab the crazy one
and put her on the judges' panel.

449
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:54,299
-And then the Pit Crew said...
-"Which one's the crazy one?"

450
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,871
There you have it. That's how
that devil bitch, Michelle Visage,

451
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,608
replaced that devil bitch, Merle Ginsberg.

452
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,543
Hand to God, honey.

453
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,978
[laughter and applause]

454
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,316
[Miss Fame] <i>The video wasn't</i>
<i>as bad as I was expecting it to be.</i>

455
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,917
{\an8}I still don't know what the fuck I said.

456
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,754
{\an8}If you asked me to repeat a line,
I would not know any of them.

457
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,857
Ladies, I've made some decisions.

458
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,963
Ginger Minj, yours is the winning team.

459
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,899
-Yes!
-You are all safe.

460
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,870
But tonight on the runway,
one of you stole the show.

461
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:36,074
Katya, Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.

462
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:41,246
You'll receive
a $2,000 gift card from Fabric Planet.

463
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:45,049
{\an8}Yes! I won a challenge! I am so excited.

464
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,553
Bodily fluid's spraying out
of every orifice.

465
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,123
Katya, Ginger, and Kennedy,
you may leave the stage.

466
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,197
[RuPaul]
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.

467
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,202
-[Ru] First up, Max.
-You as me?

468
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,839
I wasn't seeing it.
It was a little too masculine.

469
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,142
Max, I asked you for one thing.
What was it that I asked you for?

470
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,877
You asked me not to wear any gray hair.

471
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,613
I'm waiting, and I'm becoming impatient.

472
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,451
I couldn't disagree with Michelle more.
Gray hair is your thing and it's not bad.

473
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,855
Nobody's asking her to change,
just try something different.

474
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,524
-That's exactly what changing is.
-[laughs]

475
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,663
I love this look, because it told a story,
and it was scary but beautiful.

476
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,598
-You described Michelle.
-[laughs]

477
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,469
All right, up next, Violet Chachki.
Now, how many inches is your waist?

478
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,138
Either 18 or 19.

479
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,808
You might have been playing a dead person,
but we were living.

480
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,979
You as me, I'm not from Staten Island.
I am from New Jersey.

481
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,448
-What's the difference?
-We say our Rs, darling.

482
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,419
-It's a characterization, Michelle.
-'Cause I always talk like this, Ru!

483
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,823
-Like I'm Jackie Mason.
-All right, next up, Kandy Ho.

484
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,227
I am over the vampire thing.
I feel like it's a cliché now.

485
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:06,965
As Ru, the beard was back.
What was going on with the crazy hairline?

486
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,702
It was so stiff.
I didn't think you captured her at all.

487
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:15,240
All right, next up, Miss Fame.
How's your head?

488
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,110
It hurts.
I can barely hear inside this muff.

489
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,479
It's like a shell.

490
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,782
-She hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Thank you, Michelle.

491
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,153
Yesterday you had a mini breakdown on set.
What was going on?

492
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,057
It was self-sabotage.
My mouth is going and I can't shut up.

493
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,526
-I cannot stop my mouth.
-But I want you...

494
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,362
I want to be present
and get it out of the way.

495
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,697
I'm a sensitive,
heart on my sleeve person,

496
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,301
and I want to be able
to bring that to the panel.

497
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,437
-I want to show you that.
-But you have to learn to listen.

498
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:51,409
Because when I talk to you,
you're a bit ahead of what I'm gonna say.

499
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:56,414
The same with acting. You have to listen
so that you can respond properly.

500
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,651
I don't see what they are talking about.
I think you're fabulous.

501
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,720
-Thank you.
-All right, next up, Pearl.

502
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,757
Someone set their alarm clock
and finally woke up.

503
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,027
I definitely have shaken off
whatever was going on.

504
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,561
Talk about Death Becomes Her.

505
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,465
It feels like the old self died
and the new self has emerged.

506
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,101
And now we're gonna go
to you portraying me.

507
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,137
-What the fuck was that?
-[laughs]

508
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,508
I came alive
when I put that breastplate on.

509
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,644
-[Merle] It seems to work for everyone.
-Except for you.

510
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,148
Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.

511
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,484
I got the convict,
'cause I might have dated a few in my day.

512
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,689
But looking at everybody,
I feel it's just a rung lower than them.

513
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,092
Yesterday was frustrating
because you didn't know the lines.

514
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,562
-Yeah.
-That bummed me out. I think you're good.

515
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,664
[RuPaul]
Thank you. We've heard enough.

516
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,902
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

517
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,672
Now, just between us squirrel friends,

518
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,342
what do you think? Let's start with Max.

519
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:01,446
She came out very goofy,
and I said, "Do you wanna fix that?"

520
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:05,917
And she said,
"No, this is Michelle's version of Merle."

521
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,287
Michelle, I can't believe
you would say Max is predictable.

522
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,589
-You don't know what she'll look like?
-No.

523
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,560
She'll have a white face,
gray hair, and a spot on her face.

524
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,064
As somebody who always wears
their hair the same, I identify with Max.

525
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,700
-Would you do gray hair?
-If it were in a ponytail.

526
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,602
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.

527
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,406
I called her out on the comedy timing,
but that's just not her strong suit.

528
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,176
But to stand up there cinched like that.
That was amazing.

529
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,846
-I know, Ru, you've heard of Mr. Pearl.
-Yes.

530
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,483
The most famous corset maker in the world.
He has like a 16-inch waist.

531
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:42,253
I thought I'll never see a person
who looks like that.

532
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,490
-And tonight, we did.
-I miss us, Merle.

533
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:49,894
-I know, Ru. I do, too.
-So let's move on to Kandy Ho.

534
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,998
I feel like she's flat lined.
It was all wrong.

535
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:59,737
She was beautiful. I loved her movement.
But I don't find her memorable.

536
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,374
Miss Fame. Ross, I know
she had a little bit of a breakdown.

537
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,078
She actually timed out and said,
"Can I have a real moment here?"

538
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:12,517
I don't know. I love an emotional diva.
I just kind of relate to that.

539
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,786
[RuPaul]
Pearl has come a long way.

540
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,588
Her acting in the skit,
I really, really enjoyed it.

541
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:22,393
Have you and Michelle
ever made out in a vat of Jell-O?

542
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,496
-I would remember that.
-Is that what you're saying now in public?

543
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,498
Yeah, roll tape.

544
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,067
[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.

545
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:32,537
When I got to sit with her on the set,
there were these moments of good,

546
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,572
but to get there was so much work.

547
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,208
That might be okay
if you're doing dinner theater,

548
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,645
but on the stage of RuPaul's Drag Race,
it's just not gonna cut it.

549
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,081
All right, silence!

550
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,951
I've made my decision.
Bring back my ghouls.

551
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:51,422
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

552
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,859
Max. You're safe.

553
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,394
Thank you.

554
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,464
Pearl.

555
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,466
You're safe.

556
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,967
[mouths words] Thank you.

557
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,973
Kandy Ho,
you vamped it up on the runway,

558
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,311
but you didn't sink your teeth
into the challenge.

559
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,013
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

560
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,851
Violet Chachki.

561
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,453
You're safe.

562
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,461
Jaidynn Diore Fierce,

563
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,231
this week you failed to break out.

564
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,505
Miss Fame, you got stuck in your head,
and not just by a 12-inch steak knife.

565
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,207
Jaidynn...

566
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,013
My dear, I'm sorry,
but you're up for elimination.

567
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,218

<i>and these are not my dance heels.</i>

569
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,991
Miss Fame, you're safe,
and you may join the other girls.

570
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,363
Two queens stand before me.

571
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:11,169
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip-sync performance

572
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,272
of <i>Break Free</i> by Ariana Grande.

573
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,410
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

574
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:23,414
and save yourself from elimination.

575
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,051
The time has come...

576
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,620

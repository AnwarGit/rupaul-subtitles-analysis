so it‘s just a match
made in heaven.

222
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,266
One thing I would say,

223
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:01,333

Hello, Rucious‘s doctor.

00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,367
Is because I‘m gay?

717
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:26,800
Isn‘t it?

Peace.

Oh...

720
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:40,567
I guess whatever Rucious had,
it really was sickening.

[laughs]

722
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:47,266
Or maybe it was a lil‘
extra somethin-somethin

723
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,400

Wow.

Well, there you have it,
ladies.

737
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,700
And all based on actual events.

739
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,333
Ladies, this week
you acted in teams.

740
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,667
but tonight,
you‘ll be judged individually.

741
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,500
Ladies,
when I call your names,

Ladies, you are safe.

748
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,633
You may leave the stage.

751
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,400
and the low rollers
of the week.

752
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,066
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.

753
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,367
Starting with Thorgy Thor.

754
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,667
Your roller girl look
You‘re giving me ‘70s.

755
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,400
You had the big blonde ‘fro.

756
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,233
-Not the most wildly inventive.
- Okay.

757
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,500
Now I‘m gonna go
to your performance,

758
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,166
which was so good.

759
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,200
Your delivery, your choreography
was meticulously done.

760
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes!
[laughs]

761
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,100
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.

762
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,133
Next up, Derrick Barry.

763
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,033
I like this whole, like,

764
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,233
Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry
kind of thing.

765
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:25,600
You are doing a great job
with trying

766
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,633
to give us something
other than Brittney.

767
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:28,867
But I feel like
you‘re coming out

768
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,500
and these clothes
are wearing you.

769
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,033
With your performance,

770
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:35,433
the personality of the character
didn‘t really connect.

771
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,934
It was too laid back.

772
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:40,100
I‘d love to see you show me
that you do have soul.

773
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,967
So what you need to get to work
on is giving us your soul.

774
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,667
[chuckles]

775
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,266
Thank you very much.

776
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:48,300
Next up, Acid Betty.

777
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,433
Your performance,

778
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,367
I felt like you gave me
the "Sybil" multiple personality

779
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,967
with a little bit
of Carol Burnett goin‘ on.

780
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:58,333
I think you were very
convincing as a schizo.

781
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,233
This look tonight,
it‘s getting kinda predictable.

782
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:04,133
I‘d love to see something
way different.

783
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,166
-Another challenge, Michelle.
-I fucking love challenges.

784
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,467
Be you but don‘t be you.
Give us less but more.

785
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,967

786
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,600
All right, next up,

787
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,500
I love this look.

788
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,467
You did this Glamazon girl
from "Tron."

789
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:21,600
Tin Man, I have to say,
needs some lubricant.

790

[laughs]

791
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,233

to the performance.

Next up,
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

797
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,834
Cynthia.

798
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,166
You have a great body with
a shirt that‘s like a formal

799
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,367
with a formal necklace
and formal earrings,

800
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,533
then you have, like, Hooters
shorts that don‘t fit at all.

801
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,166
It‘s so discombobulated.

802
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,600
The "Empire" scene, I don‘t
know what you were saying,

803
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,567
but I didn‘t care.

804
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:57,266
There were some nuances
that were missed.

805
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,500
What did you think,
watching yourself in the scene?

806
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,367
I love it.

807
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,333
-[laughs]
-It was really good.

808
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,066
It was really good.

809

[laughter]

810
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,567
Thank you very much.

811
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,934
All right, next,
Robbie Turner.

812
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,367
I do love the jumpsuit.

813
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,233
But what‘s bothering me
is all the silver accoutrements

814
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:18,600
and then a gold necklace.

815
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,333
I would lose the necklace.

816
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,300
Um, when we were workin‘
on that scene,

817
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,467
Ru was directing you

818
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,967
to kinda get into
the two different voices.

819
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,600
I don‘t think
you stuck with that.

820
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,900
It was kinda like I
didn‘t have a moment to, like,

821
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,533
break
and think of your notes

822
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,934
before we moved on
to another note

823
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,934
and also remember where
the blocking for the camera was

824
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:39,100
because I can‘t see very far.

825
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,233
When we originally read it,
I was Vanilla Wafer.

826
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,300
And it--we did change it.

827
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,600
Did that hurt you, you think?

828
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,533
I think it did hurt me,
and I didn‘t speak up

829
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,834
even though I was feeling it,

830
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,934
and so for the betterment
of the team, I was like...

831
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,266
You can‘t allow yourself
to be a victim

832
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:55,633
and use the excuse of,
"I was being nice."

833
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,166
It‘s a competition.

834
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,500
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we‘ve heard enough.

835
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,934
While you untuck backstage,

836
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:04,533

Her Chocolate Chip Cookie

842
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:16,300
It‘s safe to say that,
uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie

843
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,567
was baked in a lovin‘ oven.

844
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:18,433
together: Mm-hmm.

845
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,066
It brings all the boys
to the yard.

846
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,433
Yeah!

00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,567

I‘m still waiting
to find Derrick Barry.

852
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,333
I thought the runway
was really cute.

853
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,533
But in the scene,
Ginger Snap got lost to me.

854
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:38,133
I‘ve seen her perform
as Britney Spears.

855
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,133
She puts her whole self into it,

856
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:42,367
and that‘s what she
needed to do in this challenge.

<i>Acid Betty.</i>

858
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,800

<i>but I could probably</i>
<i>do without the Mohawk.</i>

860
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,467
In this role,
she looks like

861
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:52,367
she‘s one french fry short
of a Happy Meal straight away.

It‘s not easy to improv,

864
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,266
but also stay focused
on the scene.

865
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,233
I am feelin‘ her swag.

866
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:04,934
She has charisma and it allows
her to sell absolutely anything.

867
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,266
This Tron jumpsuit
is so basic,

868
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:09,600

"Oh, my God, I love it so much."

869

-Oh! Oh!
-They were Fruit of the Loom.

873
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:22,667

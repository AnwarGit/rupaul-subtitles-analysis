1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,035

          <i> mis amores?</i>

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,039
      Are you ready to see      
        my Coo-Coo again?

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,107
     (laughter and applause)

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:11,208
      I'm back,<i> mis amores.</i>

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,711

      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

6
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:17,580
      - #JusticeForCooCoo.

7
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:22,050
       - Guide me, Jesus.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,727
           - I'm back.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,762
          - Oh, my God.

10
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:36,130
     Welcome back, Cynthia.

11
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:37,431
           - Oh, God.

12
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,865
        - Congratulations       
         to the winner.

13
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:39,765
       - Thank you, doll.       
           Thank you.

14
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,467
   And congrats on you getting  
    better with your health.

15
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,202
   - It was a roller coaster.   
            - Right.

16
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,536
   - But, you know, I'm here.

17
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:48,405
      I was diagnosed with      
     liver cancer stage one,

18
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:52,942
      but I'm in remission      
  and I feel healthier as ever.

19
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:54,810
           My Coo-Coo           
       is fantastic, girl.

20
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:56,945
       I'm not gonna take       
         the opportunity

21
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:59,414
   that RuPaul has given to me  
           in granted.

22
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,449
     This Coo-Coo is ready.

23
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,818
          This is home.

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,586
     - I don't want to sound    
    like a hater or anything,

25
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,055
       but, like, is this,      
          like, a joke

26
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:11,124
           or are you           
     legitimately back, sis?

27
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,259
        - Baby, I'm back.

28
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,693
             I know             
     I'm Miss Congeniality,

29
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,128
      but I'm no came here      
         to play games.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,365
    - I'm happy that Cynthia    
  is getting her second chance,

31
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,300
     but on the other hand,

32
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:26,036
          I'm like, oh,         
        we got this bitch

33
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:30,173
       that already knows       
        this competition,

34
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:33,075
      and that can get you      
         very, very far.

35
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,110
          - I'm afraid          
     of what's coming next.

36
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,778
   This just got real, honey.

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,045
            - Ha-ha!

38
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,915
  - (sighs) I'm not very happy  
      that Cynthia is back.

39
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:42,682
     She could take us out.

40
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:45,351
     - Hallelujah, my pussy     
   and my Coo-Coo is burning.

41
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:48,320
    - I haven't yet seen this   
   infamous Coo-Coo of yours,

42
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,154
      and I need to see it,

43
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:52,624
   because if you're gonna say  
       Coo-Coo around me,

44
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:55,226
   you better make sure yours   
     looks better than mine.

45
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:56,694
             - Ooh.

60
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:34,558
             (alarm)            
             - Ooh!

    already done had herses.

62
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:40,330

            yourself,

63
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,097
             let me.

64
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,365
      I'm your biggest fan.

65
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,399
        Your number one.

66
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:48,770
   Well, technically, only one  
    of you can be number one,

67
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:51,606
       so the rest of you       
       are, like, losers.

68
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,674
         Sorry about it.

69
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,876
           (all laugh)

70
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,946
     - Hello, hello, hello!

71
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:03,416
    (screaming and cheering)

72
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,619
      - Lisa mother fucking     
             Kudrow.

73
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,221
          I am gagged.

74
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,493
   - Lady Gaga was just here,   
      and now Lisa Kudrow.

75
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,194
  I'm really digging Season 9.

76
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:21,231
       - Say hi to my pal       
          Lisa Kudrow.

77
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,233
      (cheers and applause)     
              - Hi.

78
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,969
      - I just ran into her     
           on the lot,

79
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,905
   and she wanted to come over  
         and say hello.

80
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,406
  - Yeah, you guys look great.

81
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,007
       - Oh, my God, stop.

82
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,577
           - (laughs)           
 - Lisa's character Val Cherish

83
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,779
     from the brilliant show    
         "The Comeback,"

84
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,315
          is the reason         
    I say hello, hello, hello

85
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:44,051
           every time           
    I walk into the workroom.

86
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,752
       Did you know that?       
              - No!

87
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:49,088
      - I didn't know that.     
        - Neither did I.

88
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,255
           (all laugh)

89
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:53,858
   - Now, Lisa, would you mind  
      saying that one thing

90
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,061
          that you say          
         for me, please?

91
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,429
        - Well, I got it.

92
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:59,463
           (all laugh)

93
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,399
        - That was good,        
   but can you say it happier?

94
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,033
        - Well, I got it.

95
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,501
        - Bigger, bigger.

96
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:06,802
        - Well, I got it!

97
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,504
           (all laugh)

98
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,072
     Now I look like a fool.

99
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,940
           - (laughs)

100
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,275
    Lisa, come back any time.

101
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,609
         - Okay, thanks.        
      - Thank you, darling.

102
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,445
           Mwah, mwah.          
      (cheers and applause)

103
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,245
             - Bye!

104
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,915
        - Ladies, I have        
  a little secret to tell you.

105
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:29,020
    When I was a little kid,    
  I wanted to be a cheerleader.

106
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,287
           (cheering)

107
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,022
    I loved the short skirts,

108
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:35,725
       the sassy comebacks      
   and the death drop splits.

109
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,960
       So for this week's       
         maxi challenge,

110
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:41,363
       you'll be competing      
     in the biggest, baddest

112
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,433
          #QueerCheers.

113
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,168
           (all laugh)

114
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,204
    First, you need to divide   
        into two squads.

115
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,540
   Nina Bo'nina Brown, you won  
     last week's challenge,

116
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:57,577

          you're back,

117
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,981
      so I'm making you two     
       head cheerleaders.

118
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,416
     Pick your squads. Nina.

119
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,850

120
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,219
           - Ha! Aah!

121
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,020
       - Ooh, you playing       
         the race card?

122
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,321
           (all laugh)

123
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,855
            Cynthia.            
            - Kimora.

124
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:13,355
              - Oh.

125
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:16,024
    - My team is going to be    
        the Coo-Coo team.

126
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,626
            - Alexis.

127
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:19,793
            - Eureka!

128
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,694
         - Oh, come on.

129
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,628
             - Aja.

130
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,162
           (applause)

131
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:24,829
         - Farrah Moan.

132
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:28,566
       - Oh, team Coo-Coo,      
        team Coo-Coo, go!

133
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:30,534
        - I choose Sasha.       
             - Yes!

134
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:31,801
           (applause)

135
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,169
          - Peppermint.

136
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,603
           (applause)

137
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:39,007
  - Because I have a heart for  
 the underdog, I choose Jaymes.

138
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,309
              - Aw.             
              - Aw.

139
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:44,144
      - She was just doing      
       community service.

140
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:44,644
              - Oh!

141
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:47,546
          - I'm feeling         
     a little self conscious

142
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,548
       about being labeled      
          an underdog,

143
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,684
    because I consider myself   
     very much a competitor.

144
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,953
          - All right.          
        Welcome, Trinity.

145
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,855
              Yes!

146
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,225
       - I choose Charlie.

147
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:03,925
           (applause)

148
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:08,095
    - Which means Valentina,    
    you're on Coo-Coo's team.

149
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,630
     - I feel like Valentina    
         was picked last

150
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:11,897
             because            
     she's already mentioned

151
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,099
   she's only been doing drag   
         for 10 months.

152
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:19,003
   So I think we're all like,   
    well, what can she bring?

153
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,972
     - It doesn't feel good     
       to be chosen last,

154
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,640
           but little           
      do these queens know

155
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:28,411
       that in their team       
     they got the superstar.

156
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:29,945
   - Team Nina Bo'nina Brown,

157
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,447
       you'll be cheering       
       for the home team,

158
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,549
       RuPaul's Glamazons.

159
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,417
          - Yes, honey.         
             - Yes.

160
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,051
       - And Team Coo-Coo,      
       you'll be cheering

161
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:43,656
      for our extra special     
    guest judges, the B-52s.

162
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:44,890
             - Yes!             
           (applause)

163
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:47,859
     - Kate, Fred and Cindy     
       gave me a big break

164
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:52,029
when they cast me in their music
     video for "Love Shack."

165
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:54,131
             - Ooh!             
           - Oh, yeah!

166
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,634
     - All right, gentlemen,    
       start your engines.

167
00:06:57,636 --> 00:07:00,837
   And may the best woman win.

168
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,538
          - So anybody          
    have any insight so far?

169
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,540
       - There's literally      
        like an adjective

170
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,174
     for every single queen.    
            - Mm-hmm.

171
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,675
          - So I think          
    we should go through that

172
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,879
  and assess, like, who matches 
    the description the most.

173
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,381
   - Doll, I want to be sassy.

174
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:16,148
             - Okay.

175
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,016
       - Can I be flirty?       
      - You can have that.

176
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,884
       - I think that now       
      would be a great time

177
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,886
         for Jaymes to--        
     if you want to, like--

178
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,154
        - Yes, to really        
          show himself.

179
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:27,824
- If you do snoozy in funny way,
       it would be funny.

180
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,492
        - I think floozy        
         is more my role

181
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,726
      'cause it's all about     
           high energy

182
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,360
          and all about         
       being over the top.

183
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:33,928
      - Impact, yeah, yeah.

184
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,997
        - I want floozy.        
             - Ooh.

185
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,365
      - Take snoozy, girl.

186
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,999
       It'll be hilarious.

187
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,633
         It'll be great.

188
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,234
         I'm not snoozy.

189
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,268
     I'm just--it's not me.

190
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,870
       - Honestly, Alexis,      
           I feel like

191
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:48,671
       even though, like,       
   snoozy may be a challenge,

192
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:51,306
  I think it's a challenge that 
   you can definitely rise to.

193
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:53,241
   - The other girls assure me

194
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,943
      and encourage me that     
     I can make snoozy work.

195
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,445
       You're right, girl.      
     I can do any of these.

196
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,412
   - And these are characters.

197
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,347
    - And you're sure you're    
     comfortable with that?

198
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,414
    - I'll do whatever, yeah.

199
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,816
       And they're right.       
         I'm an actress.

200
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,717
 - Should we, like, stand up and
  do it, just so we have like--

201
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,820
       - Yeah, do you want      
       to get it off the--

202
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,087
           - Ru call.

203
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,922
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.

204
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,224
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.

205
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:17,227
    - Jaymes, I'm Jews--ugh.

206
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,930
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.

207
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,598
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,433
    - I'm Jaymes and I'm--oh.

209
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,435
  I'm Jaymes and I'm a floozy.

210
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:27,235
    - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

211
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:29,403
     I don't think your part    
       comes in that late.

212
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,705
   - You got to jump right in.  
          - Yeah, yeah.

213
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:32,539
     - It's got a slow beat     
             to it.

214
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,840
    - No, but you have to do    
         the first beat.

215
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:37,410
       - You start in time      
and then you stretch the floozy.

216
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,678
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.

217
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,746
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.

218
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:45,583
        - And I'm Jaymes        
        and I'm a floozy.

219
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,818
   - Captain, may I speak out   
    of turn for a little bit?

220
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,652
          - Of course.          
            Go ahead.

221
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,853
             - Girl,            
     you gotta sell floozy.

222
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,021
 If you wanted to be the floozy,
    you gotta be the floozy.

223
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,156
          - All right.          
 - I'm not seeing it yet, okay?

224
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,690
            I'm not--           
    I want to encourage you.

225
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,125
     I'm just saying, do it.    
          Do it, girl.

226
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,159
          Come forward.

227
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:04,063
      - Jaymes doesn't seem     
      to be here mentally,

228
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,330
    and this is not the time

229
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:08,700
    to be figuring out how to   
   get your mind in the game.

230
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,702
   It already has to be there.

231
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,970
   - It's gonna be a long day.

232
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:15,138
         - Coming up...

233
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,439
             - Whoo!            
             - Aah!

234
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,440
          - Oh, my God!

235
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:22,678
      I cannot believe what     
    they are asking us to do.

236
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,914
   - There's gonna be a severe  
     injury on this episode.

237
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,483
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

238
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,485
         (RuPaul laughs)

239
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,752
       - All right, guys.

240
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:34,820
    Five, six, seven, eight.

241
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:35,887
            Let's go!

242
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,723
    - Today's maxi challenge    
        is a straight up

243
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:42,827
       "Bring It On" style      
      cheer battle, bitch.

244
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,295
      - Why don't we do it      
         one more time.

245
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,564
   I'm gonna sing it with you   
    so we can get it in time.

246
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,331
       Let's do it again.

247
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,198
  - This is gonna sound crazy,

248
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
     but what if we go back     
  to your idea you had before?

249
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,234
           - Of what?           
    - Oh, you want to switch?

250
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,603
    - Where I do more of the    
  character and you do flirty.

251
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,837
   - Do you want to try that?   
              Okay.

252
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:57,771
             - Yeah.            
             - Okay.

253
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,239
    - 'Cause that way, if I'm   
  coming right behind somebody,

254
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,340
       it's easier for me       
          to keep time.

255
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,407
    - And that's a good idea.   
              Okay.

256
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,641
         So I'm gonna--         
     we're gonna switch now.

257
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,408
     - We'll switch it out.

258
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,211
  - The decision to have Alexis 
  and Jaymes switch characters

259
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,212
     is the right decision.

260
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,146
     We're all thinking it.

261
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:11,948
      It's gonna be better      
     for everyone concerned.

262
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,883
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.

263
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:16,452
      - Jaymes, I'm floozy.

264
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,455
    - We are actually rooting   
           for Jaymes

265
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:21,389
     and want him to shine,

266
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,158
       but he's gonna have      
      to believe in himself

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,194
         to really sell         
         this challenge.

268
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:31,697
    - One, two, three, four,    
    five, six, seven, eight.

269
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,465
   - It's time for rehearsal.

270
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,966
       - One, two, three.

271
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,702
           (cheering)

272
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,236
         - Ay dios mio!

273
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:43,406
   My Coo-Coo is just shaking   
           right now.

274
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,340
       - All right, guys.       
            I'm Dom.

275
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,041
         I'm a two-time         
  world cheerleading champion,

276
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:50,511
 and I'm here to teach you guys 
  a competitive cheer routine.

277
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:51,245
          - All right.

278
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,546
      - It's gonna consist      
        of some tumbling,

279
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:55,115
   some jumping, some stunts.

280
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,249
           We're gonna          
     have to work together,

281
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,517
   but you're also gonna have   
    to learn how to stand out

282
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,284
        at the same time.

283
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,352
      We're gonna start it      
         with stunting.

284
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:03,954
        - I am so pissed.

285
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,456
      I don't know who even     
    does cartwheels anymore.

286
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,390
   It's not even the eighties.

287
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:11,160
  - So what you're going to do  
       is dip down on one,

288
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,262
            stand up,           
       lock out your legs,

289
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:15,631
   squeeze your tush and hold.

290
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,399
         - Oh, my gosh.

291
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,166
   - Five, six, seven, eight.

292
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:21,369
     One and three, dip one,    
          straight leg.

293
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,737
             - Ooh!             
             - Wow!

294
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:23,704
          - Oh, my God!

295
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:29,876
      I cannot believe what     
    they are asking us to do.

296
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,744
     - Dip one, then three.

297
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:32,745
              - Oh!

298
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:34,046
        - Okay, make sure       
     when you go back down,

299
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,013
            you reach           
      for their shoulders.

300
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:38,750
   - There's gonna be a severe  
     injury on this episode.

301
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:39,851
       - Valentina, ready?

302
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,819
       Dip one, up, three.

303
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,619
   - I was literally shaking,

304
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:47,090
but I said to myself, Valentina,
      when in doubt, smile.

305
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,293
     - One, two, down three.

306
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,762
     Okay. Can we switch out    
         the fliers now?

307
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:56,097
             Ready.             
  And five, six, seven, eight.

308
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,299
     Dip one, straight legs.

309
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:58,866
              - Oh!

310
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,335
             Bitch,             
     I'm scared of heights.

311
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:05,172
           Oh, my God!          
     This is scary as fuck!

312
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:08,074
      If I fall, it's gonna     
        fuck up my face.

313
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:08,874
         - Then, three.         
              - Oh!

314
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,409
            - My face           
     is definitely expensive

315
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,444
        and I don't want        
        to mess that up.

316
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,313
           No, ma'am.           
     Oh, that's not for me.

317
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,650
  - We are feeling the pressure 
          and the burn.

318
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:23,819
        Although the burn       
    might be something else.

319
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:25,187
              - Oh.

320
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,855
          - All right.

321
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:27,455
             - Yes.

322
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:28,422
  - We're back in the workroom

323
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:30,657
    and we're all frantically   
         doing our part

324
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,559
     to get our looks ready     
   for our cheer competition.

325
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,893
        We have our work        
         cut out for us.

326
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,394
      - We all have to look     
            amazing.

327
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,262
    - I don't have bloomers.

328
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:46,669
    - I'm gonna wear tights.

329
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,537
      - Yeah, but you still     
    have to have panties on.

330
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,373
      - No, I'm not wearing     
      anything underneath.

331
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,374
             - What?

332
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,241
    - So if you go like this,

333
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:56,409
       it just looks like       
         Barbie crotch?

334
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,310
    - Why am I being attacked   
        of being a woman?

335
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,880
- Women wear bloomers underneath
   their cheerleading clothes.

336
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,648
     - Not the slutty ones.

337
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,684
           (all laugh)          
    Fine, I'll wear panties.

338
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,251
           - (laughs)

339
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,953
 - RuPaul Glamazons, we're gonna
     teach you how to stunt

340
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,688
   so we can do some pyramids.

341
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,524
      Ready, and five, six,     
          seven, eight.

342
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:15,992
     Dip one, two and three.

343
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:19,295
- Should the inside of the palms
          be together?

344
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:20,362
     - As close as you can.     
             - Okay.

345
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,763
   - Don't think about looking  
        straight forward.

346
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,632
   Turn your head to the side.  
  You're gonna get a face full.

347
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,201
     - That's not a problem.    
           (all laugh)

348
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:28,902
     - You think you got it?

349
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:29,736
            - (sighs)

350
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,939
     I'm thinking to myself,    
   it's probably not the sport

351
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:35,975
           for people           
    with an AARP membership.

352
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:38,444
     - And dip one in three.

353
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,178
      Good. Straight arms.

354
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,679
    Try and lift those knees    
        up to your chest.

355
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,014
  And five, six, seven, eight.

356
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:44,615
      Dip one, two, three.

357
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,383
       How are we feeling?

358
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,251
           - Fabulous.          
           (all laugh)

359
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,620
        We're gonna need        
         stunt doubles.

360
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,791
- You guys, I can't even believe
     I'm still stoning this.

361
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,292
          Like, this is         
        hard labor work.

362
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,395
           This is why          
    I pay people to do this.

363
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,563
      - Stoning really does     
          feed my soul.

364
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,430
       - It does me, too.

365
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,231
      I love to put sparkle     
         on everything.

366
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:06,932
            - I think           
    when you stone anything,

367
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,500
       it's just an excuse      
          to look great

368
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:11,069
         without really         
        even being great.

369
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:13,204
   Stoning is for ugly girls.

370
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:16,473
       Don't get me wrong,      
     but I think all of us,

371
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,941
       we kind of grew up       
     differently, you know.

372
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:20,076
    Like, some of us love to,   
      like, create things.

373
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:21,410
       - Well, some of us       
         don't love it.

374
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,879
   Some of us have to do this   
           to survive.

375
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:26,214
         Sewing all day         
       makes my back hurt,

376
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:28,816
      and I eventually get      
     so creatively exhausted

377
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:32,085
       that I just despise      
  looking at my crafting room.

378
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,586
         But I know that        
     if I don't go in there,

379
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:37,156
 I'm not gonna be able to go to 
the buffet that I want to later.

380
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,357
           (all laugh)

381
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,425
     - Sister, I'll take you    
     to the buffet with me.

382
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:42,059
         - Well, bitch,         
     you take me to a buffet

383
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,126
   and I'll sew you something.

384
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:45,394
    - So can you finish this    
          for me then?

385
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:50,131
      - Kimora is gorgeous,     
      but that attitude...

386
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,832
      - I'm getting tired,      
       I'm getting thirsty

387
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,634
     and I'm getting, like,     
       anxiety right now.

388
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:56,968
        - Not cute, girl.

389
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,302
              - Oh!

390
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,803
         - Coming up...         
             - Wait!

391
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,137
        - Uh, this is my        
      virgin de Guadalupe.

392
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,940
 I've really been praying to her
       every single night.

393
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:08,309
       - You crazy, bitch.

394
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,612
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

395
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,881
         (RuPaul laughs)

396
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,184
             - Yay!             
             - Yeah.

397
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,418
       - Day two, whores.

398
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,122
   - Glamazons are gonna kick   
        the B-52s asses.

399
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,957
      - So today is the day

400
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,124
     we're about to perform

401
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,661
       this mother fucking      
        cheer challenge.

402
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,165
          - Wait! Girl!

403
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,266
         Do you really?

404
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,167
        - Oh, this is my        
      virgin de Guadalupe.

405
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,001
   I wish I could turn her on,

406
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:42,404
but I really been praying to her
       every single night

407
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,471
      just to watch over me

408
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,539
          and guide me          
      through this process.

409
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,640
         - Who, Madonna?

410
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:49,542
              - No,             
     la virgin de Guadalupe.

411
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:52,777
       - You crazy, bitch.

412
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,545
     That's some crazy shit.

413
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,280
           - Everybody          
    gets to have a drag mom,

414
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,915
         but I feel like        
     la virgin de Guadalupe

415
00:15:58,917 --> 00:15:59,782
         is my drag mom.

416
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,183
     She helped get me here.

417
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,285
           She's gonna          
        help me win, too.

418
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,320
      (praying in Spanish)

419
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,288
       Please help me win       
         this challenge.

420
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,522
         I need to win.

421
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:10,156
      Love you, thank you.

422
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:11,757
          - Did you do          
       high school sports?

423
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,528
   - I played tennis and then   
   I did swimming and diving.

424
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,962
     And I think the diving

425
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,563
      kind of helped me out     
     with this a little bit.

426
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:22,499
       - Yeah. Girl, I did      
    high school cheerleading.

427
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,533
             - Yes.             
       - We never did no--

428
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:25,301
          Girl, it was          
      a black high school.

429
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:26,869
      We, like, you know...

430
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,671
        - Right. (laughs)

431
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,409
       - I'll never forget      
        I was in the gym

432
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,510
   with all the cheerleaders.

433
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,512
  Some of the girls were like,  
      oh, what do you think

434
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,747
  about that basketball player  
           over there?

435
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,417
         He was so fine.

436
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,184
            - Boing.

437
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,320
        - Like, gorgeous        
           cocoa skin.

438
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:50,255
         And I was like,        
    oh, he's cute, he's cute.

439
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:51,856
     And later on, at lunch,

440
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:54,658
I see the entire basketball team
          looking at me

441
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,326
    like I'm about to get it.

442
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,562
    So I get up and I'm like,   
  let me get out of here early.

443
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,529
          I'm by myself         
        in the stairwell,

444
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:06,568
 and the entire basketball team 
       comes up the steps,

445
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,603
       and one of the boys      
    beats the hell out of me.

446
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:10,972
            - (gasps)           
           - No, Pep.

447
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:12,306
          - It's true.

448
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:16,009
      But afterwards, I was     
    talking to the secretary,

449
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:16,876
     told her what happened.

450
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,277
        And you know how        
     the high school offices

451
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,012
           have, like,          
       all glass windows.

452
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:20,579
            - Uh-huh.

453
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,881
      - So I turned around,     
          and I swear,

454
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:26,184
        the entire school       
         was just there.

455
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:27,919
          It felt like          
        a circle of love.

456
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,755
    Like, people were crying,   
   my friends were out there.

457
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,757
     So I felt pretty good,     
            you know.

458
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,024
      And he got expelled.      
           - Right on.

459
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:36,493
       - I stayed captain       
   of the cheerleading squad.

460
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,260
           - Come on.

461
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,761
  - When I was in high school,

462
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:41,997
        I was singled out       
      for being different.

463
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:42,998
      After that incident,

464
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,433
         I had strangers        
       reaching out to me,

465
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,668
      and I knew right away

466
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,272
        that I was loved,       
      and that felt great.

467
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,941
      - Cynthia, your story     
        really touched me

468
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:59,477
      because I have a lot      
     of people in my family

469
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,446
      who have had cancer,      
    and, like, and who have--

470
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,914
         who have passed        
        because of that.

471
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,548
          - Oh, my God.         
  - I just wanted to make sure

472
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,216
    that you're okay, because   
      I know your struggle

473
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,552
  which was hard, and it really 
        touched my heart.

474
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:13,054
          - Thank you.          
           Girl, whoo!

475
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:13,988
        It's a challenge.

476
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,357
   Everything was a real mess.

477
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,594
     I get my results and it    
   was liver cancer stage one.

478
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,796
      So I was like, what?

479
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,065
   You know, I mean, I just...

480
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,367
     I was living my dream,

481
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:32,904
     and now I need to face,    
       like, liver cancer.

482
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,641
           I was sad.

483
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,342
        I was really sad.

484
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:42,345
     It's hard when you know    
     that you have a disease

485
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,613
       and maybe probably       
       could be, you know,

486
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:45,914
   the last days of your life.

487
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,683
             I mean,            
  the immune system goes down.

488
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:49,450
         So even a cold,

489
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:51,985
     it can possibly, like,     
     kill you, so, I mean--

490
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:57,423
     - It's unreal to think     
       that you could die.

491
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:58,991
        - At any moment.        
          - Any moment.

492
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:01,326
     - But let me tell you.     
        I'm in remission.

493
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:07,498
    - Cynthia is living proof   
   that cancer is not the end.

494
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,866
       - Whoo! Group hug.       
      We need a group hug.

495
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:12,336
         - If anything,         
  she's stronger competing now.

496
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:15,872
    It has given her a drive    
       to really succeed,

497
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:19,108
       and she's doing it       
           with beauty

498
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,676
   and with a sense of humor,

499
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:22,544
   and that's a drag we need.

500

00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:56,707
   - Welcome to the main stage

507

510
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:03,612
           - (laughs)

511
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:08,249
And everybody's grooving because
         it's the B-52s.

512
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,585
      Hey, is your tin roof     
          still rusted?

513
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,153
          - Ooh, yeah.          
           - Oh, yeah.

514
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:14,854
          - Yeah, baby.

515
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:16,422
          - This week,          
    our queens are competing

516
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,892
     in the biggest, baddest    
       cheer battle ever.

517
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:23,829
       Let's check in with      
   our very own Ross Mathews.

518
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,997
           - Yes, Ru,           
      this is so exciting!

519
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,299
         It smells like         
          queen spirit.

520
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:31,101
          I'm actually          
       literally gagging.

521
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,602
          Back to you.

522
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:35,037
         - Thanks, Ross.        
       We'll be watching.

523
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,406
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines,

524
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:40,308
   and may the best woman win.

525
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,876
          Coming up...

526
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,846
             - Whoo!            
              - Ow!

527
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,747
          (bell dings)

528
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,449
         (RuPaul laughs)

529
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,851
      - It's the "RuPaul's      
           Drag Race"

530
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,353
   Cheer Battle Extravaganza!

531
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:01,024
       RuPaul's Glamazons       
    versus the B-52 Bombers.

532
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,593
           - Ru call.

533
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,261
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.

534
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,096
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.

535
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,864
     - I'm Shea, I'm flirty.

536
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,498
     - I'm Sasha, I'm dirty.

537
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,166
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.

538
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:13,901
    - I'm Jaymes, I'm snoozy.

539
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,803
          - I'm Alexis          
        and I'm a floozy.

540
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,805
      All: We are RuPaul's      
           Glamazons.

541
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,973
   Got our tucking panties on.

542
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,674
    Our beat is unstoppable.

543
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:23,975
    Our wigs are unclockable.

544
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:27,812
    All: All right, work it,    
       work it, all right.

545
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,815
    - B-52 Bombers, let's go!

546
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,683
   - I'm Coo-Coo, I'm naughty.

547
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,518
    - I'm Kimora, I'm slutty.

548
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,319
    - I'm Eureka, I'm wacky.

549
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,820
    - I'm Trinity, I'm tacky.

550
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:39,388
    - I'm Farrah, I'm thorny.

551
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,189
        - I'm Peppermint,       
           I'm corny.

552
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:44,225
        - I'm Valentina,        
         I'm also corny.

553
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:45,726
           (all laugh)

554
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,594
        All: Our lobsters       
          are rocking.

555
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:49,028
    Our love is in the shack.

556
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,863
          We're roaming         
        'cause we wanna,

557
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,631
      so haters step back.

558
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,265
         ALL: B-50-who?

559
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,332
       Not as cool as Ru.

560
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:58,134
      RuPaul is more fierce     
    than Kate could ever be.

561
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:01,437
      More woman than Fred      
    and more man than Cindy.

562
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:04,339
    All: RuPaul is shameless,   
  selling candy bars and more.

563
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,407
             - Ugh!             
   All: She even had a perfume

564
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,375
    and it was called Whore.

565
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:11,077
           (all laugh)

566
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,312
   All: Your beehive's busted.

567
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,513
    Your songs are too slow.

568
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:20,919
      You should go retire      
      in a private Ida-ho.

569
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:23,888
         - And it's time        
    for the tumbling package.

570
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,356
         (whistle blows)

571
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,602
        - Yeah, big girl.       
      Come on, bitch, yes.

572
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,471
           Holy fuck.

573
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:44,073
             I land             
     and I feel my knee pop.

574
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:47,176
   But I knew there was no way  
         I was stopping.

575
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:48,443
      Bitch, I'm on a roll.

576
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,777
             - Whoo!            
             - Aah!

577
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,545
   - Now, that was impressive.

578
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:55,014
    - Valentina surprised me.

579
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,949
    I feel a little bit like,   
           oh, my God.

580
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:00,018
       I choose her last,

581
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,520
      but she came to slay.

582
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,194
       - Ms. Jaymes? Girl.

583
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:18,234
             - Whoo!            
             - Whoo!

584
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,671
         - There we go.

585
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:25,940
          (horn blows)

586
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:29,143
  - Now the ladies will move on 
       to the group dance.

587
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,858
             - Whoo!

588
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,765
              Whoo!

589
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,733
      (cheers and applause)

590
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,067
   - Five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,570
      - Glamazons, Bombers,     
      the battle raging on.

592
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,438
     This cheer ain't over.

593
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,308
        Now bring it on!

594
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,612
    - When I get all the way    
         up to the top,

595
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,581
        I feel like, yes,       
       I'm a cheerleader.

596
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,982
              - Oh!

597
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,755
             - Whoo!            
      (cheers and applause)

598
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:23,657
 - The judges are going to have 
 a tough time scoring this one.

599
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:24,958
      I feel bad for them.

600
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,759
            Oh, wait.           
        I'm a judge. Uh.

601
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:31,430
        - The category is       
      white party realness.

602
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,598
       Nina Bo'nina Brown       
           Zeta Jones.

603
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,933
    - Glamazon Shazaam-a-zon.

604
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,536
   - When Nina Bo'nina Banana   
      Osama bin Laden Brown

605
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:42,539
     hits the runway, child,    
        I'm a bad bitch.

606
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,873
   - Hungry, hungry hip pads.

607
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,974
             - Ooh.

608
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,242
       - Alexis Michelle.

609
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:49,944
       - Do these earrings      
      make my ass look fat?

610
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,811
     - I'm serving glamour,

611
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:54,080
    but I've got it turned on   
   its ear just a little bit.

612
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:55,314
       - Tin roof frosted.

613
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:57,783
           (all laugh)

614
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:59,351
          Shea Coulee.

615
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:01,052
         - I'll have two        
     vanilla cones, please.

616
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:06,590
   - I'm serving you chocolate  
     sixties bodacious babe.

617
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,059
         - Remember when        
   we used to do white lines?

618
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,461
             - Whoo!            
           - (laughs)

619
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:13,129
        - Charlie Hides.

620
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:15,965
       - Very Linda Evans       
         from "Dynasty."

621
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:16,665
    - The outfit is amazing.

622
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,968
      I look like a fashion     
 illustration of the Snow Queen.

623
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,937
           - You know,          
      she's from the hood.

624
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,004
         - Sasha Velour.

625
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:27,207
     - I've taken a classic     
    silhouette and updated it

626
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:30,977
  with a commitment to showing  
      women who are strong.

627
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,546
 - You know what they say about 
   girls who wear white pumps.

628
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:34,647
         - True hooker.

629
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,982
            - Mm-hmm.

630
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:37,816
             - Aja.

631
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,751
     - Where's my fava beans    
          and chianti?

632
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:43,588
       - I believe that's       
  a whitening strip, actually.

633
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,089
       - I'm an Illuminati      
            princess.

634
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:47,724
    They tried to silence me,   
    and I'm like, no, bitch,

635
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:48,491
      I'm still gonna talk.

636
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:51,193
     - Now you Khali-see me,    
         now you don't.

637
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:52,127
             - Hmm.

638
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,129
       - Jaymes Mansfield.

639
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:56,197
       - Gentlemen prefer       
          a white muff.

640
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:58,933
        - My look is fun.       
           It's campy.

641
00:25:58,935 --> 00:26:01,101
        I look fabulous.

642
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,002
    - The girl can't help it.

643
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:06,438
     - Oh, I'm sure she can.

644
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,106
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

645
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,942
   - Oh, my goodness, I think   
      I'm having a déjà Ru.

646
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,643
         - I'm going to         
       the most expensive

647
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:15,979
     white party ever, okay?

648
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,147
       - My fair Coo-Coo.

649
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,414
           - (laughs)

650
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,982
         - Farrah Moan.

651
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:22,149
    - I like the peek-a-boos.

652
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:23,817
        - I'm giving you        
      a little bit of ass,

653
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,687
      a little bit of class     
     and some broken glass.

654
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,755
   - She is quite the hipster.

655
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,957
           Valentina.

656
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,458
              - Oh.

657
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,625
           - Nice day           
      for a white wedding.

658
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:38,028
    - I'm inspired by my mom    
    and dad's wedding video.

659
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,498
     My mom was known as the    
beautiful bride in her hometown,

660
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,166
           and I want           
     to tell you that story.

661
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,068
- If anybody has any objections,
        shut the fuck up.

662
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,936
        - Yeah. (laughs)

663
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,804
         Trinity Taylor.

664
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,139
     - I think a UFO landed.

665
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,474
   - My ass looks really good   
      in these white pants.

666
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,610
  They look like two snowballs  
         just juggling.

667
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,478
  - I hear she comes in piece.

668
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,214
           (all laugh)

669
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,448
         - Kimora Blac.

670
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,683
          - Now that's          
     my kind of patriotism.

671
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:07,117
  - I'm going to a white party  
            on a boat

672
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,420
        with hot sailors,       
    and we're gonna have fun.

673
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,422
  - I don't think she'll sink,  
             do you?

674
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:16,025
        - She comes with        
    her own flotation device.

675
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:19,628
           Peppermint.          
        Ooh, winter mint.

676
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,530
          - I've chosen         
    an Elvis Presley-inspired

677
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,899
   rock 'n' roll extravaganza.

678
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:29,103
      - That pearl necklace     
      seems to be dripping.

679
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,204
            - Eureka.

680
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:33,040
    Honey, it's milking time.   
            - Uh-huh.

681
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,008
    - I'm giving you glamour,

682
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,544
    androgynous Glamazonian,    
         big tuna fish.

683
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:40,712
            - Eureka,           
    like the vacuum cleaner?

684
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:42,413
    - Yes, and she can suck.

685
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:46,150
 - Maybe I won't have my mother 
        watch this show.

686
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:48,452
           (all laugh)

687
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:49,286
         - Coming up...

688
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:51,321
   - You were so fun to watch.

689
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,890
      - Space age fashion,      
           I adore it.

690
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,491
  - You're like a drug dealer.  
     Gave me a little dose.

691
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:57,326
         I wanted more.         
           (all laugh)

692
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:59,861
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

693
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,263
         (RuPaul laughs)

694
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,864
       - Welcome, ladies.

695
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:06,765
            This week           
     you competed as teams,

696
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:10,201
      but you'll be judged      
         as individuals.

697
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:14,638
     When I call your name,     
      please step forward.

698
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,573
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.

699
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,841
        Alexis Michelle.

700
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:21,844
          Sasha Velour.

701
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:22,811
              Aja.

702
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,580
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

703
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,582
          Farrah Moan.

704
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,850
           Peppermint.

705
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:32,018
             Eureka.

706
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,819
      Ladies, you are safe.

707
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:35,287
           - (exhales)

708
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,054
          - Thank you.

709
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:38,256
   - You may leave the stage.

710
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:45,162
            It's time           
  for the judges' critiques...

711
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:47,463
   Starting with Shea Coulee.

712
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:51,266
  - Tonight, you are giving me  
      this futuristic look

713
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:54,135
  with hair that hearkens back  
         to Barbarella,

714
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,369
   and I'm really feeling it.

715
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:57,804
   - And the routine you did,   
       you were fantastic.

716
00:28:57,806 --> 00:29:00,740
  - She did some amazing flips, 
    and I made note of that.

717
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:02,374
         - You could see        
      the humor there, too.

718
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:05,410
   - As a kid, I wanted to be   
  like Dominique Dawes so bad,

719
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,480
  but my parents were like, uh, 
you can do that in the backyard.

720
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,081
      We ain't putting you      
         in no lessons.

721
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,950
           (all laugh)          
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.

722
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,319
     Next up, Charlie Hides.

723
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,655
     - I didn't remember you    
    from the acrobatic thing.

724
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,792
   - I tried to star everyone   
that I really thought stood out.

725
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,493
   - Did Charlie have a star?   
              - No.

726
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:28,963
    - But I'll tell you this,   
  you seized me on the runway.

727
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:32,032
   This look is just so good.

728
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,066
          - Thank you.

729
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:36,469
           - Up next,           
        Jaymes Mansfield.

730
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:37,203
              - Hi.

731
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:40,105
        - The way you pad       
          is glorious.

732
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:43,141
     You're giving me, like,    
       saddlebag and hips.

733
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:44,208
            It's hot.           
        But in the cheer,

734
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,245
      I don't remember you,     
      and that's not good.

735
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:53,283
  I think you like to consider  
    yourself a comedy queen,

736
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:56,819
  but I haven't found anything  
     funny coming from you.

737
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,388
           I feel that          
   you're unsure of yourself.

738
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,190
     You have to believe it     
      in order to sell us.

739
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,157
            - You do            
      this airhead shtick,

740
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,659
  and I think if you committed  
   all the say, it'd be great.

741
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,694
     And I think that's what    
     Michelle's getting at,

742
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,696
        is the confidence       
         to commit 100%,

743
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:13,632
         and I feel like        
          it's at 20%.

744
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:16,968
      - Next up, Valentina.

745
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,971
         - I loved this         
      virginal Latina bride

746
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:23,007
      down to the crossing      
          of yourself.

747
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:23,941
      It was also beautiful

748
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:28,111
  all the way down to the nude  
       and not white shoe.

749
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,512
   But we won't bring that up.

750
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:30,312
           (all laugh)

751
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:33,581
     Now, the cheerleading,     
      what I loved the most

752
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,382
       was that even when       
     the lights weren't on,

753
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,984
   I was watching you, and you  
    were fully in character.

754
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:41,220
     And it just--it was so,    
       like, "SNL" moment.

755
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:42,754
        - I found myself        
        looking for you.

756
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,322
   You're like a drug dealer.   
   You gave me a little dose.

757
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:45,656
         I wanted more.         
           (all laugh)

758
00:30:45,658 --> 00:30:47,758
    Keep it up, or as you say   
          in Spanish--

759
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,861
     I don't know how you--     
  I don't know how to say that.

760
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:51,928
           (all laugh)

761
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,930
   - Next up, Trinity Taylor.

762
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,564
            - You had           
     the toughest job of all

763
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:59,935
     as the ultimate flier,     
  and you were so fun to watch.

764
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:02,337
          - And I think         
    this outfit's fantastic.

765
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,339
         Beyond Mugler.         
          - Thank you.

766
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:06,841
     - Up next, Kimora Blac.

767
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:10,311
     - What stood out to me     
     was the wig you had on,

768
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:13,614
 but you didn't really stand out
          athletically.

769
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:14,314
     - And that's not good.

770
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:18,217
  - Tonight, probably my least  
     favorite on the runway.

771
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:18,884
       If I looked at you,

772
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,318
     I'd automatically think    
         nautical theme.

773
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,586
  I wish the gloves were white  
     and the bra was white.

774
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,120
      I know it sounds like     
      it's a lot of white,

775
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:27,256
     but it's a white party.

776
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:30,092
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   I think we've heard enough.

777
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:33,562
   While you untuck backstage,

778
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:35,463
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

779
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:40,000
     All right, just between    
      us squirrel friends,

780
00:31:40,002 --> 00:31:40,934
       what do you think,

781
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:43,002
   starting with Shea Coulee?

782
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:47,539
  - I thought she was the best  
   in the athletic department,

783
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,807
          and I thought         
    she looked great tonight.

784
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:50,974
       I love that outfit.

785
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,042
   - In terms of star quality,  
           she has it.

786
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,812
      But I think she needs     
  to have some kind of padding.

787
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:58,648
        She's got thighs,       
   but she ain't got no booty.

788
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,784
   - All right. Let's move on   
        to Charlie Hides.

789
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,085
  - In the cheerleading thing,

790
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,719
  she had this great character  
            of Boozy.

791
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:08,956
 You, out of everybody, Charlie,
 could've taken it all the way.

792
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,991
          - But Charlie         
        looked beautiful,

793
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:12,892
 certainly carried herself well 
         on the runway.

794
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:16,362
   - I'm eager to see what she  
 pulls out of her suitcase next,

795
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:18,430
       but she better pull      
      personality out, too.

796
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,331
       - Jaymes Mansfield.

797
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,300
    - Listen, you got a name    
     like Jaymes Mansfield,

798
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:24,634
       you better deliver.

799
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:26,502
        - I used to watch       
        "The Match Game,"

800
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:30,239
    and Jayne Mansfield would   
     come on every so often

801
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,007
        and had a wiggle        
          in her walk.

802
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:34,376
     Jaymes needs more voom     
         in his vah-vah.

803
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:38,713
 - She wants to portray herself 
   as this comedic character,

804
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:39,513
       when I don't think

805
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,815
        that character's        
    completely realized yet.

806
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:46,319
     - Jaymes' audition tape    
     was so funny, I got it.

807
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:48,120
    I understood the shtick.

808
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:50,722
  But I think that since she's  
    been in this competition

809
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,757
      with the other girls,     
        she's thrown off.

810
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,758
             - Yeah.

811
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,825
          - Valentina.

812
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,160
      - Valentina, rrrrrrr.

813
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:57,793
           (all laugh)

814
00:32:57,795 --> 00:33:00,395
        As a cheerleader,       
      she really stood out

815
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:01,896
  with her facial expressions.

816
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:02,963
        She just made you       
           notice her.

817
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:06,433
     - And I thought she was    
    the best dressed tonight.

818
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:07,367
   I thought she was stunning.

819
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,769
  - Michelle, you did clock her 
       on her nude shoes.

820
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,971
          - I'm sorry,          
  I just couldn't let that go,

821
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,573
         because she was        
    so flawless head to toe,

822
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,741
      why wouldn't she put      
        a white shoe on?

823
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:17,808
       Why would she throw      
         a nude clunker?

824
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,477
 - Well, maybe she was thinking 
  something old, something new,

825
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:23,546
       something borrowed,      
         something nude.

826
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:25,047
           (all laugh)

827
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,615
       - Someone you blew.

828
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:28,583
           (all laugh)

829
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,117
        - Trinity Taylor.

830
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,585
           - I thought          
    it was really impressive

831
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:33,920
       how both characters      
   were completely different.

832
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,087
           I wouldn't           
      have recognized her.

833
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:36,922
- Tonight on the runway, though,
   it wasn't my favorite thing

834
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:39,891
    'cause we've kind of seen   
  a lot of this over the years.

835
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,092
           - I thought          
      it was very original.

836
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:45,629
      - Space age fashion,      
   I mean, that's total B-52.

837
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:46,830
           I adore it.

838
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:47,964
         - Kimora Blac.

839
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:50,666
     - I didn't remember her    
      from the competition,

840
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:53,702
         and that wasn't        
       my favorite outfit.

841
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,703
           - I thought          
        she was a newbie.

842
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:55,804
      - I know why you got      
        that impression,

843
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:58,907
       because she paired       
     so many different looks

844
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,675
       onto that one look.      
            - Right.

845
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:04,845
     - Where someone who's a    
seasoned prostitute would have--

846
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:07,848
     would have just chosen     
        the nautical hat.

847
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,986
    It actually accented her    
   inability to tell a story.

848
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:14,153
       - She's got so much      
         going for her,

849
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:17,723
  the look, the face, the body, 
    the confidence on stage.

850
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,026
   But in terms of who are you  
         as a performer,

851
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:23,228
          I don't know,         
   but I know I want to know.

852
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,630
      - All right. Silence!

853
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:28,566
     I've made my decision.

854
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,502
      Bring back my girls.

855
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,071
   (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)

856
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,306
         (RuPaul laughs)

857
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,640
     - Welcome back, ladies.

858
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:41,676
    I've made some decisions.

859
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,146
          Shea Coulee.

860
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:47,447
          You're safe.

861
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,915
          - Thank you.

862
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,550
       - Jaymes Mansfield.

863
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:55,554
   On the runway, you gave us   
        bombshell floozy,

864
00:34:55,556 --> 00:35:00,191
     but your cheer routine     
    was a little too snoozy.

865
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:04,094
     I'm sorry, my dear, but    
   you're up for elimination.

866
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:05,895
       - It's frustrating.

867
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:10,199
     What I'm trying to show    
  the judges isn't translating,

868
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:13,735
     and I don't really know    
  what else they want from me.

869
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,737
        - Trinity Taylor.

870
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,372
          You're safe.

871
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:20,073
          - Thank you.

872
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:22,775
          - Valentina.

873
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,443
     Your cheer engaged us,

874
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:29,147
     and your bridal runway     
      made me say, "I do."

875
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:30,915
         Sissy-boom-bah,

876
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:33,150
        you're the winner       
    of this week's challenge.

877
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:38,788
You've won a custom wig wardrobe
      from Rock Star Wigs.

878
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,089
      - Thank you so much.

879
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:41,890
         - You may join         
        the other girls.

880
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,293
         Charlie Hides.         
    You scored on the runway,

881
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:50,031
     but your cheer routine     
  did not meet our squad goals.

882
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:54,268
   Kimora Blac, in the cheer,   
        you disappeared.

883
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:59,072
   And in white, you got read   
       for being too blue.

884
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,973
        Charlie Hides...

885
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,242
          You're safe.

886
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,911
     - Thank you very much.

887
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,416
    - Kimora Blac, I'm sorry,   
            my dear,

888
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:16,585
         but you are up         
        for elimination.

889
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:20,989
   Two queens stand before me.

890
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:21,956
        Prior to tonight,

891
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:26,093
    you were asked to prepare   
     a lip sync performance

892
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:29,930
         of "Love Shack"        
          by the B-52s.

893
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:34,100
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me

894
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:38,804
        and save yourself       
        from elimination.

895
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,273
      The time has come...      
            (thunder)

896
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:46,844
     To lip sync for your...

897
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,680
          (echo) life!

898

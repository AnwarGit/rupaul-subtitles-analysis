00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:08,433
- Big girls are gonna represent
this year.

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,867
Fuck them skinny bitches.

4
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:12,667
- Pandora, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:13,967
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,367
I'm in a group with, like,
Satan's baby.

7
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,867
I could be a bigger bitch.

8
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:19,100
- I need money!

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,533
My biggest fears in
the competition is my English.

10
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,800
Please help me.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,600
- Raven, during the solo,
you didn't make a lot of money.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,567
- Fuck.

13
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:30,533
I fucked this up.

14
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,400
- You're up for elimination.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Nicole Paige Brooks,
sashay away.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,033
- Thank you.
Thank you.

-<i> And it don't taste like</i>
<i>chicken.</i>

22
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,934
- Did you just put shortening
in your crotch?

23
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,967

[alarm beeps]

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,233
- Oh, God.
- Oh, wow.

40
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,066
- Not a picnic.
- Oh...

41
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,233
- We're eating something.

42
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,433
- Do we have to eat?

43
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,200
- Oh, Lord.

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,100
- As we walked into
the work space,

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,533
all I saw was one long table
with ten chairs.

46
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,200
Something is going in my mouth.
I know that much.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
- Just hope it ain't
no cherry pie.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,533
- Nicole says, "Be safe, bitch."

49
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,800
- There's more room over here
now.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,967
Coming back into the work room
after Nicole had left

51
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,266
and I had to lip synch
for my life, it felt good

52
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,100
that I had beat her.

53
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,433
Being in the bottom two, bitch?

54
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,467
No.

55
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,867
- I bet that's nerve-racking.

56
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,633
- I did not come here
to lip synch for my life.

57
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,367
I came here to win.

58
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,066
- We love you, Nicole.

59
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,633
- But you got to go.

Well, howdy, y'all.

[cheers and applause]

74
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, my, my, my.

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,500
Go on, now.
Sit a spell, y'all.

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,834
Now, Georgia is where my career
really took off.

77
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,300
I am a country queen at heart.

78
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,066
In those early years,
I had no money.

79
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,500
I would eat anything.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,900
And now that's what
you're gonna do.

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,133
[groaning]

82
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,266
- Mystique's gonna finally win
a challenge.

83
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,367
Finally.

84
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:37,533
- Your mini-challenge
is a taste test

85
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,500
to figure out if what
you're eating is chicken...

86
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,867
or what.

87
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,500
What?!
Or chicken.

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Chicken or what?!

89
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,066
The first two queens
to get three points

90
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,533
will be the winners.

91
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,867
Oh, and please put on your
blindfolds.

92
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,233
- Oh.

93
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,734
- No, sir.

94
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:03,533
- I did not know that this was
gonna be drag<i> Survivor.</i>

95
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,233
- Here is y'all's first course.

96
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,200
Ready?

97
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,166
Let's eat.

98
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,867
- Mm.

99
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,700
Answers please.

100
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,233
The correct answer is "what?!"

101
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,934
They were bull testicles.

102
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:24,667
- Are you fucking kidding me?

103
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,600
- Nothing says country cuisine

104
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,233
like bull testicles.

105
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,300
Okay, ladies.

106
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,633
Second course.

107
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,700
Dig in.

108
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,734
It's finger-licking good.

109
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:34,767
All right.

110
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,066
Answers please.

111
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,900
The correct answer is "what?!"

112
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,700
Mystique has two right.

113
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,433
Morgan has two.

114
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,400
And Pandora has two.

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,934
What you just put in your mouth
was soy chicken.

116
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,066
- Oh, okay.
- Isn't so bad.

117
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,100
Third course.

118
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,133
Dig in.

119
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,166
[ominous music]

120
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,600
- Ew.

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,667
- I'm thinking that it's, like,
a rat tail or something.

122
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,100
I knew that wasn't chicken,
honey.

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,066
- Chicken or what?!

124
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,800
The correct answer is "what?!"

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Now, what you just put
in your mouth...

126
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,166
were frog legs.

127
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,667
- Oh!

128
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,166
- Ladies, we have a three-way

129
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,800
tie between Mystique...

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
- Hell yeah.

131
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,934
- Pandora, and Morgan.

132
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,700
In front of you is a basket of

133
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,066
chicken, rabbit, alligator,
and deep-fried cow brains.

134
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,500
Mm-mm.

135
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,600
The first two queens to finish
everything in their baskets

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,133
and show me their empty mouths
will be the winners.

137
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,567
Are you ready?

138
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,333
Dig in.

139
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,100
Melts in your mouth.
Not in your hands.

140
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,734
- I had a plan.

141
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:47,233
Chew halfway, fill your mouth
with water, swallow.

142
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,166
- Fuck these skinny bitches.

143
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,133
Yummy.

144
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,533
You have to eat everything.

145
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,867
- Hell yeah.
- All right.

146
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,667
Empty mou--all right, she ate
everything.

147
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,333
Mystique is--we have a winner
over here.

148
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,333
- Mystique might as well have
picked up the basket,

149
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,133
opened the hatch,
and just dropped it down.

150
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,500
She was done like that.

151
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,133
- It's down to Pandora
and Morgan McMichaels.

152
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,834
Morgan has two morsels left.

153
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,367
- Swallow, Morgan.

154
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,467
Swallow.

155
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,867
- I took one swallow of
cow brains, and I just ralphed.

156
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,066
- Aah!

157
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,100
- You're still in the game.

158
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,433
You're still in the game.

159
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,333
- Come on, Pandora.

160
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,433
You got it, girl.
You got it.

161
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,967
- We got a second winner
over here.

162
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,800
Morgan McMichaels.

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,900
- [belches]

164
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,200
- Congratulations,
Mystique and Morgan.

165
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,133
You're winners, baby,

166
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,333
and the captains for your next
group challenge.

167
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,367
- Congratulations.

168
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,367
- For today's main challenge,

169
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,467
you'll be shooting a commercial

170
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:53,367
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.

171
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,066
That's Disco--Extra-Greasy.

172
00:06:56,066 --> 00:07:01,066
And you're gonna be selling it
country-queen style.

173
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,834
Okay, Mystique.

174
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:03,834
Who do you choose?

175
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,133
- Pandora.

176
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,400
- Pandora, come on down.

177
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,333
- Raven.

178
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,767
- West coast.
- West coast.

179
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,934
- Juju.
- Laotian in the house.

180
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,133
- Sahara.

181
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,333
- I was picking strategically.

182
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,567
Other people was probably not.

183
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,533
They was picking friends.

184
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,533
Tatianna.
- Tatianna.

185
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,800
- Sonique.

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,066
- So Jessica and Tyra remain.

187
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,166
- Mystique kind of looked at me
like, "Who?"

188
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,066
And I was like,
"Fuck no to Tyra."

189
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,867
- The spicy Latina.

190
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,066
- Jessica.

191
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,533
- It didn't bother me at all.

192
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,233
They saved the best for last.

193
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,600
- Here are two scripts for your
commercials.

194
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,467
One for fried chicken

195
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:46,066
and one for fried fish fillets.

196
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,800
Mystique, you get to pick one.

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,500
- I'll get the closest one...
- All right.

198
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,200
Both commercials have the same

199
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,066
country queen characters.

200
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:58,166
Your commercials will debut
tomorrow on the main stage.

201
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,367
Gentlemen, start your engines,

202
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:04,567
and may the best woman win.

203
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,467
- We have fried fish fillets.

204
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,700
- Fish?
- I like some fish.

205
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,867
- There's a little concern in
my mind about Mystique leading.

206
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,500
- We're gonna have you as
Disco Critter.

207
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,600
You have this line
and you have that line,

208
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,834
then that's it.

209
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,867
- I picked Jessica because
I didn't want her

210
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,934
to have a part where she has
to actually listen

211
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,400
to everybody mingle in with
everybody.

212
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
You don't know that much
English.

213
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
- All right.

214
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,300
- Ellie Mae?

215
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,467
- I'm a chameleon, darling.

216
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,800
I can do whatever I need to.

217
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,300
- Aunt Judy Faye,
and Baby Girl.

218
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,667
- Baby Girl.

219
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,333
- Who wants to do
Aunt Judy Faye?

220
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,800
I asked the girls who they felt
they wanted to do.

221
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,467
Then I made the executive
decision.

222
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,133
Do you want to do Ellie Mae?
- Yeah.

223
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,066
- Do you want to do the baby?
- Doesn't matter.

224
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,367
- I think she has more
of a baby face.

225
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,533
- I do too.
- I'll be the baby.

226
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,867
I'll be the baby.

227
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,433
- Everyone wanted to be
something, you know, fun,

228
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,200
something, you know, pretty.

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,066
- Disco Critter, do you want
to do that part?

230
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,467
- You're gonna be, like,
a chicken.

231
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,467
- A chicken.

232
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,700
- So I get the Disco Critter,

233
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,166
which is a fucking chicken.

234
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,734
And it really pissed me off.

235
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,967
- Okay, so Raven
has Disco Critter.

236
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:10,367
Raven is the best makeup artist
in this competition by far.

237
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,867
I knew that Raven would be able
to execute the character

238
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,333
with her personality
and her makeup skills.

239
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,767
- Yeah, I'm gonna be
a fucking chicken.

240
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,200
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

241
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,700
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.

242
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,934
Welcome to another home...

243
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,667
- Do you need help
learning that?

244
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,700
- What?

245
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,567
- Do you need help
learning that?

246
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,467
- No, no.
- Okay, okay.

247
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,867
- The girls said,
"We give the chicken

248
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,266
because don't talk a lot."

249
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:40,800
At the end, I realize
the chicken talk a lot.

250
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,066
Welcome to another
home-fry meal.

251
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,767
- Mystique decides to give
Jessica

252
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,667
the opening and closing
monologues, I'll say.

253
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,934
They weren't just lines.

254
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,500
- Shortening?

255
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
- Shortening.
- Shortening?

256
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,133
Shortening.
- Shortenin'.

257
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,166
- Shortenin'.

258
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,100
- I'm kind of scared.

259
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,367
- [groaning]

260
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,166
-<i> Uh, I hope this don't</i>
<i>fall apart.</i>

261
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,533
- The main challenge today
is to put on a commercial

262
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,367
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.

263
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,667
- Oh, Auntie, I just had the
worst day of my life.

264
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,700
- Ellie Mae,
why ya in such a state?

265
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,500
- We only had about three hours
to learn the lines.

266
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
- It's that mean
Billie Joe McAllister.

267
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
He's been picking on me all day.

268
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,166
My biggest worry for the team

269
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,834
at this time is just getting
the lines in.

270
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,700
Mystique, she's working
double time.

271
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,166
both: Disco Extra-Greasy.

272
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,300
- I think Mystique's doing
a fabulous job.

273
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,133
I am surprised.

274
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,233
I like her a lot.

275
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,700
- Greasy--
- [hissing]

276
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,600
- So are you happy
with who you picked?

277
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,300
- Yes. I think
this is the best team.

278
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,433
Mystique, she fucking swallowed
that basket like the only one.

279
00:10:56,433 --> 00:11:01,066
- She took the basket
and went "gulp."

280
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,700
- Words are words.

281
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,066
People think words don't hurt
'cause they're just words,

282
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:08,934
but when you hear it
every day...

283
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,700
Fuck everybody else.

284
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,100
- Okay, everybody.
One more time.

285
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,066
Go ahead, Jessica.

286
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,266
- Anna Grain--
Grain Annie?

287
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,266
- Granny.

288
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,700
- "Granny ain't," right?

289
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,066
- No, Granny's separate.

290
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,834
Granny is just one person.

291
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,233
- Oh, Aunt Judy.

292
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:27,166
Always in my life, when I want
something, it's not easy,

293
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:32,100
but I am going to keep going,
and I am going to work.

294
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,967
- Howdy.

295
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:38,066
all: Howdy-do, Ru?

296
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,100
- So this is the McCoys,
isn't it?

297
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,266
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,300
- The Real McCoys.

299
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,400
You think you know your lines?
- Yes.

300
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
- I'd love to hear 'em.

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal,

302
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,066
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.

303
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,467
- Auntie, what's for dinner?

304
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,300
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.

305
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,233
- Why, it's so delicious.

306
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,900
- And crispy too.

307
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,166
- And crispy too!

308
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,200
- Now, McCoys,
what's your biggest concern

309
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,834
going into this challenge?

310
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,600
- My group from the previous
challenge was in the bottom.

311
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,900
- Right.

312
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,467
- And now that I'm team leader,

313
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,100
I don't want my group to be
in the bottom.

314
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm up on the chopping block.

315
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,500
If I'm in the bottom group,
then I'm up for elimination.

316
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,633
You know?

317
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:19,133
And I think the person in charge
should be...

318
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,567
- Are you basing your characters
on people

319
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,934
in real life or television?

320
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,066
- My mom.

321
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,667
I'm just kidding.

322
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,233
- Is it a sexy Disco Critter?

323
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,333
- It's a fun, funky, fresh,

324
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,467
and country Disco Critter.

325
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,567
But it's gonna be more
of, like, a...

326
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,400
I guess you could say a--
a chicken.

327
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,467
- Uh-huh.

328
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,567
- It's a chicken.

329
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,834
There's no way
to make this pretty.

330
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,433
- All right, McCoys, well,
carry on.

331
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,066
I'll let you finish
getting ready.

332
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,100
- I'm really confident.
I think we're gonna win.

333
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,567
- Well, hello, Hatfields.

334
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,166
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi!

335
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,367
- Come on over and talk to me.

336
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:54,367
I want to hear about
your characterizations.

337
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,800
Now, I asked the other kids

338
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,066
to do an impromptu
table reading.

339
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,700
You think you're prepared enough
to do one for me?

340
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,233
- I'm not ready.

341
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,600
- And action.

342
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,533
- Welcome to another m--

343
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,166
Ugh.

344
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,500
Welcome to another fried, hot,

345
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,066
meal.

346
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,600
The...

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,500
Ooh.

348
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,066
- It's that
Billie Joe McAllister.

349
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,667
He...

350
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,467
He says I like fish.

351
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:34,066
- Every Hatfield woman does.

352
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,500
She does,
and there's another line.

353
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,567
Ain't that right, Granny?

354
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,934
- That's right.

355
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,433
We all love fish.

356
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:46,300
- I don't know if it was just
the pressure of doing it

357
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,367
in front of RuPaul, but it just
really just flopped.

358
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:53,400
- Still a little bit
underprepared for the challenge.

359
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,934
Jessica, did you choose
your role,

360
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,333
or was your role assigned
to you?

361
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,800
- No, my leader.

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,900
- And you chose Jessica
to have a role

363
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,066
with so many lines because...

364
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,233
- I know she'll turn it out
and have fun with it.

365
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,133
- Uh-huh.

366
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,266
- I'm nervous that if we fail,

367
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,867
I'm gonna go down,
because I'm the captain.

368
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,867
I'm responsible for everything.

369
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,767
- McCoys, can you come over
to this table?

370
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,333
Gather round, kids.

371
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,800
Ladies, in a moment, you'll be

372
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,400
shooting your commercials.

373
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,500
And I'm sending in a pro
to help coach you

374
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,934
with your performances.

375
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,333
You'll be working with
our special guest judge

376
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,066
Kathy Najimy.

377
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,100
- Whoo!

378
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,700
- One last thing.

379
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,600
There's a little twist.

380
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,266
I want you to swap scripts.

381
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,800
So now the Hatfields
will be the McCoys,

382
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,166
and the McCoys will be
the Hatfields.

383
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,433
- She switches
the fucking scripts.

384
00:14:56,433 --> 00:15:00,266
- Sorry for the last-minute
change, but that's showbiz.

385
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,066
- We're definitely gagging.

386
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:08,066
- Don't fuck it up, y'all.

387
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,066
Bye.

388
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,900
all: Bye.

389
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,066
- It really pissed me off.

390
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,066
Because we're now having
to not only

391
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,066
learn new lines
but get dressed.

392
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,367
Oh.

393
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,200
- Here we go.
Let's start again.

394
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,934
- This is gonna separate
the girls from the women, honey.

395
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:29,300
- It's time for Team McCoy
to do our commercial.

396
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,700
We look ugly, fabulous,
and we're owning it.

397
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,567
- Oh, how "purdy" you are.

398
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,266
Of course you know Kathy Najimy.

399
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,300
- Hi.

400
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
- She will be directing

401
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,834
the commercial for you all.

402
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,266
- All right,
we're gonna kick butt

403
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,300
on this, okay, you guys?

404
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,667
- I can't believe
she's standing

405
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,166
in the same room that I'm in.

406
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,300
I'm just--I just want to pee
everywhere, just soak myself.

407
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
- Here we go, people.

408
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,734
- I am going to feel that I am

409
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,967
a<i> pollo,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
so the chicken enter fierce.

410
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,100
- Take one.

411
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,367
- Hi!

412
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,200
Welcome to another
home-fried meal

413
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,533
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening!

414
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,600
- Cut.
That was great.

415
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,233
Go a little slower,
'cause we really

416
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,600
want to understand
what you're saying. Okay.

417
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,066
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal!

418
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:15,967
- Wait, can you stop?
Can we cut?

419
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,367
Can you--
is it "home-fried male"?

420
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,100
Is it "home-fried male"?
- Home-fried meal.

421
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,300
- Meal. Okay.
-<i> Comida!</i>

422
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,367
- Thought she was gonna
fry up a boy.

423
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,767
- Hi!

424
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:29,066
Welcome to another
home-fried meal!

425
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,066
- Howdy, Auntie.

426
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,667
What's for dinner?

427
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,767
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.

428
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,433
- Is it a Tic Tac?
- Cut.

429
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,400
Ellie Mae--everything she's
saying

430
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,700
should be sex, sex, sex,

431
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,633
even though she's saying
something else.

432
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,834
- What's for dinner?

433
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,600
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.

434
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,533
- Auntie, I want you to chain
smoke through the whole thing.

435
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:51,066
- It's Granny McCoy's famous
fried chicken.

436
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,066
- Cut.

437
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,166
Lots of energy, people.

438
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,700
- What is it, Auntie?

439
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,066
- Oh, please tell her.

440
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,367
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.

441
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,400
When I'm on stage performing,

442
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,934
I tend to use my body a lot,
and this was all face.

443
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:08,066
That Ellie Mae's dumber than
a box of rocks, ain't she?

444
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,567
- Baby, can you make a tiny bit
of a more baby voice?

445
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,333
- Like this?
- Yeah.

446
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,867
- Oh, please tell her.

447
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:18,266
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.

448
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,367
- I lost my line.

449
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay, I got it. I got it.
I got it.

450
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,533
- And go.
Action.

451
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,066
- Shit.
I really did lose it this time.

452
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,066
Wait. Hold on.

453
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,900
- We just need
to pick up the speed.

454
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,633
We only have 30 minutes.

455
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:35,667
- My secret ingredient
is Disco Greasy Shortening.

456
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,900
- And cut.

457
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,533
- That's a real moment
that she could take.

458
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,600
- Yeah.

459
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,667
Grandma, when she says
"something special,"

460
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,867
give me a little of this.

461
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,066
Like, "Of course
you got something special."

462
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,967
- That's the same age I was

463
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,100
when I won your cousin's heart

464
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,734
thanks to Granny's
special ingredient.

465
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:53,834
- Cut.

466
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:57,667
- Granny didn't beam with pride
when...

467
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,500
- When I said the thing,
which is the third time.

468
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,300
Does not take direction well.

469
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,767
Grandma, if you don't
turn your head

470
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,266
when they say
"special ingredient,"

471
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:09,066
I'm gonna run through this thing
and turn it for you.

472
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,100
You have a minute to show
America who your characters are,

473
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,767
so you have to really
pump 'em up.

474
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:14,900
- I'm super stoked.

475
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,266
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.

476
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,266
- Cut.

477
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,567
Critter, we need more energy

478
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,667
and comedy from you, 'cause you
are in a chicken outfit,

479
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,200
but you're doing a very--
sort of a Meryl Streep thing.

480
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,066
Let's think of a chicken voice.

481
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,900
- I'm thinking the whole time

482
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,500
country accent, Southern accent,

483
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,667
and then I'm told,
"Don't do that;

484
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,934
sound like a chicken."

485
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:36,367
Welcome to another fun-filled
evening--oh, shit.

486
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,066
- Exit and come on again.

487
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,233
- Marker.

488
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,767
- Welcome to another--

489
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,066
oh, shit.

490
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,667
I think I could sell ice
to an Eskimo

491
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,433
but not dressed as
a fucking chicken.

492
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,433
- Chicken, did you do your own
makeup?

493
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,066
'Cause you look a little like
the Joker.

494
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,500
It's scaring me a little bit.

495
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,967
I always like the funny.

496
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,767
- I realize that you're
directing us,

497
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:01,066
but at the same time, like,
make it seem a little more fun.

498
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:01,967
- Marker.

499
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,734
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal

500
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,266
courtesy of Disco's Extra--

501
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,367
- Cut. Disco.

502
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,166
Remember,
the money is "Disco."

503
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,834
- Every take, they were telling
her to be energetic,

504
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,066
be energetic.

505
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,734
They should only
have to tell you one time.

506
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:15,767
- [imitating crying]

507
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,233
- Oh, what's happening?

508
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,967
- Oh, Auntie--
- Cut.

509
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:23,100
Ellie Mae, when you're
coming in, it's--

510
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,800
I feel like you just saw
an alien

511
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
or there's something crawling up
your bottom.

512
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,266
Ellie Mae, she's just all sex
and sad

513
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,767
but not totally freaked out.

514
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,133
- Sexy sad.
- Sexy sad.

515
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,400
And you are the sexiest thing
in the world, right?

516
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,200
You know how to do that.

517
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,667
- Oh, Auntie.

518
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:42,066
I just had the worst day ever.

519
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,633
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.

520
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,934
Who's gonna tell her that
she smells like fish?

521
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,734
- 'Course you like eating fish.

522
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,667
All the Hatfield women do.

523
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,734
- Cut.

524
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,400
Auntie, what's your character,
honey?

525
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,500
- She thinks
she's kind of the boss.

526
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,066
- Okay, then more of that.
- Okay.

527
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,300
- And then, Baby,

528
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,166
I was gonna tell you to do
a high voice but don't.

529
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,867
You go lower and deeper
and madder.

530
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,967
It's hilarious.

531
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,467
You're the baby
just out of prison.

532
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,800
I love it.
- [laughs]

533
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,934
- Billie Joe says
it ain't natural

534
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:10,000
to like fish
so much.

535
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,100
- Well, that's because
he hasn't had a taste

536
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,867
of Granny Hatfield's
fresh fried fish.

537
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,166
- Auntie, meaner and louder.

538
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,400
- Sonique kept falling
in and out of character.

539
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,066
She didn't stay in character
when the cameras were rolling.

540
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,166
- Do it again.

541
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,600
- The quickest way
to a man's heart

542
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,200
is through his stomach.

543
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,667
- Especially when I make it

544
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,467
with Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.

545
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,633
- Okay, take it back.

546
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,900
Faster, louder,
and, Granny, turn towards me.

547
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,767
You're really funny,
but I want to see you.

548
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,266
Feel it.
You are your characters.

549
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,367
- You should invite Billie Joe
over here

550
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,533
so he can get a taste
of my fish.

551
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:49,367
- With Disco, you'll get there
in no time.

552
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,367
[record scratches]

553
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,500
- Granny, did you really

554
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,100
just put shortening
in your crotch?

555
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,934
- Morgan--
she wasn't funny at all.

556
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,066
She was crude.

557
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,533
- A little less
with the crotch shots,

558
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,367
just 'cause
it's a family commercial.

559
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,367
Okay, Baby,
don't change a thing.

560
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:07,433
- He says I like eating fish.

561
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,166
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.

562
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,900
- It is awful good.

563
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,633
both: And crispy too.

564
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:15,300
- Mmm-mmm!

565
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
- Great.
- Good job.

566
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,767
- I'm happy, and I'm confident
with what my team did,

567
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,133
and hopefully the judges
will see that.

568
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,133
- Good work, Hatfields
and McCoys.

569
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,200
Now, as Kathy knows,
in show business,

570
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,667
the last shot of the day
is called the martini shot,

571
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,967
and this is yours.

572
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,667
Please enjoy
some Absolut cocktails.

573
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:38,934
Now, dolls, you were asked
to bring your best country duds

574
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:42,133
from home, and tomorrow you'll
get the chance

575
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,433
to wear them
on the main stage.

576
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:48,967
We'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judge,

577
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,333
country legend Tanya Tucker.

578
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,500
- I love Tanya Tucker.

579
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,166
Her fashion is fierce.

580
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,533
- Whoo!

581
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,200
- The theme of tonight's
runway presentation

582
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,367
is country couture,

583
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,633
country glamour,
country realness.

584
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,533
- The only country I know
is my aunt,

585
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,567
and she's, like,
the most country-est person

586
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:10,700
in the world.

587
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,867
But she has so many
personalities.

588
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,066
So I'm like,
"I want to give

589
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,066
all the versions of my aunt
in one."

590
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,834
But this isn't country,
right?

591
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:21,667
- Depends on what kind of
country look you're going for.

592
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,066
- The first time that I ever
did drag in front of my friends

593
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:26,467
in high school was during
this Halloween party.

594
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,066
I thought I looked sexy, girl,

595
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:32,066
and then I--yeah, no.

596
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:34,834
I had, like, this afro on,
balloon boobies.

597
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:35,800
My best friend--

598
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,967
- You did balloon boobies too?

599
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,433
- I sure did.

600
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,700
- Girl, no, I have never done

601
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
drag in high school.

602
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,233
- I did drag in middle school.

603
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,467
- Girl, we know.

604
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,166
You came out the womb
putting on makeup.

605
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,166
- I know.

606
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,100
- Do you feel like a woman,

607
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,433
or do you feel
like a drag queen?

608
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,467
- A little bit of both.

609
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,967
I mean, when you're in drag,
don't--

610
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,567
you don't just feel
like a drag queen.

611
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,700
Sometimes you might feel

612
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,133
a little bit more womanly
one day.

613
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,667
You might feel a little bit
more fierce.

614
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,533
- I feel like a drag queen
when I'm in drag.

615
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:00,367
- I feel like a performer,
and that's it.

616
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,533
- Girl, your cheeks
are really ashy.

617
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:03,867
- What, right here?
- Yeah.

618
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,567
- Girl, I haven't dust yet.

619
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,066
- Uh, it's obvious.
You cooking?

620
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,133
- It's on slow roast.

621
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,734
Like that chicken we have.

622
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:11,867
- Best chicken, Granny.

623
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,467
- It's all in this can.

624
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,834
- She like,
"It's all in this can!"

625
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,066
- The reason
why I started doing drag

626
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:28,700
is because I always thought
I was cute.

627
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,600
I have never in my life
been told I was cute as a guy.

628
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,734
Never.

629
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,066
Mystique is pretty.

630
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,667
Everybody loves Mystique.

631
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,967
- I look around the room.

632
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,433
I see everybody looks like
a country diva.

633
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:45,066
And then I see
what Mystique is wearing.

634
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:50,100
She looks like she's a big girl
going out to a club.

635
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,934
I don't think the hat goes
with the outfit...

636
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,400
- Yeah, I know.
- Personally.

637
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,300
But you're a queen yourself,
so you choose.

638
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,934
Mm-mm.

639
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,066
[RuPaul laughing]

640
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,967
[applause]

641
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,233
- Oh, my Lord.

642
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,700
- Hi, everyone.

643
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,066
Santino, how are you, baby?

644
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:25,667
- What's that flower you got on?

645
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,734
- I feel like an ice-cold glass

646
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,133
of country-style lemonade.

647
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:31,367
[laughter]

648
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:33,266
- Pink lemonade.

649
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,467
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have

650
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,400
Miss Tanya Tucker
in the house tonight.

651
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,233
- Whoo!

652
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,400
- Thank you so much.

653
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
- Oh, love it.

654
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,767
Hey, Miss Kathy.

655
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:42,800
- Hello, my darling.

656
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,767
- This week we asked the ladies

657
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,734
to put the charisma, uniqueness,

658
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,767
nerve, and talent
back in country

659
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,700
as two feuding teams

660
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,066
to shoot a TV commercial for
Disco Extra-Greasy Shortening.

661
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,266
Tonight, they come
to the main stage

662
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:02,200
decked out in their best
denim and diamond couture.

663
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,100
Judges, are you ready to see
what they turned out?

664
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,166
- Ready.
- Whoo-hoo.

665
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,467
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

666
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:12,200
And may the best woman win.

667
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,633
Sonique.

668
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:20,166
-<i> Sonique is everything</i>
<i>that I feel on the inside.</i>

669
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,166
<i>When you feel good</i>
<i>on the inside, it shows.</i>

670
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,266
- Wow.
- She's working it.

671
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:25,433
A little Tanya Tucker.

672
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,700
- Yeah.

673
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,333
- Ooh.

674
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,166
- The devil went down
to Georgia.

675
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,567
Jujubee.

676
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,934
-<i> During my runway,</i>
<i>all I can think about is,</i>

677
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,433
<i>"Mama, you have to hit this."</i>

678
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,767
- She's popping her cherry
again?

679
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,367
- She's popping her cherry
again.

680
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:44,734
Raven.

681
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,133
- That's so not Raven.

682
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,533
- I know, right?
- Yeah, the Guess girl.

683
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,667
- I've never seen her
so sweet-looking.

684
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,900
-<i> I feel adorable.</i>

685
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
<i>Like a cherry</i>
<i>on top of a cupcake.</i>

686
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,467
- The girl next door.

687
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,600
- Well, next door to what?

688
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,433
- Best little whorehouse
in Texas.

689
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,266
[laughter]

690
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,467
- Sahara.

691
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:05,500
That much leg
should be against the law.

692
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,734
-<i> I'm a dancer, so of course</i>
<i>I'm gonna try</i>

693
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,066
<i>and incorporate that</i>
<i>every chance I get.</i>

694
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>A little bootin',</i>
<i>a little shuffle.</i>

695
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,500
- Y'all come back now, ya hear?

696
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,734
All right, Mommy.

697
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,834
-<i> I wanted to do country,</i>

698
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,767
<i>but I wanted it to have</i>
<i>an urban twist.</i>

699
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,300
- It's kind of like Raquel Welch
went to the country.

700
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,266
- Well, you know, it's hard
to keep 'em on the farm

701
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:28,300
after they've been
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

702
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,367
- That's hard.

703
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,600
- Pandora Boxx.

704
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,367
Cowgirl hall of fame.

705
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:38,433
-<i> I'm feeling like my outfit</i>
<i>is cute and country.</i>

706
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:41,300
- This ain't her first time at
the rodeo.

707
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,967
- Even cowgirls get the blues.

708
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,934
- Oh.

709
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:48,233
Jessica Wild.

710
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,233
-<i> I feel good</i>
<i>because I feel sexy.</i>

711
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:54,367
<i>I feel that</i>
<i>I am in the country.</i>

712
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:57,300
- Our little Jessica's
growing up.

713
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,433
She's filling out her jeans.

714
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,066
Her Apple Bottom jeans.

715
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,567
Mystique.

716
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,667
Star Jones before the pilates.

717
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,467
-<i> My strategy in the game</i>
<i>is pretty much to stand out.</i>

718
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:12,367
<i>To be totally different</i>
<i>from everybody else.</i>

719
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,200
<i>So it can work in my favor.</i>

720
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,300
- Yes, yes.

721
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,867
Uh-huh.
And do-si-do, Mama.

722
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,467
Morgan McMichaels.

723
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:21,633
The look of today's
country girl.

724
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,300
- Kind of new,
romantic country.

725
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,967
-<i> I think there's just</i>
<i>a one-track mind</i>

726
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:26,266
<i>about what country is.</i>

727
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:29,200
<i>You don't have to be Podunk</i>
<i>to be country.</i>

728
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,734
- Aren't they gorgeous,
those boots?

729
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:35,066
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

730
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:37,166
-<i> I try to give the judges</i>

731
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,500
<i>another side of me every week.</i>

732
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,066
- Whoo!
- Flip off that skirt!

733
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,600
- Whoo!

734
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
- I'll change
at the gas station, Mama.

735
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,166
You won't even know.

736
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,567
- Wow.
Oh, yes.

737
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,100
Now she's Super Tyra.

738
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,100
I'll take one in every color.

739
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,333
Hello, my country queens.

740
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,934
Let's take a look
at the world premiere

741
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:05,600

742
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,433

<i>What's for dinner?</i>

746
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:20,233
-<i> It's your favorite--</i>

747

<i>Granny McCoy's</i>

749
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:32,367
-<i> Ain't that Disco Extra-Greasy</i>

00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:35,166

- Our commercial was hilarious.

760
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,834
I loved it.

761
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,934

-<i> Oh, Auntie.</i>

766
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>It's that mean</i>
<i>Billie Joe McAllister.</i>

767
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,100
<i>He been picking on me all day.</i>

768
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,367
<i>He says I like eating fish.</i>

769
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,700

770
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,800
<i>Who's gonna tell her that</i>

771
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,433

784
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:16,800
- So Hatfields, McCoys,

785
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,133
both of your commercials
have highlights

786
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,700
and lowlights.

787
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,767
But I do have a favorite.

788
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:33,900
And that is...

789
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,467
The McCoys.

790
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,467
Good work.

791
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,533
[applause]

792
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:45,166
Now this week,
we had you work as teams.

793
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,433
But tonight each of you

794
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,500
will be judged
on your individual performance.

795
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,867
In other words,
no one is safe.

796
00:30:56,567 --> 00:31:00,500
When I call your name,
please step forward.

797
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,266
Sonique.

798
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,600
Jujubee.

799
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,066
Morgan McMichaels.

800
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,900
Tatianna.

801
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,633
Sahara Davenport.

802
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:21,633
You girls, you are safe.

803
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:23,233
Congratulations.

804
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,600
You may leave the stage.

805
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,066
The five of you represent

806
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,166
the best and the worst
of the week.

807
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,834
Let's begin
our judges' critiques.

808
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,133
Let's start with Raven.

809
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,200
- I did think the performance

810
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,467
was a little
all over the map.

811
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,834
- It was kind of a mixed bag.

812
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,800
I didn't actually know
if you knew

813
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,900
that you were kind of playing
an animal or a chicken.

814
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
- Well, when we were practicing,

815
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,700
I didn't realize that
I should do it as a chicken.

816
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,500
- What did you think
you were gonna do it as?

817
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,066
- Well, do the voice
as a chicken.

818
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,066
- Now, Kathy,
you directed Raven in the piece.

819
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,900
- I directed Raven
in the piece.

820
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
PS, you look so cute.

821
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,100
I could put you in a smoothie
and drink you.

822
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,867
But I also sense
a real seriousness about you.

823
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,233
Honey, you have to look
around you.

824
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,433
This is just a bowl
full of fun soup.

825
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:14,233
Lighten up a little bit
and have a good time.

826
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,800
- All right, next up,
Jessica Wild.

827
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,433
Show us your Apple Bottom jeans.

828
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,166
- My Apple Bottom...
- Hey.

829
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,233
- Yeah, I want to mount her.

830
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:25,266
You are giving thoroughbred
realness today.

831
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:26,834
[laughter]

832
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:29,400
- What'd you think of her
as the Disco Critter?

833
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,467
- I thought she did a good job
with your language.

834
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,233
I can barely speak English,
so...

835
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:37,400
- Put some crispy
in your cock a "doddle" doo!

836
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,300
I love my character
because I love the Muppets,

837
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,633
so I feel like I am a Muppet.

838
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:45,300
- Thank you, my dear.

839
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,700
Pandora Boxx,
did you make this outfit,

840
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,934
or did you buy it?

841
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,166
- Um, it's bought,
but then I took the fabric

842
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:54,233
that we had for all the costumes
and added the little lady.

843
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,867
- Ah, crafty.

844
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,066
- I love your outfit.

845
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,166
I love what you did to it.

846
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,467
And it kind of--
kind of reminds me of me.

847
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:02,633
- Santino.

848
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:03,967
- Oh.

849
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,166
I'm not gonna be your favorite.

850
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,433
It almost looks like

851
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,400
you're in a child pageant
or something.

852
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,834
I'm thinking, like, you read,
like, 12 or 13,

853
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:14,066
and then I'm, like--I'm just
kind of creeped out.

854
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:16,233
- I don't think Pandora
is a fashion girl.

855
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:19,367
But what I do get all over
from Pandora is comedy.

856
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,767
I thought you were
the funniest person, actually.

857
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,567
- The quickest way
to a man's heart

858
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,400
is through his stomach.

859
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,233
- It was definitely fun to do.

860
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,533
It was kind of my element.

861
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,834
- Very funny.

862
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,633
Mystique Summers Madison.

863
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:35,066
Are you feeling Southern?

864
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:38,934
- I went with how my friends
back home dressed as,

865
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,533
since they're country.

866
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:41,967
- Well, I hear
what you're saying,

867
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,667
but it's not really sort of
the country look.

868
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,900
- I want to stand out
by going as

869
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
the normal, mall-wear country.

870
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,967
- [laughs]

871
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,066
- As the country girls--where--

872
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,867
where they still can have on
a nice shirt.

873
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,100
- Isn't this the same top

874
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
you wore in the challenge,
though?

875
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,900
- Yes, this is a skirt,
a one-piece skirt.

876
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,734
And I made it more updated

877
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,834
with the gauchos
and everything.

878
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,834
- Why the fuck
did you wear that

879
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,100
and try and make up
some bullshit fucking story?

880
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,900
- I love the way you do
your runway.

881
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,567
I thought your runway
was great.

882
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,567
- It almost seems like
you're twirling even more

883
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:17,066
because you know that your
outfit is not working today.

884
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,967
- When you walked out just now,
I said,

885
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:23,934
"I totally forgot
that you're not female."

886
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:27,433
I just thought, "Well, there's
that gorgeous woman."

887
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:30,133
It's a bummer about the outfit.
That's a bummer.

888
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,066
- Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
Miss Thing.

889
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,567
- I think
some maybe had a hard time

890
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,333
coming up with one outfit.

891
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,667
You came up with three looks
that you gave us.

892
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,567
The only thing
I would ask you is,

893
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,433
when you transform into Tyra,

894
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,600
why doesn't your voice change?

895
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,934
- Well, I can't go higher.
I can try for you.

896
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,133
- What's the highest note
you can hit?

897
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,567
- Happy birthday,
Mr. President.

898
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,467
- Happy birthday, Mr. President.

899
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:54,066
- That's--that's totally
believable.

900
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,600
- Let's talk about
your commercial.

901
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,700
You played the baby.

902
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,867
- I actually thought about
my own son.

903
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:01,066
He wakes up
in the middle of the night

904
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,233
out of nowhere and just like,
"Can I have some water?"

905
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,500
And by the time
I get the water

906
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,600
and bring it back to him,
he's asleep again.

907
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,734
- Well, all right.

908
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,567
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

909
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,967
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

910
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,233
the judges and I
will deliberate.

911
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,600
Thank you.

912
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,433
[engine starts]

913
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,100
Let's talk about Mystique.

914
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,667
- She's got that
really pretty face.

915
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,467
The only problem I had
was the outfit.

916
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,200
- Yeah.
- So far off the mark.

917
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,233
- Yeah.

918
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,767
- Stood out
in all the wrong ways.

919
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,367
- That outfit--
that was inexcusable.

920
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:33,300
- Yeah.

921
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,667
- And then having to explain
why...

922
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,600
[laughs]
Not good. Not good.

923
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,800
Okay, so we're gonna go on
over to Tyra.

924
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,166
She's a gorgeous gal.
- Yes.

925
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,200
- She's clearly inventive
with her presentation.

926
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,433
Do you think Tyra's voice
is working against her?

927
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,600
- I think just a little bit.

928
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,633
- She has a very deep voice.

929
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:49,900
- Because when you look at her,

930
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,633
there's nothing--
I can't see anything wrong.

931
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,533
- Yeah.
Let's talk about Raven.

932
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,934
Didn't do so well
in the commercial.

933
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,066
- I missed the funny.

934
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,667
Obviously
you're in a chicken suit.

935
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,467
That's the first clue
to be funny.

936
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,200
- Raven looked so beautiful
on the runway,

937
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,567
but I thought,
as the Disco Critter,

938
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,734
Jessica did a better job
than Raven did.

939
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,734
- Yes.

940
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,367
Jessica Wild
is from Puerto Rico,

941
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,066
doesn't speak the language
very well,

942
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:16,266
and she seemed to master
the Disco Critter very well.

943
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,333
- She just went wild.

944
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,800
- I find her really charming

945
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,700
and a great, spicy addition
to this lineup.

946
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,934
- Yes.

947
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:25,967
- But is she America's
next drag superstar?

948
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,467
That's the question
we have to ask.

949
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,367
- I don't know.
- Pandora Boxx.

950
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,667
Santino had an issue...

951
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:31,767
- Hate, hate.

952
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,066
- With Pandora Boxx's outfit.

953
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,700
- It's just very just,
uh, pedestrian.

954
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,266
- She is a fantastic comedienne.

955
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:39,567
- My favorite to work with.

956
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:42,667
She's got--she's got
some comedy going.

957
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,667
- Silence.

958
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,133
I've made my decision.

959
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:48,200
Bring back the girls.

960
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:53,667
Ladies, welcome back.

961
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:57,767
Pandora, if you want to win
this race,

962
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,467
you need to step up your style.

963
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,734
You're safe.

964
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:04,533
You may join the other girls.

965
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:10,066
Mystique, you were slow
to make adjustments on set

966
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,500
during the commercial.

967
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,266
When we asked you to give us
your best country couture,

968
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:19,066
you came up empty-handed.

969
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,233
I'm sorry.

970
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:23,433
You're up for elimination.

971
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:25,633
- I knew this was probably
gonna happen this way.

972
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:28,200
They didn't see me as
their version

973
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
of country realness.

974
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,767
You can't please everybody.

975
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:34,266
- Jessica.

976
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:37,066
You're safe.

977
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,066
You may join the other girls.

978
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,166
Raven.

979
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:44,633
I see flashes of star power
in you.

980
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:48,066
But as quickly as it comes,
it fades away.

981
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,333
Do you have the consistency

982
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,600
to be the next
drag superstar?

983
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,467
I'm sorry, but you're up for
elimination.

984
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,533
- So once again
I'm in the bottom two.

985
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,867
Honestly, I don't feel like

986
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,567
I belong in the bottom two
with Mystique.

987
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:10,266
- Tyra Sanchez,
your runway was a hit.

988
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,467
And your Baby Girl
made me laugh out loud.

989
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:16,266
Congratulations.

990
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:18,066

of this challenge.

998
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,400

that I won,

999
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,667
and I feel great.

1000
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:41,767
I feel amazing.

1001
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,433
Because last week they were
making me out

1002
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,533
to be a bitch of the group.

1003
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,066
And I'm not a bitch.

1004
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:48,133
I'm America's sweetheart.

I've consulted with the judges.

1007
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,967
But the final decision
is mine to make.

1008
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:06,500
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1009
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,300
and save yourself
from elimination.

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,166
The time has come

1011
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:17,333

to lip synch for your life.

00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:37,467
I'm gonna be Mystique.

1057
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,500
<i>Take me as I am</i>
<i>or nothing at all.</i>

1058
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,734
<i>So I'm going home</i>
<i>with my head held up high.</i>

1059
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,400
- Dolls, like every good
country song,

1060
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,433
we will live through
this heartache.

1061
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,800
Mystique is gone,
but we will carry on

1062
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,734
in the tradition
of all great country queens.

1063
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:56,133
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1064
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:58,200
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

1065
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,100
Can I get an amen in here?

1066
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,066
all: Amen.

1067
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:03,233
- Let the music play!

humping a dolphin?

179
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,500
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

180
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,633
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

181
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,967
&gt;&gt; I don't know how natural
that is,

182
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:23,367
but somehow I'm strangely
stimulated by it.

183
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,400
Ladies.

184
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,533
You all had fun
with this challenge.

185
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:31,433
But...

186
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,867
I'm gonna have to go with Raja.

187
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,200
&gt;&gt; Oh, shit!

188
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,700
&gt;&gt; Raja is the winner of this
mini-challenge.

189
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,834
[laughing]

190
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,700
&gt;&gt; She can jump around
and celebrate everything

191
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,200
that she wants to,
but I won too.

192
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,767
Hey.

193
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,066
&gt;&gt; Ladies.

194
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:49,900
A queen's crowning glory
is her hair.

195
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,467
Now I'm gonna give you
an opportunity

196
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,633
to really wig out.

197
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:56,700
[cheers and applause]

198
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
&gt;&gt; Oh, God.

199
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,734
&gt;&gt; Oh.

200
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,133
&gt;&gt; For this week's
main challenge,

201
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,333
you'll be competing
in a fantasy hair show.

202
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:08,166
You need to create
three distinct hairstyles.

203
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:12,367
First, a classic look
from another era.

204
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,333
Second, a modern look

205
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,734
worthy of a red carpet event.

206
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:23,633
And third, a far-out fantasy
hair extravaganza.

207
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,266
&gt;&gt; Mmm, hey.

208
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,567
&gt;&gt; Now, Raja.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

209
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,934
&gt;&gt; Because you won
the mini-challenge,

210
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:33,100
you get a five-second head start
at the wig bar.

211
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
&gt;&gt; Oh!

212
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,600
&gt;&gt; Provided by Wilshire Wigs.

213
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,233
So get going.

214
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:43,433
Gentlemen, start your engines.

215
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:46,400
And may the best woman win!

216
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,333
&gt;&gt; [screams]

217
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,400
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

218
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
&gt;&gt; What are you doing?

219
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
The extravaganza?

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,633
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

221
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,133
That's the one
I'm gonna work on first,

222
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,500
'cause I think that'll
take me the most time.

223
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,600
She ain't slick.

224
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,867
I know what she's doing.

225
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,600
Yara is brushing that wig,
and walking around,

226
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,166
looking at
everyone's creations.

227
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,066
Getting ideas.

228
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,200
What am I gonna do?

229
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,533
Hmm.

230
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,867
&gt;&gt; I love doing hair.

231
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,867
&gt;&gt; I think Yara's gonna do
really good at this one.

232
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:17,867
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

233
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,100
&gt;&gt; 'Cause you always have, like,

234
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,500
the craziest, wackiest hair.

235
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,767
&gt;&gt; And Manila, how do you think

236
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm gonna do with this
challenge?

237
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,300
&gt;&gt; Um, I think you'll do fine.

238
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,166
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

239
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,533
&gt;&gt; Shangela, this is a comb.

240
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,867
&gt;&gt; Ooh, girl!

241
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:32,867
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

242
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,500
&gt;&gt; It goes through the hairs.

243
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,467
Mm-hmm.

244
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,533
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Manila.

245
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,233
&gt;&gt; Just sharing the knowledge,
Honey.

246
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,800
&gt;&gt; These girls don't expect me
to have any creativity

247
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,433
or ability when it
comes to this.

248
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,333
It's a fire in me
to prove them wrong.

249
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,266
&gt;&gt; Our main challenge is
creating

250
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,834
three different looks
of hair,

251
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,333
matching with
three different outfits--

252
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,734
the classic from another era,

253
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,767
a modern red carpet look,

254
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:07,266
and then we have
a fantasy creation.

255
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,633
&gt;&gt; Alexis.

256
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,133
&gt;&gt; What happened, boo?

257
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,300
&gt;&gt; Which one are you working on
right now?

258
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,900
&gt;&gt; My fantasy look.

259
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,800
That's gonna be my hardest part
of the challenge--

260
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,300
is going to be
to get that look together.

261
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,266
I normally work with my own hair
as a base.

262
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,066
So I'm gonna have to see
how it goes tomorrow,

263
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,467
because I can
actually style the pieces

264
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,500
that I'm gonna wear.

265
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,600
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

266
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
&gt;&gt; But it's not until it's
on my head

267
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,967
that you actually see
the final product.

268
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,066
&gt;&gt; Right.

269
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,200
&gt;&gt; Alexis is probably gonna have

270
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,233
this weird-looking Elvis 
pompadour

271
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,533
with, like,
an<i> Avatar</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ponytail.</i>

272
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,734
I mean, this is what she does.

273
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,567
Shangela,<i> au naturale.</i>

274
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,200
Do you know what you're doing
for your era?

275
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
&gt;&gt; Donna Summer
meets Diana Ross.

276
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,567
&gt;&gt; Work.

277
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,934
&gt;&gt; Yara.
&gt;&gt; Huh?

278
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,433
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

279
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,633
&gt;&gt; This is my '80s look.

280
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:57,133
&gt;&gt; An '80s look?

281
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,367
&gt;&gt; Fros seem to be really 
popular for a classic era.

282
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,800
&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,066
&gt;&gt; Hola.
&gt;&gt; Hello.

284
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,100
&gt;&gt; Hi, how are things
shaping up?

285
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,300
&gt;&gt; Fierce, honey, fierce.

286
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,834
&gt;&gt; Well, hello there.

287
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,000
Alexis.

288
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,266
Which is your classic look?

289
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,900
&gt;&gt; I think I'm going for
the 1940s.

290
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,100
&gt;&gt; Well, now, during the '40s

291
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,233
there was a rationing
on latex titties.

292
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,700
&gt;&gt; Are you serious?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

293
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,800
&gt;&gt; '40s look.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

294
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,700
&gt;&gt; Do you have it here?

295
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,767
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; No?

296
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,900
What about your
red carpet hair?

297
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,467
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go for
the evening modern mohawk.

298
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,600
&gt;&gt; An evening
modern mohawk style.

299
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
And where's that?

300
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
&gt;&gt; It's not ready yet.

301
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
&gt;&gt; It's not ready yet?

302
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,467
Oh, Miss Thing.

303
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:46,233
Let's talk about your hair
fantasy-stravaganza.

304
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,000
&gt;&gt; I saw this pink,
and it reminded me

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,300
of that cotton candy
that you get

306
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,333
when you go to the circus.

307
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,433
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

308
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,133
&gt;&gt; And that's my inspiration,
the circus.

309
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,200
&gt;&gt; Your inspiration is
cotton candy from the circus.

310
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,467
&gt;&gt; For the circus.
&gt;&gt; Ah.

311
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,700
Hi, Shangela.

312
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,066
&gt;&gt; Hey, Ru.
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

313
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,300
Oh, this is
your hair fantasy?

314
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,400
&gt;&gt; This is it.

315
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,467
We're on it today.

316
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,767
&gt;&gt; Wow.

317
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of like
an alien princess

318
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,767
from the future.

319
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,100
&gt;&gt; It is quite the fantasy.

320
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,066
And you've got
your classic hair?

321
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,300
&gt;&gt; Classic hair is very
Diana Ross meets Donna Summer.

322
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,433
&gt;&gt; I'd love to wear that hair.

323
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,433
That is beautiful.

324
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,500
So you not being a hair queen,

325
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,433
are you asking for advice
from the other girls?

326
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,300
Just how to put things together?

327
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,867
&gt;&gt; No.

328
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,633
I know and I'm learning
what looks great on me.

329
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,834
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

330
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,800
&gt;&gt; And no one can tell you
what looks best on you

331
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,834
but yourself.

332
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,400
I mean, I know it's okay
to ask for help,

333
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,133
but I've kind of
gotten some feedback

334
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,166
from the other girls

335
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,667
that they're over me
asking for help.

336
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,900
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So I can do things on my own.

337
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,200
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

338
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,300
You got to, 'cause, you know,

339
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,333
we're down to the wire now.

340
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,333
&gt;&gt; That's right.

341
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,333
&gt;&gt; Yara Sofia.

342
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,700
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Hi, darling.

343
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,734
&gt;&gt; Hi, darling.

344
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,133
&gt;&gt; Tell me about your
classic hair look.

345
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,867
&gt;&gt; I made this with braids.

346
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,900
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

347
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,800
&gt;&gt; On the cover.

348
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,767
And I mixed two afros,
two tones.

349
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,767
&gt;&gt; I see.

350
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:03,900
&gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

351
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,233
You know, um, Shangela is doing
a little bit

352
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:10,500
of a--sort of a '70s afro.

353
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,200
It's big, curly hair.

354
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,967
Are you worried
about that at all?

355
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,600
&gt;&gt; No, well, I made it first.

356
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
And when I see Shangela's
classic hair,

357
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,266
it looks like mine.

358
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,700
Even the brunette color.

359
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,266
I think Shangela's a copycat.

360
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,800
&gt;&gt; Hey, Raja.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

361
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,767
&gt;&gt; So tell me,
what are you planning

362
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,667
for your red carpet look?

363
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,066
&gt;&gt; I am taking some inspiration
from Janice,

364
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,066
from the Muppets.

365
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,066
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

366
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,767
She's my favorite muppet,
I think.

367
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,133
&gt;&gt; [imitating Janice]
"Hey, man.

368
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,200
Yeah, it's gonna be cool."

369
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,166
&gt;&gt; Yeah, uh-huh.

370
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,867
Artistically,
what is your fantasy?

371
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,400
&gt;&gt; Well, my fantasy would never
really involve a wig,

372
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,133
'cause the wig would be
pulled off, but...

373
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,166
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

374
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,533
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, no...

375
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,700
I really don't know what my hair
fantasy is, to be honest.

376
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,800
&gt;&gt; Now, listen.

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,100
I just want you to know
that we expect something

378
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,233
truly out of this world.

379
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,400
&gt;&gt; Ru wants to see something

380
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,600
that's just gonna wow him

381
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,867
and, you know, take him
to another, like,

382
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,934
another realm, really.

383
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,066
And I definitely feel
a lot of pressure.

384
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,834
I am about to lose my mind.

385
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,200
&gt;&gt; Hey, Manila.

386
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,567
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

387
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,300
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; What you got there?

388
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,967
Sort of a rock me disco Amadeus,
isn't it?

389
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,867
&gt;&gt; This is my classic look.

390
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,367
&gt;&gt; That's your classic look.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

391
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,066
I thought it may be kind of cool
to do,

392
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:28,066
like, the mix of, like,
'80s meets 1800s.

393
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,500
&gt;&gt; This is not
your fantasy look?

394
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,467
&gt;&gt; This is my classic look.

395
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,633
&gt;&gt; 'Cause that's pretty fantasy.

396
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,633
That's--that's out there,
isn't it?

397
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,967
&gt;&gt; It's a lot to explain.

398
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,834
&gt;&gt; Some of the other girls
have gotten in trouble

399
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:40,066
for having to explain
what it is they're doing.

400
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,066
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

401
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,200
&gt;&gt; You know, it should be clear.

402
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,533
&gt;&gt; Hits you over the head.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

403
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,934
&gt;&gt; Make sure that everyone
gets it.

404
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:48,100
&gt;&gt; Well, to quote Alexis Mateo,
it should say, "Bam!"

405
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,066
&gt;&gt; The jig is up.

406
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,133
&gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying?

407
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,900
&gt;&gt; I will.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

408
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,800
&gt;&gt; All right, ladies.
Gather around.

409
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,900
Now tomorrow, we'll be joined by

410
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,500
our extra special guest judges--

411
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,200
the talented and hilarious
Wayne Brady...

412
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,066
&gt;&gt; Whoo!
&gt;&gt; Wow.

413
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,100
&gt;&gt; Brady.

414
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,066
&gt;&gt; And my favorite baby mama,
Fantasia.

415
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,633
For real.

416
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,066
No, for real, though.

417
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,367
I'm for real.

418
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,800
&gt;&gt; Fantasia won<i> American Idol,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and I can't wait.

419
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,667
&gt;&gt; In addition to debuting
your three hairstyles

420
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,834
on the main stage,

421
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,867
there's just one more
little detail

422
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,400
I neglected to mention.

423
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,567
I want you to create
a runway outfit

424
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:38,066
made entirely out of...

425
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:41,467
hair.

426
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:42,767
&gt;&gt; [gasping] Oh, my god.

427
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,767
What am I going to do?

428
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,333
&gt;&gt; You'll get more hair pieces,

429
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,533
toupees, falls, and merkins.

430
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,700
So y'all can really
get wiggy up in here.

431
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,433
&gt;&gt; Like, really, Ru?

432
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,400
Really?

433
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,934
&gt;&gt; Listen, the competition is

434
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,667
getting pretty hairy in here.

435
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,066
So don't fuck it up.

436
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,333
&gt;&gt; Our main challenge today
is that

437
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,400
we're creating three
different hair looks

438
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,166
that has to correspond
to three different outfits,

439
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,767
and we have to create an outfit
out of hair!

440
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,300
There's so much to do,
and so little time.

441
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,567
You can feel the pressure on.

442
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,967
&gt;&gt; We have to make a dress out
of nothing but wigs?

443
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,133
This is insane.

444
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,667
You gotta be kidding me.

445
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,800
&gt;&gt; It's crazy,
that's what it is.

446
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,433
&gt;&gt; That kind of changes
my whole, like, look.

447
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:32,667
&gt;&gt; Me too.

448
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,567
&gt;&gt; It's a giant challenge,
but yet it's like,

449
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,867
they tell you, like, later.

450
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:36,967
&gt;&gt; Isn't that crazy, though?

451
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,266
That there's always a twist?

452
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:42,066
Just when you think
you have it down.

453
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,233
&gt;&gt; Ooh!
Oh!

454
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,934
I almost melted my face.

455
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,667
Sabotage!

456
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,233
Ooh, girl!

457
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,834
It's jumping up in here.

458
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,533
[hysterical laughter]

459
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,767
&gt;&gt; Are you losing it, girl?

460
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,066
Quit sniffing all those
adhesive fumes.

461
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:01,300
Yara is being wacky.

462
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,934
&gt;&gt; [cursing in Spanish]

463
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,433
&gt;&gt; But a part of me goes,
"Is she doing that

464
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,600
to distract the other girls
in the room?"

465
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,667
Oh, okay.

466
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,767
Miss Girl's got a strategy
of her own.

467
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,734
&gt;&gt; ♪ Be-deep, be-deep ♪

468
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,200
♪ Be-deep, be-deep ♪

469
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,967
Ay! Ay! Ay!

470
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,967
&gt;&gt; Oh, Christ on crackers.

471
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:17,967
&gt;&gt; Aaiiee!

472
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:18,967
Oooh!

473
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,066
Aaah!

474
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:20,967
I mean, come on.

475
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:21,967
&gt;&gt; Hee-hee-hee!

476
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,066
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

477
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,467
&gt;&gt; Really?

478
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,734
&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm in some,
like, weird alien petting zoo.

479
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,934
It's, like, shut up.

480
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,500
&gt;&gt; If you guys had a chance

481
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,633
to kill one of the other queens
in this competition,

482
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:33,600
who would it be?

483
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,066
&gt;&gt; Yara Sofia.

484
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,133
&gt;&gt; I never win the challenge.

485
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,200
And this time, I have to win.

486
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,233
Fuck, it's about time for me.

487
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,667
Um, excuse me.

488
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,667
Excuse me.

489
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,433
Darling, I need help.

490
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,967
&gt;&gt; What, Yara, what?

491
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,433
&gt;&gt; Do you like the combination?

492
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:54,066
&gt;&gt; I like it, I like it since
you made it.

493
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,967
Yara is coming to my station
every five seconds

494
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,233
to ask me how her look is.

495
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,700
I mean, we're the top five.

496
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,734
Ain't no time to be
talking around

497
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,233
or playing with each other.

498
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:07,066
This is some real shit
right now.

499
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,066
You'll be all right.

500
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,400
&gt;&gt; I hope so.

501
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,266
&gt;&gt; If Carmen was still here--

502
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,300
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

503
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,834
&gt;&gt; She would have just taken
two wigs,

504
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,367
glued them to her titties.

505
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:19,934
&gt;&gt; Called it a day.

506
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,433
&gt;&gt; I'm always having problems

507
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,633
with the proportions of my body.

508
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,900
Um, the wrong way.

509
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,400
And this challenge, I have to
wear my body, plus hair.

510
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,967
So for me to actually have
a silhouette on stage,

511
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,533
it's gonna
be very difficult.

512
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:39,667
My fantasy dress was not going
to the right place

513
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:44,200
that I want it to.

514
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,567
&gt;&gt; Alexis finish her garment,

515
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:51,667
and now she's changing the dress
and cut it.

516
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,700
&gt;&gt; Oh, you changed it,
like, fiercely, huh?

517
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,367
&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like circus.

518
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,400
&gt;&gt; I was wondering why you cut
it all apart.

519
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,333
It's important for me to do well
in this challenge because,

520
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,834
bitch, it's the top five.

521
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:06,633
I mean, I wanna be
part of the top four.

522
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,800
&gt;&gt; It's good, but I don't know

523
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,100
if this could bother you.

524
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,433
&gt;&gt; I put it on so it sits,
like, right here.

525
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,433
Fits okay.

526
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,400
&gt;&gt; Can you glue hair?

527
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,133
&gt;&gt; This is a creative high
for me.

528
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,066
I don't want to look
outward for help.

529
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,266
&gt;&gt; It doesn't have to cover
the entire front.

530
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,433
&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome.

531
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,834
&gt;&gt; Just a design.

532
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,166
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

533
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,233
&gt;&gt; Shangela's outfit is a mess.

534
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,066
Hey, girl, listen.

535
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,500
You should learn
some new things.

536
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,066
&gt;&gt; Have you tried your wig
on yet?

537
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,300
&gt;&gt; I haven't even started it.

538
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,533
&gt;&gt; This is all good in theory,

539
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,600
but let's see if it
actually stays on my head.

540
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,166
&gt;&gt; This wig is, like, super,
like, Halloween-y.

541
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,700
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing anymore.

542
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,700
In<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history, this might</i>
be the craziest and hardest

543
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
and most stressful
challenge ever.

544
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,300
Time is getting shorter
and shorter and shorter.

545
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,533
&gt;&gt; Piece of shit.

546
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,934
&gt;&gt; Ow, son of a mother fucking
bitch!

547
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,133
It's do it or die.

548
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,400
[alarm clock buzzing]

549
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:13,266
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God, oh, my God,

550
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,266
oh, my God, oh, my God,

551
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,233
oh, my God, oh, my God.

552
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,667
&gt;&gt; Today, the clock is ticking,
honey.

553
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,233
Nobody's ready yet.

554
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,734
We are going crazy.

555
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,333
&gt;&gt; I'm nervous,
'cause I still have to do

556
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,066
my modern, worthy of
a red carpet look.

557
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,066
&gt;&gt; There's just so much
for everyone to do,

558
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:33,834
that everyone's really feeling
the pressure right now.

559
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,967
&gt;&gt; I'm stressed out of
my fucking mind.

560
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,700
I can feel the veins
in my temples

561
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,900
and in my neck just pulsating
with, like--

562
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,066
[inhales]
I just need to get it done.

563
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,500
&gt;&gt; Ready or not,
here comes mama.

564
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,200
&gt;&gt; Manila, you're getting ready
already?

565
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
What about your modern look?

566
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,600
&gt;&gt; Honey, I'm gonna
make it work.

567
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,133
It's gonna be a shake and go,
honey.

568
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,400
&gt;&gt; Did you finish everything?

569
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,500
&gt;&gt; Stop talking to me.

570
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,266
&gt;&gt; Ha ha!
Bitch.

571
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:58,066
&gt;&gt; I just wanna
get myself painted,

572
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,767
'cause if I'm in the bottom
and I have to lip-synch,

573
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,266
I at least want to be pretty
when I do it.

574
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,000
&gt;&gt; I don't feel like
I'm gonna be there.

575
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,133
I've worked really hard.

576
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,333
I'm confident
in what I'm bringing.

577
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,500
&gt;&gt; This has to be the most
difficult challenge so far.

578
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,667
But I'm actually finding
that I'm a lot better

579
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,567
at doing hair
than I thought I was.

580
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,500
&gt;&gt; I've always wanted to be
in drag,

581
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,600
even when I was a little boy.

582
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
I used to sneak into
my sister's closet

583
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,133
and take all of her clothes
and wear them around.

584
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,333
&gt;&gt; Drag made me be
who I want to be

585
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,633
whenever I wanted it to be.

586
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,533
It just gives me that freedom.

587
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,500
&gt;&gt; Freedom.

588
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,834
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a vacation.

589
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,300
You can take a vacation
every night.

590
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,333
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

591
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,266
And you get paid for it,

592
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,467
and it's even better.

593
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,000
To me, it's like
my artistic expression.

594
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,967
&gt;&gt; It's--I know,
it's your creation.

595
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,433
&gt;&gt; Everybody cannot do drag.

596
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,166
&gt;&gt; I think everybody
should have the right

597
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,734
to do drag if they want to,

598
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,734
even if they look busted.

599
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:49,767
I'm here.

600
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:50,767
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

601
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,834
When I started it,

602
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,266
like, I was kind of like,

603
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,133
"Am I an attractive person?"

604
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,133
&gt;&gt; I look pretty, and that's--

605
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,667
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

606
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,700
And that's it.

607
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,600
&gt;&gt; Some people use drag
as an escape.

608
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,967
Like they don't feel
that they--

609
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,533
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's true.

610
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,200
&gt;&gt; I agree.

611
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,533
'Cause I started so young.

612
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,066
I needed something to boost
my self-esteem, you know?

613
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,667
And people--people finally
told me I was beautiful.

614
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,500
The biggest difficulty for me,
though,

615
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,166
has been, like, people
who you know or knew people

616
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,667
don't know the real you.

617
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,200
They only know your character.

618
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,600
So they start only calling you
by your character name,

619
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,166
or, like, they only want to
see you in drag.

620
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,700
And then if you show up
and you're not in drag,

621
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,767
they're like,
"Oh, where's Shangela tonight?"

622
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:32,200
&gt;&gt; But for Alexis,
that's not a problem.

623
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,533
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

624
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,734
&gt;&gt; No, I don't--

625
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:35,834
I don't know if that's true,

626
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,166
because, I mean, RuPaul, like,

627
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,533
you know, half the time here--

628
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,700
&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about RuPaul;
I'm talking about me.

629
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,633
&gt;&gt; It all starts to become
one person after a while.

630
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:46,233
&gt;&gt; Raja's first picture of her
in drag is an oil painting.

631
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,333
[laughter]

632
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,066
&gt;&gt; No, bitch,
it's a cave painting.

633
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,433
&gt;&gt; No, it's one of
those pictures

634
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,533
where they have to have
the big flash that explodes

635
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,934
when you take the picture.

636
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,867
&gt;&gt; My problem with drag
is the dating scene.

637
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,500
&gt;&gt; It is kind of hard.

638
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,467
&gt;&gt; My situation that, every time
you're gonna date somebody,

639
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,433
you feel like you just--

640
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,500
&gt;&gt; Have to hide it.

641
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,166
&gt;&gt; You just have to come
out of the closet.

642
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,300
&gt;&gt; Yes.

643
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,734
And then when you're going out
for the night,

644
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,967
and you intend on going out
and hooking up with someone,

645
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,066
you have to make sure

646
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,066
that you put all your drag
up in the closet

647
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,934
and all the sequins
off the floor,

648
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,166
all the rhinestones.

649
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,734
&gt;&gt; It is true.

650
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,266
But that was at the beginning.

651
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,767
&gt;&gt; Now I don't care.
&gt;&gt; Ha!

652
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:31,200

Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

660

Hey, Michelle, we're going back

Now are you gonna be
splitting hairs

665
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200

I'm so glad you're here.

668
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
&gt;&gt; Hey, you.

669
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,567
I am so happy to be here.

670
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:02,600
And Fantasia.

671
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,900
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

672
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,333
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.

673
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,800
&gt;&gt; This week, our queens
were challenged

674
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,700
to compete in
a fantasy hair show

675
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,266
and create three
distinct hairstyles,

676
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:20,100
which includes a runway outfit
made entirely out of hair.

677
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Gentlemen...

678
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,734
start your engines.

679
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,500
And may the best woman win.

680
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,767
The first looks are their
classic hairstyles

681
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:33,433
from a past era-era-uh.

682
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,400
Yara Sofia.

683
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,467
Oh, she's got a disco feeling.

684
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,066
&gt;&gt; I'm bringing this '70s look.

685
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,533
With such an inspiration.

686
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,800
And I feel flawless.

687
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,367
&gt;&gt; She loves the nightlife.

688
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,767
&gt;&gt; Studio 54.

689
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,300
&gt;&gt; Alexis Mateo.

690
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,133
Bring the fur, baby.

691
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,066
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

692
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,633
&gt;&gt; My classic look
is all glamour.

693
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,667
Hollywood.

694
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,633
The golden age.

695
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:58,066
&gt;&gt; The drama.

696
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:00,300
&gt;&gt; Looks like she was outside
trapping some animals too.

697
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,400
&gt;&gt; A girl's gotta eat.

698
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,700
&gt;&gt; Look at Raja.

699
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Very '60s.
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

700
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,533
&gt;&gt; Yes, hey!
&gt;&gt; Twiggy!

701
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,066
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; That girl.

702
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,767
&gt;&gt; I just wanted her
to feel really sweet,

703
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,333
a little bit like
a sex-cretary in the '60s.

704
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,533
A little<i> Mad Men.</i>

705
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,200
&gt;&gt; Oh, I love a nude pump.

706
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,734
That's Raja from
the secretarial pool.

707
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:17,767
&gt;&gt; Sex in the '60s.

708
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,467
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

709
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,767
&gt;&gt; Shangela.

710
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,834
Uh-oh, I smell a costume change.

711
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,500
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

712
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,066
&gt;&gt; I'm a Spanish flamenco sister

713
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,633
all the way from Barcelona.

714
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,700
And I'm loving it.

715
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
&gt;&gt; Ooh,<i> el motivar.</i>

716
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,266
<i>Toro, toro!</i>

717
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,266
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

718
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,166
&gt;&gt; Ole.
&gt;&gt; Oh, and she popped the fan.

719
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,400
&gt;&gt; Yes, she popped that fan.

720
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,567
&gt;&gt; She popped something.

721
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,900
&gt;&gt; Manila.

722
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,066
&gt;&gt; She's giving you
Marie Antoinette meets<i> Shaft.</i>

723
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:43,066
&gt;&gt; Yes.

724
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,133
&gt;&gt; Blonde Venus.

725
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,367
&gt;&gt; Is she "rock me Amadeus"
from the '80s?

726
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,367
&gt;&gt; I have a powdered wig going.

727
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,300
I have my little, like,
curls on the side.

728
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,700
And I'm feeling fierce,
and the judges are living.

729
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,233
Oh, look at all the cameos.

730
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:57,066
&gt;&gt; And look at the candelabra
in her hair.

731
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,066
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

732
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,100
That's a candelabra.

733
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,700
This is their modern
red carpet look.

734
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,400
From Yara Sofia.

735
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Wow.

736
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,967
Desperate housewife.

737
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,400
&gt;&gt; There's a little J-Lo
in that one.

738
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,800
&gt;&gt; I'm giving the judges
a very strong haircut

739
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
like Rihanna, for example.

740
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,100
&gt;&gt; I'm going to the Emmys.

741
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,900
&gt;&gt; It's very Roberto Cavalli.

742
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
&gt;&gt; Sexy urban camo.

743
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,834
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

744
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,700
Alexis Mateo.

745
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,934
She's ready for the ALMA awards.

746
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,800
&gt;&gt; For my red carpet
modern look,

747
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,500
I make an evening mohawk.

748
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,600
And it's very modern,
it's very couture.

749
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
&gt;&gt; A little new school Mae West.

750
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,900
&gt;&gt; Yes, she is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.

751
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
She's trying life as a blonde.

752
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
&gt;&gt; Just a little bit at a time.

753
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

754
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,567
&gt;&gt; Raja.

755
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,700
Britt Ekland.

756
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,133
Ooh.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

757
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,300
&gt;&gt; Easy breezy.

758
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,433
&gt;&gt; I cut this hair.

759
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,266
This is something
that I razored on my own.

760
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,800
And I am ruling that runway.

761
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,834
All I can hear in my ears are

762
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,467
electric guitars and keyboards.

763
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,633
&gt;&gt; Vidal Sassoon.

764
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,633
Shangela.

765
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:56,233
Miss Diahann Carroll is
in the house.

766
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,233
&gt;&gt; Yes, she is.

767
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,433
&gt;&gt; I'm daytime class.

768
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,800
So I'm coming down the runway

769
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,200
giving you Diahann Carroll

770
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,900
at the Oprah's Legends ball.

771
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,200
And I'm feeling fierce.

772
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,266
&gt;&gt; Red carpet.

773
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,533
&gt;&gt; Oh, she gave you a wedge.

774
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

775
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,867
I think she's pumpin'
to bump it.

776
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,066
Manila.

777
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:12,333
&gt;&gt; Audrey Hepburn there.

778
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,066
&gt;&gt; Well, she's more
Jennifer Love Hewitt's version

779
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:16,100
of Audrey Hepburn.

780
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,066
&gt;&gt; Yes.

781
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:18,066
&gt;&gt; I'm walking down the runway,

782
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,133
and I feel like Audrey Hepburn

783
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,233
in<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>

784
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,834
or Barbara Streisand.

785
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,066
&gt;&gt; She has borrowed those jewels

786
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:25,066
from Harry Winston.

787
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,066
&gt;&gt; Of course.

788
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,734
&gt;&gt; The security guard
is backstage.

789
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:29,133
&gt;&gt; Waiting for me.

790
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:33,533
&gt;&gt; This is their fantasy hair
extravaganza.

791
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,734
Yara Sofia.

792
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:35,800
&gt;&gt; Oh!
&gt;&gt; Oh!

793
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,400
&gt;&gt; Take that, Bjork.

794
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,066
&gt;&gt; How much is that poodle
on the runway?

795
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:44,133
&gt;&gt; For the fantasy,
I'm wearing this hairy dress.

796
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:47,500
It's like a scorpion on the top.

797
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,533
I feel so fabulous.

798
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,367
&gt;&gt; I made a purse out
of Shirley Temple.

799
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,333
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

800
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,633
&gt;&gt; Won't get out of place.

801
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:56,633
&gt;&gt; I see her fantasy
is doggy style.

802
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,734
Alexis Mateo.

803
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:00,100
&gt;&gt; Oh!

804
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,133
&gt;&gt; Phantom of the drag queens.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

805
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,333
&gt;&gt; I look like a ballerina
in a circus.

806
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,467
I'm loving it.

807
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:07,800
It just screams Alexis Mateo
from far away.

808
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,166
&gt;&gt; Thighs wide open.

809
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,767
&gt;&gt; Yes, hunty.

810
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,066
Wild, wild west.

811
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,867
Miss Kitty never looked so good.

812
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,867
Raja.

813
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,233
Hair fantasy.

814
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:19,367
&gt;&gt; Wow.

815
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,066
&gt;&gt; I'm so happy with
what I've created.

816
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,467
It looks like this beautiful,

817
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:25,433
like, cotton candy
frothy milkshake.

818
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,667
&gt;&gt; Earth girls are easy!
&gt;&gt; Yes.

819
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,900
Yes, Rainbow Brite.

820
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,066
&gt;&gt; She's like a snow cone.

821
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,533
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh.

822
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:33,533
&gt;&gt; Shangela.

823
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,533
&gt;&gt; Ooh!
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

824
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,900
&gt;&gt; Mad Max.

825
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,767
&gt;&gt; Ooh, She-man the barbarian.

826
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:38,934
&gt;&gt; The minute I hit that runway,

827
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,266
I am alien warrior princess,

828
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:42,300
and I'm coming for you.

829
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,266
&gt;&gt; Two queens enter,
one queen leaves.

830
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,500
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

831
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
&gt;&gt; Beyond the merkin-dome.

832
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,066
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

833
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,233
I wanna see that in 3-D.

834
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,233
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

835
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,300
&gt;&gt; Manila.

836
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,600
&gt;&gt; What you buzzin' 'bout?

837
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
&gt;&gt; Yes, honey.

838
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,700
Honeybee.

839
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,066
&gt;&gt; I'm feeling cute
and floating around

840
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,600
on the runway, like,
from flower to flower.

841
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,567
&gt;&gt; She's pollinating the runway.

842
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:02,667
&gt;&gt; She is.

843
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,266
&gt;&gt; Buzz, buzz, buzz.

844
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,533
Welcome, ladies.

845
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:14,900
Your runway was absolutely
hair-raising.

846
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,200
And now it's time
for the judges' critique.

847
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,767
Let's start with Yara Sofia.

848
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,433
Tell me about
your fantasy extravaganza.

849
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:28,567
&gt;&gt; For me, the word
"extravaganza" means an animal.

850
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:32,467
&gt;&gt; The word "extravaganza"
to you means an animal,

851
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,433
like a scorpion and a poodle.

852
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:35,500
&gt;&gt; Scoodle.

853
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,533
&gt;&gt; I made this, um, scorpion,
um, curve.

854
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,567
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

855
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,533
&gt;&gt; And I feel very hairy.

856
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,700
Very hairy.

857
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

858
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,066
Well, girl, you are hairy.

859
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,066
&gt;&gt; [raspy groan]

860
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,433
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

861
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,300
&gt;&gt; It's very Dr. Seuss.

862
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,100
You're like a beautiful woman
from Whoville.

863
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,300
&gt;&gt; Don't take this the bad way,

864
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,200
but, like, you're like the ho
of Whoville.

865
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,300
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

866
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,533
&gt;&gt; A "who-ho."
&gt;&gt; A "who-ho."

867
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,533
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a "who-ho."

868
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,533
Horton heard a ho.

869
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,633
Who--I love that.

870
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:01,633
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

871
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:02,834
&gt;&gt; I love that.

872
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:06,233
&gt;&gt; Fantasia, what did you think
of her classic look?

873
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,467
&gt;&gt; Um, it reminds me so much of
my aunties.

874
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,133
How, you know,
how they used to do it.

875
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,266
And they used to rock it well.

876
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,300
And I want the outfit.

877
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

878
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,834
&gt;&gt; Do you think I can wear
that outfit?

879
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:15,900
&gt;&gt; Yes, I can make a few ones.

880
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,200
&gt;&gt; I got a lot of junk
in my trunk.

881
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
&gt;&gt; Don't worry, darling.

882
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

883
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,467
&gt;&gt; Next up, Alexis Mateo.

884
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,133
Hi, mami.
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.

885
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,500
Hi, judges.

886
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,066
&gt;&gt; Let's start with the best,

887
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,367
which is this look here.

888
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,500
Your fantasy look.

889
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,166
When you came out,
I totally got circus girl.

890
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:35,433
Your red carpet look that was
supposed to be very modern,

891
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:39,533
the hair was kind of like
budget RuPaul, in a way.

892
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,867
I mean, it was like, uh,

893
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,633
I don't know what award show
you would have worn that to.

894
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:44,834
&gt;&gt; What I don't understand is,

895
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,266
you do the modern red carpet,

896
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,633
and it looks like you're wearing
the red carpet.

897
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,367
You know, all along I've been
telling you,

898
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't understand why certain
things you wear

899
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,767
that makes your body look bigger
and malproportioned.

900
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:57,700
&gt;&gt; But I felt like a star
walking on that runway, so...

901
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,800
I would wear my dress with my
mohawk to my red carpet event.

902
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,734
And I would wear this
for the circus as well.

903
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:04,734
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

904
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:06,233
&gt;&gt; So bam!

905
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,233
[all laughing]

906
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,333
&gt;&gt; Up next, Raja.

907
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,867
Hi, Raja.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

908
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,166
&gt;&gt; What inspired your look?

909
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,000
&gt;&gt; The big mission I had
with this

910
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
is to make it
not look like hair.

911
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,467
&gt;&gt; I love the outfit.

912
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:20,734
You have beautiful legs.

913
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:21,934
&gt;&gt; They're wooden, by the way.

914
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:22,934
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

915
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,567
I'll take them, I'll take them.

916
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,767
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Fantasia.

917
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:28,734
Now all the way from
the Colombian coffee fields--

918
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:30,400
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

919
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,133
&gt;&gt; Let's go to Juan Valdez.

920
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:36,300
&gt;&gt; You look completely, like,
Japanime art.

921
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,000
And as for your red carpet look,

922
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,100
I liked your take on it.

923
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,400
It was definitely like
a young rocker.

924
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Love the hair.

925
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,533
The razor cut.

926
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:46,967
If I could have one critique,

927
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:49,967
it's that I think you look
even more beautiful

928
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,367
with less makeup on.

929
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,700
&gt;&gt; Your '60s look,

930
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,166
I put that you're like a sexy,
dark Goldie Hawn,

931
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,200
circa<i> Laugh-In.</i>

932
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
And you looked really natural
and real,

933
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,867
and that looked like that could
be you walking the streets.

934
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:02,867
&gt;&gt; Next up...

935
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,166
Shangela.

936
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,367
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.

937
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:06,867
&gt;&gt; Where'd you get
the inspiration

938
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,066
for your fantasy outfit?

939
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,700
&gt;&gt; You know,
I love sci-fi films.

940
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,967
I love horror,
scarier films.

941
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,633
&gt;&gt; Wait, what did you call me?

942
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:14,633
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

943
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,133
&gt;&gt; For the classic look,

944
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:19,133
I felt the dress
was a little too big.

945
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,200
I just would have loved to have

946
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,500
seen it be a little tighter,

947
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,433
'cause this figure that I'm
seeing right now...

948
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,734
[clicks tongue, imitates sizzle]

949
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:26,834
Hot.

950
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,834
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, just having one
solid look

951
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,066
works better than having kind of
like two mediocre looks,

952
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,200
because after you took
that big coat off,

953
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,734
you still had kind of
a big gunny sack of a dress on

954
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:39,734
underneath it.

955
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,667
Your modern red carpet look,

956
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,400
it looked more kind of like the
high-class executive secretary.

957
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,367
It just wasn't quite there
to a red carpet event.

958
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,800
&gt;&gt; I felt like I was going to,

959
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,333
like, Oprah's Legends ball.

960
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,333
&gt;&gt; Montecito.

961
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,333
&gt;&gt; That's right.

962
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,667
It was a daytime look.

963
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,667
&gt;&gt; Why would you pick a daytime
red carpet?

964
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,734
&gt;&gt; I'm an E! fan.

965
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:58,900
They have carpets all day long.

966
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could wear that on
the red carpet.

967
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,300
Would E! stop you

968
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,633
to talk to you and ask you,

969
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,934
"Who did your hair?"

970
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,900
No, they'd probably go,
"Eh, she did her hair."

971
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,233
But you appear to be
very fearless

972
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,500
just like your dressed--

973
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,900
you know, when I was a kid,
I was a big fan of D&amp;D,

974
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,266
and you look like a D&amp;D heroine.

975
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,467
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens?

976
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:20,667
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens.

977
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,834
&gt;&gt; Next up, Manila.

978
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,066
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.

979
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:25,233
Hi, judges-zzzzzz.

980
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,867
&gt;&gt; Hi, Manila.

981
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,233
&gt;&gt; I loved the classic.

982
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,633
I want the dress.

983
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:31,700
I want the boots.

984
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,900
I loved everything about
the classic look.

985
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,767
&gt;&gt; Who wears a tiara
to a red carpet?

986
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,800
&gt;&gt; I would.

987
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,967
&gt;&gt; Hey, girl.
&gt;&gt; Hey!

988
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:41,934
&gt;&gt; We queens, Santino.

989
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,266
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Get into it.

990
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,767
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

991
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,166
I really just felt that, uh,

992
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,633
enormous central necklace

993
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,967
made your beautiful neck

994
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:54,600
and this whole area just
kind of look a little mannish.

995
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,567
&gt;&gt; Okay.

996
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,066
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Pancho Villa.

997
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,400
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

998
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,467
&gt;&gt; So, Manila, I can just
eat you

999
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:01,600
with a spoon tonight.

1000
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,500
And what I love most about you
as a drag queen

1001
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,166
is your ability
to theme couture.

1002
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,300
Like, you always have these
great themes.

1003
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,867
&gt;&gt; A love of fashion
and insects,

1004
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,066
you don't find that
in a woman.

1005
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,333
&gt;&gt; No, you don't.
&gt;&gt; Good job.

1006
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,300
&gt;&gt; Thank you, ladies.

1007
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,467
I think we've heard enough.

1008
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:19,133
While you go and untuck

1009
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,367
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

1010
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,100
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1011
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,667
You may leave the stage.

1012
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,166
[car engine starting up]

1013
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,200
Okay, kids.

1014
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,433
We're gonna start with
Yara Sofia.

1015
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,400
She was our scorpion poodle.

1016
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,533
&gt;&gt; Scoodle.

1017
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,367
&gt;&gt; She really brought it
to the fantasy level.

1018
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,333
&gt;&gt; I thought she tore it up.

1019
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,133
The '70s look was
out of control.

1020
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,467
The hair was gorgeous.

1021
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:41,767
I loved the big gold hoops.

1022
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,300
I want that outfit.

1023
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,066
&gt;&gt; Is it wrong that I think

1024
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:48,333
that the booty is so amazing?

1025
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,867
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; It's juicy, honey.

1026
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:50,934
&gt;&gt; Yes.

1027
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, this kinda
messes with

1028
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
your perception of things.

1029
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,667
&gt;&gt; It does.
&gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness.

1030
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:55,800
&gt;&gt; It wrecks your head, honey.

1031
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,567
&gt;&gt; Now you see what happened to
Eddie Murphy.

1032
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:58,633
&gt;&gt; [laughing]
&gt;&gt; What?

1033
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,233
&gt;&gt; Alexis Mateo.

1034
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,700
&gt;&gt; She looked like she was
coming from

1035
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,667
a Bell Biv Devoe video.

1036
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,633
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

1037
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:04,800
She didn't look like--

1038
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
she didn't look like
a Hollywood starlet.

1039
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,567
&gt;&gt; That '40s look, there was
nothing '40s about it.

1040
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,567
Maybe $40.

1041
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:11,567
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

1042
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,567
&gt;&gt; And that's about it.

1043
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,834
&gt;&gt; All right.

1044
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:17,667
Do think that her red carpet
look was too regional?

1045
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,333
&gt;&gt; She wore the red carpet
and spangled it.

1046
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,166
&gt;&gt; Miss Raja.

1047
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,867
&gt;&gt;<i> ♪ Raja, raja, raja ♪</i>

1048
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:24,834
all: [laughing]

1049
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:25,900
&gt;&gt; I love her.

1050
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,700
When she walked out,
it was that look of,

1051
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,133
"Even if you don't like it,

1052
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,166
"the way I'm about to walk out
here with it,

1053
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,200
you're gonna like it."

1054
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,300
&gt;&gt; Sell the garment.

1055
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,367
&gt;&gt; I would say, although
she really worked it

1056
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,633
and gave us that rock and roll
kind of

1057
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:42,467
first time at the Grammys
kind of young rocker look,

1058
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,633
I do wish maybe
she would have brought it

1059
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,200
in a more conventional way,

1060
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,066
because I would love to see
what Raja

1061
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,667
would wear to the Oscars.

1062
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,867
&gt;&gt; It's probably more realistic

1063
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,900
to think that she would
do something

1064
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,700
that looks like
a red carpet gown,

1065
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,867
instead of going Miley Cyrus.

1066
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:58,867
&gt;&gt; Shangela.

1067
00:34:58,867 --> 00:34:59,800
&gt;&gt; You know what?

1068
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,233
She reminds me
so much of myself,

1069
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,767
just with being the underdog.

1070
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,400
With going into something
and saying,

1071
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
"You know what?

1072
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
"I might not have this,

1073
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,333
"I might not have that,

1074
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,600
but I'm gonna give it my all."

1075
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,100
&gt;&gt; All of those things
that you said,

1076
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,700
Fantasia, I love about her.

1077
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,433
And that's really why
she's still here.

1078
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,633
&gt;&gt; Yes.

1079
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,734
&gt;&gt; Because as far as her
fashion sense, her style...

1080
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:18,166
she is clueless.

1081
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,066
&gt;&gt; Is anybody else seeing

1082
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,266
the five o'clock shadow
consistently?

1083
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:23,633
&gt;&gt; It's not
a five o'clock shadow,

1084
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,100
it's actually
the shade of makeup,

1085
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,166
and it's her highlighting.

1086
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,567
&gt;&gt; So it's picking up where--

1087
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,700
&gt;&gt; She's not blending it
very well; that's what it is.

1088
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,433
&gt;&gt; I do think that Shangela has
an amazing spirit

1089
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:35,900
and I think may be pursuing
the wrong thing,

1090
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,533
because there are clearly
other people

1091
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,800
who eat, breathe, sleep this,

1092
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,133
and it comes out of their pores.

1093
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,233
&gt;&gt; Manila.

1094
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,633
&gt;&gt; Wasn't a big fan
of the fantasy.

1095
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,500
Love, love, love the classic.

1096
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,467
She had an afro and she had some
curls on the side.

1097
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:52,166
I'm thinking, "Who does that?

1098
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,533
And who pulls it off
like she did?"

1099
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:57,066
&gt;&gt; As for her red carpet look,

1100
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,533
I think she just kind of

1101
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,934
overworked the jewelry.

1102
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:02,066
&gt;&gt; I don't know, she did it
for me tonight.

1103
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,467
&gt;&gt; All right.

1104
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,367
Silence!

1105
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,767
I've made my decision.

1106
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,700
Bring back...

1107
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,233
my girls.

1108
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,200
Ladies.

1109
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,633
Based on your performance

1110
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,066
and your presentation
on the main stage,

1111
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:21,467
I've made some decisions.

1112
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,533
Raja.

1113
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,367
You served three hot looks.

1114
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:33,367
And your cotton candy fantasy is
truly delicious.

1115
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,834
You're safe.

1116
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:37,800
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

1117
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,233
&gt;&gt; Yara Sofia.

1118
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:44,667
This week, you scoodled
your way to victory.

1119
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,667
Condragulations.

1120
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,667
You are the winner
of this challenge.

&gt;&gt; [cursing in Spanish]

1122
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,100
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

1123
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,367
&gt;&gt; And you've won an Alaskan
cruise for two

1124
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,867
from America's number one
gay travel specialist,

1125

1126
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,667
&gt;&gt; Do you know what, darling?

1127
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,066
It's about time.

1128
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:10,667
It is so good to finally
win a challenge.

1129
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,066
&gt;&gt; Alexis Mateo.

1130
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,100
You are a timeless queen.

1131
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,300
But some of your hairstyles were
a little dated

1132
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,367
and off the mark.

1133
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:23,734
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1134
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:25,166
&gt;&gt; I don't wanna go home.

1135
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,633
I wanna stay in this competition
all the way till the end.

1136
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:29,500
&gt;&gt; Manila.

1137
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,133
You rocked
three very different looks.

1138
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:37,333
And your fantasy bee was killer.

1139
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:40,834
You're safe, honey.

1140
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,300
Shangela.

1141
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,667
You are a sharp queen.

1142
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,500
But I'm afraid your hairstyles

1143
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,700
didn't make the cut.

1144
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,100
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1145
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
&gt;&gt; Wow, I'm back here...again.

1146
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,967
And, you know, it's really tough

1147
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:01,300
having to lip-synch against
a friend in this competition.

1148
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,967
&gt;&gt; Two queens stand before me.

1149
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:05,667
Ladies, this is your last chance

1150
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,233
to impress me
and save yourselves...

1151
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:14,066
from elimination.

1152
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:19,166
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.

1153
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,066
Good luck.

1154
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,200
And don't...

1155
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,433

&gt;&gt; Shangela.

1205
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:47,000
No one can say you didn't
try your hardest.

1206
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,033
And it's that drive
that will take you far.

1207
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,867
Live your dreams, mama.

1208
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,066

&gt;&gt; Halleloo!

1213
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,567
It's a sad feeling because
I definitely came back

1214
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,567
into this competition
wanting to win.

1215
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:08,967
And it's not been easy.

1216
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,367
But I'm leaving a winner.

1217
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,467
And it's just a lesson
for everyone

1218

who's ever wanted to pursue
any dream they've had.

1219

Live your passion.

1220
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,867
And live it to the fullest.

Halleloo!

1222

&gt;&gt; Well, ladies.

1223
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:28,066
As you know, each week
I consult with the judges,

1224
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:31,834
but the final decision
is mine to make.

1225
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:36,100
It seems that I've been
criticized

1226
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,467
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.

1227
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,367
Michelle.

1228
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,533

1229
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:49,567
&gt;&gt; I want you to confer
with Santino and Billy B.

1230
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:55,900
to decide which of
the eliminated queens...

1231
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,400
deserve to return
to this competition...

1232
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,834

1233

&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.

1234
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,100
Are you freaking kidding me?

1235
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,166
&gt;&gt; And you may pick from
any of the queens

1236
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:16,200

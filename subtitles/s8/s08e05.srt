I completely shut down.

-And I have to change that.

a bitch. I'm sorry.

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,667
Yeah,
it was you being a bitch.

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,667
Well, this is my second week
in the bottom three.

34
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,066
I am so happy to still be here.

35
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,433
I was in shock
that it was not you lip-syncing.

36
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,934
It was Naysha.

37
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,233
[Derrick] But Chris and Debbie
thought I stood out.

38
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,633
Chris was like, "I think
you could impersonate Debbie.

39
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,300
And we'll take you out on tour."

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,867
They may have been on drugs.
I want a drug test.

41
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,467
Yeah,
I didn't hear you get that.

42
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,100
-But--
-I did get told

43
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,433
that my performance
was phenomenal.

44
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,633
Which you didn't get told.

45
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,066
All right.

46
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,233
Derrick, I think
you just missed the point,

47
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,900
-but it's not a big deal.
-Okay.

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Well, I don't know
if there was a point.

49
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,133
It's just Bob talking
is your point all the time.

50
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,967
But you'll do, like,
side shady comments,

51
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,266
and it's funny,
but when I do side shady

52
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,567
-comments, it's like, over.
-No. No, but what you--

53
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,333
Anyone else see this?
Am I on Lonely Island?

54
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,066

55
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,066
-You're right.
-Thank you.

00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,100
-[laughs]
-I don't see that I do that.

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,233
I can't wait
till you do it again.

58
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,800
It'll be, like, five minutes.

59
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,533

"I ain't never

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,467
make jokes about anyone ever."

64
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,233
Hey, Bob.

65
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,433
If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,

66
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,567
can you give me any tips?

67
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,233
Ooh hoo hoo!

68
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,066

memorable drag next week,

00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,934
-I can give you some tips.
-[laughs]

70
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,967
So all I need to do
is not wear a wig

71
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,367
and I'll be told by
the judges that I'm pretty.

72
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,633
-Babe.
-Didn't I remind you guys?

73
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,066
I said, "In about five minutes,

74
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,667
she'd make a shady comment
out of nowhere"?

75
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,467
And I did.

76
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,867
What I said wasn't meant
to hurt your feelings.

77
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:42,967
You're trying to be spiteful.
You see the difference?

78
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,200
Your intentions
weren't to hurt me?

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,066
No, they weren't to hurt.
If I wanted to hurt you,

80
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,633
you'd be cryin'
right now, bitch.

81
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,400
I will never cry
over you at all.

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,567
Don't give me a challenge.

83
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,533
I work on the strip with
really big drag personalities.

84
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,367

you're gonna come for me,

Which is brilliant by the way.

156

-Yeah, I think it's funny.
-Because she's so, so funny.

-Oh, she's the craziest.

I'm impersonating
Nancy Grace, herself,

161
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,333
because she seems
like a major bitch,

162
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,867

what are you thinkin' about?

164
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,166
-I'm doing Diana Vreeland.
-Who?

165
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,500

editor in chief

-of "Vogue" in the '60s.
-Oh.

167
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,367
Do you think
that's a hair obscure?

168
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,567
No.
Not at all.

are you doing?

to do Whoopi Goldberg.

176
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,433
"The Color Purple" is, like,
one of my favorite movies.

177
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,533
And it's so quotable.

178
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,967
Everyone knows
"The Color Purple."

179
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,166
-Yeah.
-I've been working on it

180
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,367
since I found out I was gonna
be on the show.

181
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:23,600
And I cannot wait to be able
to prove that I am a performer.

182
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,300
I'm not just a runway queen.

183
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,500
Who are you doing?

184
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,533
I'm torn
between Whoopi Goldberg,

185
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,300
Uzo Aduba,

186
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,934
who is an actress on, um,

187
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,500
-"Orange Is The New Black"...
-Oh, yeah.

188
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,567
And my last choice
is probably my favorite,

189
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,266
but I look the least like her,
is Carol Channing.

190
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,133
Why would you do--well.

191
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,633
<i>I know some folks</i>
<i>are gonna question</i>

192
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,900
why is a 6'2" black man

193
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,266
doing Carol Channing, but it's

194
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,600
because I feel a connection
with Carol Channing.

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,500
-I really do.
-See, isn't this not--

196
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,967
-Miss Celie?
-[laughs]

197
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,433
You really do look like
Miss Celie.

198
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,467
I sure is ugly.

199
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,233
I want to show you how much
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.

200
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,166
So Bob basically has,
like, ten characters

201
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,300
that he could possibly do.

202
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,333
All the sudden, he's got
the "Sister Act" outfit on.

203
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,667
He is, like, really giving
that Whoopi look.

204
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,133
I think that if you hit a man,

205
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,233
a man has the right
to knock you out.

206
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,266
You don't want
to get hit by a man,

207
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,100
don't go around hittin' people.
That's all I'm sayin'.

208
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,633
This is gonna
be the Whoopi Game

209
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,066
instead of the Snatch Game.

210
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm realizing,
"Oh, shit.

211
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,967
I might be out
of my league here."

212
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:23,367
So I'm gonna have to go
with my plan B backup.

213
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:26,133
Bob is so excited
for Snatch Game,

214
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,200
that he's changed
his character, like, 90 times.

215
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I think these
are the moves

216
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,567
you got to do
to be Uzo Aduba.

217
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,233
But the brightest bulbs

218
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:38,433
have a way of dimming suddenly
or just going out.

219
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,967
Today's challenge--
Ding! Ding! Ding!

220
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,600
Is gonna be Snatch Game.

221
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,066
<i>It's a celebrity impersonation,</i>

222
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,200
<i>so you have</i>
<i>to make people laugh.</i>

223
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,533
So I'm gonna be busier
than a one-legged cat

224
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,500
in a sandbox tryin'
to win this challenge.

225
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,567
Hey, celebrities.

226
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,066
[all] Hey!

227
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,367
Are you ready
to snatch my attention?

228
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,500
[all cheer]

229
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,567
-Hi, Chi Chi.
-Mama Ru.

230
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,433
[laughs]
Who are you doing?

231
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,266
-I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.
-Uh-huh.

232
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,400
How are you gonna make
Eartha funny?

233
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,567
Um, I know
that she played Catwoman

234
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:18,367
and I have two cats at home.
I'm just gonna play off--

235
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,967
Well, that--there it is!

236
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,467
You've got two cats at home.

237
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,667
To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,

238
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,066
and you've got to make me laugh.

239
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,867
-Yeah.
-All right. See you out there.

240
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,433
-All right.
-Thank you.

241
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,533
Hi, Kim Chi.

242
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,300
Have you decided on what
character you're gonna portray?

243
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,467
Um, there's two characters
I'm debating between.

244
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:41,600
First one is...Pearl.

245
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,066
Is there something on my face?

246
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:51,066
[laughs]

247
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,367
I started doing drag
with Pearl,

248
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,867
<i>who was on season 7,</i>

249
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,433
<i>so I know her quirks</i>
<i>really well.</i>

250
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,066
Right. Right.
And who's your other character?

251
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,734
The other one
is kind of obscure.

252
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,767
-Uh-huh.
-Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.

253
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,066
-Kimmy?
-Kimmy, yeah.

254
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,367
Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,

255
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,066
but if I turn
the North Korean dictator

256
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,367
into a drag version of him,
it would be a chance

257
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,367
<i>for me to show</i>
<i>another side of Kim Chi</i>

258
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,200
that's a little fucked up.

259
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,667
Huh.
That's interesting.

260
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,967
Listen, whatever works for you.

261
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,500
Just so long as
you make me laugh.

262
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,066
Kimmy Jong-what?

263
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,900
<i>A made-up character,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

264
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,100
I really hope that
lands her in the bottom.

265
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,967
<i>-♪ Hey, Derrick ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Hey, Ru ♪</i>

266
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,266
Are you gonna do Brittney?

267
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,166
It's an obvious choice.

268
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,467
But this is my chance
to show everyone

269
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,100
that I'm more than

270
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,567
-just a Brittney impersonator.
-Uh-huh.

271
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,433
And so
I think I'm gonna go

272
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,467
with Laura Bell Bundy's
character.

273
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,500
Yes,
she's the country singer

274
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,967
-Broadway star.
-Right.

275
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,367
And she made up

276
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,100
all these characters,
and Shocantelle

277
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,066
-is my favorite one.
-Uh-huh.

278
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,333
She is a black girl
trapped in a white girl's body.

279
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,533
Ah.

280
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,066
Can I see a little bit

281
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,200
of your Laura Bell Bundy
character?

282
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,333
Hello, RuPaul.
I am here.

283
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,500
My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.

284
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,500
You know, sometimes
the most obvious thing

285
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
is the thing to do.

286
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,233
You just have to decide
where you want to go.

287
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,066
Stakes are high.
There's $100,000 on the line.

288
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,166
Yeah, that's true.

289
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,500
-All right, Derrick.
-Thank you, Ru.

290
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,100
-Bye.
-Bye.

291
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,233
Oh, Lord.

292
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,934
-Thorgy Thor.
-That's me.

293
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,400
Wait a minute, let me see.
I'm getting, uh,

294
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,567
-Charles Manson.
-No.

295
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,400
-No?
-Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.

296
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
How are you gonna make
Michael Jackson funny?

297
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,467
His little quirks.
His little movements

298
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,967
that I have down.

299
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah.

300
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,967
Who's your biggest
competition here?

301
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,266
You know, I'm gonna say Bob.

302
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,567
You know, what you're asking us
to do in this season,

303
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,567
Bob is really excelling at,
which is pissing me off.

304
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,433
Well, let me tell you this,
Thorgy.

305
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,500
And this might help you.

306
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,467
You second-guess
and you take it into your head.

307
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,233
-Constantly.
-This is an opportunity

308
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,800
for you to feel confident
going with your gut

309
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,567
and not overthinking things.

310
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,200
-Yeah.
-All right, Thorgy.

311
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,100
-I'll see you out there.
-Okay.

312
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,967
All right, ladies.
Gather round.

313
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:12,633
Tomorrow on the runway,

00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,567
Nancy Grace is here.

348
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,100
-Hello, Nancy.
-You know,

349
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,266
I'm worried about
the children, RuPaul.

350
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:41,066
There's reefer smokers
influencing them every day.

351
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,133
All right.
All right.

352
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,400
Up next, legendary "Vogue"
fashion editor,

353
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
Diana Vreeland.

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,066
RuPaul!

355
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,600
What's in this season, Diana?

356
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,166
How the hell should I know?

357
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,633
Up next, reality superstar,

358
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,166
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

359
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,266
New York is in
the mutha-fuckin' house.

360
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:03,834
[laughs]

361
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,367
Up next,
Eartha Kitt is here.

362
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,934
How are you?

363
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,300
You're not wearing
any panties, are you?

364
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,533
Who wears panties?

365
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,133
What are those?

366
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400
All right, up next,
Britney Jean Spears is here.

367
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,433
I don't wear panties either.

368
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,066
You don't
wear panties either?

369
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,967
Especially when I get
out of cars.

370
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,333
[laughter]

371
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,166
All right.
From "Orange Is The New Black",

372
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,433
Uzo Aduba is here.

373
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,166
Don't say anything stupid.
Don't say anything stupid.

374
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,867
Uh, how you doin', RuPaul?

375
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,266
Are you ready
to play the game?

376
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm excited.

377
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,533
I don't know
why you all gaggin'.

378
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,200
She bring it to you
every season.

379
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,700
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.

380
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,467
Welcome back to Snatch Game.

381
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,133
Here's how the game works.

382
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:51,567
I ask a question,
and you give an answer

383
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,300
that you think will match
our supermodel contestants.

384
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,433
[giggles]

385
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,667
First question.
Gigi Hadid.

386
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,533
There's a new dating app
for drag queens.

387
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,066
When you join,

388
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:07,433
the first question they ask
is, "How big is your blank?"

389
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,200
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.

390
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,066
How big is your wig?

391
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,600
I love that!

392
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,667
Let's go to our superstars

393
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,266
and find out
if you got any matches.

394
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,467
Okay.

395
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,233
Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un

396
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,600
from North Korea.

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,266
The first question
they ask is, "How big is your"?

398
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,667
I wrote down
weapons of ass destruction.

399
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,834
Weapons of ass destruction.

400
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:33,467
Not a match.
[laughing] I--yeah.

401
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:37,266
Well, thank you,
the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un.

402
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,400
Ms. Eartha Kitt.

403
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,266
Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...

404
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,066
[laughter]

405
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:47,066
But I said,
"Big furry balls."

406
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,166
How big is your big
furry balls?

407
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,066
Honey, get your mind
out of the gutter.

408
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:52,934
Of course.

409
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,567
-[laughing]
-[purring]

410
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,066
Prosecutor Nancy Grace.

411
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,266
Well, as everybody knows,
not only do I do newscasting,

412
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,066
but I also was on another show
where I danced.

413
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,333
So I said, "How big
are your bunions?"

414
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,333
What do you do for bunions?

415
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,266
Well, I was told
you can get 'em shaved off.

416
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:12,533
That's what they do.
I'm about to get that done.

417
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,533
All right.
Sorry, Gigi.

418
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,133
Not a match.

419
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:18,367
Let's move on to
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

420
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,533
How big is your clock?

421
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,934
Because drag queens
love a big-ass clock, right?

422
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:26,233
[feeble laughter]

423
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,900
Ru seems to be throwing Naomi
every bone she can find.

424
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,200
Do you like a big clock,
yourself?

425
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,100
But this dog won't catch.

426
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,066
Chanel Iman.
It's your turn now, darling.

427
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,333
The big bad wolf
is a drag queen.

428
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,266
Instead of huffing,
and puffing,

429
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,900
and blowing,

430
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,433
she blanks the house down.

431
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:48,333
Shakes?

432
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,667
She gonna shake
the house down.

433
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,567
Shake that ass.

434
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:52,934
Mm.

435
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,200
All right, well,
let's go to our celebrities

436
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,066
and find out
if you've got a match.

437
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,567
Let's start
with Latoya's brother,

438
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,500
Michael Jackson.

439
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,066
I just said,
"Takes a long nap

440
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,533
in a bed
with everyone they know."

441
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,567
-Michael, that's crazy.
-Thank you.

442
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,166
[laughter]

443
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,300
Mm-hmm.

444
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,433
Let's move on
down to Diana Vreeland.

445
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,900
I used to work
for "Vogue" magazine.

446
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,166
But I heard that now
"Vogue" means a dance.

447
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,667
So I think they vogue
the house down.

448
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,934
Girl.
This performance is poo.

449
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:26,166
And you're from the same town
as Jinkx and Dela?

450
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,133
Ooh, girl.
Them girls is gonna--

451
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,600
I was about to say
they gonna hang you,

452
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,500
but I ain't gonna say that.

453
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,333
[laughs]

454
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,200
Eartha Kitt.

455
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,633
Instead of huffing, puffing
and blowing,

456
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,533
she blanks the house down.

457
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,066
She licks the house.

458
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,600
Ooh.
Licks the house down.

459
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,567
And speaking of lick,
it's time for my bath.

460
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,100
What?
Oh, you--

461
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,433
[laughs]

462
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,633
[giggles]

463
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,500
[laughter]

464
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,467
Ha, ha.
That's what cats do.

465
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

466
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,266
Eartha Kitt
didn't do that, Chi Chi.

467
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,433
Let's move on down
to Britney Jean.

468
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,333
She reads the house down.

469
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,400
That's not a match,
unfortunately, Chanel Iman.

470
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,367
But has Eartha Kitt
got your tongue?

471
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,900
I've had that tongue before.

472
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,233
-You have?
-Good girls gone bad.

473
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,567
Yeah.

474
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,400
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,667
You should do
that one more time.

476
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,066
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,367
I would be very
popular in prison.

478
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,433
[laughter]

479
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,367
All right.
Crazy Eyes.

480
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,133
[laughs]

481
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,834
Because you pretty,
I just wrote a poem...

482
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,500
-Yeah.
-To Iman.

483
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,066
A-Once a queen named Iman

484
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,400
remind me of the Sun.

485
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,567
Instead of her
supermodel life,

486
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,066
She can be...

487
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,166
my wife.

488
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,367
[laughter]

489
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:50,233
Unfortunately, Chanel,
that is not a match.

490
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,100
Next question.

491
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,066
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.

492
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:57,066
Lady Bunny has an unusual way
of celebrating gay pride.

493
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,900
Instead of the rainbow flag,

494
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,533
she hangs her blank
out the window.

495
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,200
Her tucking panties.

496
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,367
Let's go to the king
of pop and hear

497
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:08,967
if you have a match.

498
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,200
Oh, Ru.
It's not a match,

499
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,834
but I said, "She waves
her blanket."

500
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,200
-Say "Hi."
-Oh, hi, Blanket.

501
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,300
-Hi, Blanket.
-Hi, hi. Bye-bye.

502
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,066
Oh, please be careful.
You don't want Blanket to fall.

503
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:18,967
-No.
-Oh, thank you.

504
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:19,867
Yes.

505
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,133
[scatting]

506
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,967
Moving on down
to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

507
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:29,166
When I think of Pride,
I think of...my hair.

508
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,467
So I said $800 weave?

509
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,166
That's an $800 weave?

510
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,500
Well, of course.
Blended.

511
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,233
Yes.
Yes.

512
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,734
<i>Naomi's "New York"?</i>

513
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,133
I'm sorry, Gigi.

514
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,066
You didn't get
a match this time.

515
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,066
Maybe next time.

516
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:49,066
Well, look who's here.

517
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,266
I'm sorry
that I'm late.

518
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:55,066
But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo
left the stage

519
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,333
and she asked me
if I would fill in.

520
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,333
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Carol Channing.

521
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,633
Oh, thank you.

522
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,934
[laughter]

523
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,533
All right.
Chanel Iman.

524
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,266
Sally the Supermodel

525
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:09,266
is so lactose intolerant,

526
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:13,166
when the photographer
says, "cheese," she blanks.

527
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,400
-Sneezes.
-She sneezes!

528
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,300
Let's go down to Nancy Grace.

529
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,233
She sends out an Amber Alert.

530
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,467
Nancy Grace is terrible.

531
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,133
It's important
to keep the children

532
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,333
safe from the boozers

533
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,967
and the users
and the reefer smokers.

534
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,367
<i>It's lifeless.</i>

535
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:36,066
It's basically Acid Betty
turned into Boring Betty.

536
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,066
Let's move on down
to Britney Spears,

537
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,400
the princess of pop.

538
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,533
She, "Oops.

539
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:41,433
I did it again."

540
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,066
-Ahh.
-[giggles]

541
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,467
Do you mean
between me down there?

542
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,066
She had diarrhea.

543
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:49,133
[laughter]

544
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,567
All right,
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.

545
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,100
I've worked with Sally
for so long.

546
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,133
She pops a pill, RuPaul.

547
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:56,867
She pops a pill.

548
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,066
There is so much talk
about drugs.

549
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,567
I have-haven't taken
anything but Lipitor

550
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,467
for the past ten years.

551
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,567
You don't really
get a buzz off of that.

552
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,500
Now, is there an anal option?

553
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,300
I might happen to have a Fleet
or two in my home.

554
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,834
A Fleet enema.

555
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,166
Now you're talkin'
my language.

556
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,166
If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.

557
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,066
By the way, Eartha,

558
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,400
I didn't know
that was you down there.

559
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
-It's me, darling.
-From here,

560
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,533
I couldn't tell if you were
Della Reese or Luther Vandross.

561
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,100
I couldn't see.

562
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,934
These aren't even
my good glasses.

563
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,934
But back to
the matter at hand.

564
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,400
I just wrote "corn".

565
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
-That's always a good answer.
-You know, there's no dairy.

566
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
And it comes out the way
you put it in, RuPaul.

567
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,934
Well, listen.
On that note, I am sorry, folks,

568
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,133
but we are well out of time.

569
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,934
It was a really
close game,

570
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,367
but the winner is...

571
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,233
[drum roll]

572
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,433
Charo!

573
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,567
<i>[record scratches]</i>

574
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,133

Mwah!

582
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,433
What?
I can't believe she--

583
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,533
[laughter]

584
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,300
Always the first.

585
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,467
<i>It's elimination day,</i>

586
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,233
and it is the
Night of the 100 Madonnas.

587
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,433
And as I'm pulling out
my kimono,

588
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,500
I see Thorgy's also
pulling out a red kimono.

589
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,633
Great minds think alike?

590
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,367
In New York, it's funny.
It's like we're always put

591
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:31,200
in these boxes of, like,
what people's expectations

592
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,367
of who we are as, you know,

593
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,867
-drag artists?
-Yes.

594
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,600
Now, even people
are putting Brooklyn in a box.

595
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,533
Brooklyn doesn't accept me.

596
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,233
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of queens at home</i>

597
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,867
<i>who do not interact with me.</i>

598
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,533
It sucks that none of them
ask me to be a part

599
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,600
of their community.

600
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,166
So I don't fit in anywhere.

601
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,266
There are certain definitions
of "drag."

602
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,100
You know, and there's,

603
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
like, "I'm put in it 'cause
I'm the 'look queen.'"

604
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,200
I've had fights
with those people

605
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,066
where they're like, "Oh,
you're not a drag queen.

606
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,266
-You just do looks."
-Yes. Mm-hmm.

607
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:03,066
<i>It hurts me, actually,</i>
<i>that I'm a lone soldier.</i>

608
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,100
And I think
that's that huge wall

609
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,367
that I put in between me
and myself and everybody else.

610
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,233
I think this show's
a great platform, though,

611
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,333
because it kind of shows

612
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,066
that we do something more
than just stand around

613
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,667
-and serve booze.
-Yup.

614
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,633
You know, or sit around
and be a bitch.

615
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,867
Yeah.

616
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,133
You know,
I do all these shows.

617
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,600
I make all these things.
But I'm also a musician.

618
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
What I really want to do is,
like, do a grand,

619
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,533
like, event,
like, "Thorgy

620
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,467
-and the Thorchestra."
-Fabulous.

621
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:27,633
Like, a 40-piece orchestra,

622
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,233
and I want to conduct in drag.

623
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,800
<i>I am a professional violinist,</i>
<i>violist, cellist.</i>

624
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,367
<i>You know, I've played</i>
<i>at Carnegie Hall many times.</i>

625
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,066
<i>I feel like I'm</i>
<i>the perfect medium</i>

626
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,934
<i>to kind of appeal to, like,</i>
<i>the younger generation</i>

627
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:40,233
and make Classical music cool.

628
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,166
It's a throwback to, like,
events where, like,

629
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,266
you dressed up just to get
on the red carpet.

630
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:45,734
I love that.

631
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,934
Do you have any siblings, Bob?

632
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,433
I have two brothers, actually.

633
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:51,133
-Uh-huh.
-How many do you have?

634
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,533
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.

635
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,467
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.

636
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,266
-You said you were adopted?
-Yeah.

637
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,400
Did they have a talk where
they were, like, "You know--"

638
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,867
Where they went, like, one day,
like, "Well, just so you know."

639
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,133
Well,
it's--like it's very obvious

640
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,066
that I'm adopted.
These are my parents.

641
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,467
So growing up
with white parents.

642
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,834
A rainbow family.

643
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,867
Like, this is my mom.
She's gorgeous.

644
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,467
Yeah, she's, like,
the best mom ever.

645
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,066
I'm literally the only gay one
in my family.

646
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,667
<i>And I have</i>
<i>a Christian background,</i>

647
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,400
<i>and I've heard stories of kids</i>

648
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,266
<i>being shunned from the family</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

649
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:23,400
<i>And my mom has done nothing</i>
<i>but make me feel accepted.</i>

650
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,433
And, she's just
an amazing woman.

651
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,200
I love my mom.

652
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,266
Growing up, I literally had,
like, the best parents

653
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,066
and best childhood.

654
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,633
Did you ever feel a--a need
to just study up on black stuff?

655
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,467
Kind of.
It wasn't a weird thing

656
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,934
until I got to high school,
middle school.

657
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,900
People were throwing out
all these, like,

658
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,066
black references.
And I was, like, "Wait.

659
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,066
What does that mean?"
Did you grow up with,

660
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,066
like, black culture
was, like, second-hand?

661
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,066
I grew up
in an all-black family.

662
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,533
I went to all-black high school,
all-black elementary school

663
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,500
and a majority
black middle school.

664
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,633
Like, I get called "Oreo,"
like, all the time.

665
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,266
-It's obnoxious.
-Or, like, "Oh,

666
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,133
he's kind of cute
for a black guy."

667
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,066
Oh, don't even get me started
on being cute for a black guy.

668
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,066
It's kind
of a--it's really obnoxious.

669
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,200
Wait, I think you're kind
of cute for a black guy, Naomi.

670

671
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,700

flipped us the bird.

756

[Michelle] Bye, bye, birdie.

757
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,600
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.

763
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,467

a pitcher or a catcher.

00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,266

<i>When you think of Madonna,</i>

769
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,567

<i>-Bitch, I look good.</i>
<i>-[RuPaul] Oh, yeah.</i>

00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,066
It's--she's totally
expressing herself.

772
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:39,066
I think she likes
a little hanky-panky.

773
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,166
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-[Michelle] Oh!

774
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,166
[RuPaul] Not to be confused
with Bob the camp counselor.

775
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,066

<i>when she dressed</i>
<i>like a boy scout.</i>

779

Ladies, it's time

797
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,100
Tonight
on the runway,

798
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,333
I don't know
if you guys had some kind of

799
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,834
symbiotic message
to each other,

800
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:41,166
but there's a lot of kimonos
which is very interesting.

801
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,900
Thorgy, you did your take on it.

802
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,200
You kept it in geisha,
but still Thorgy's in there.

803
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,233
The Michael Jackson
was so good.

804
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,100
I loved all of it.

805
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,967
You kept character
better than anyone.

806
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,867
It was everything for me.

807
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:54,700
[laughs]

808
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,166
Up next, Acid Betty.

809
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,166
I was not expecting
to see "Bedtime Stories"

810
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,100
and the whole
bird-fly-out thing.

811
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,166
-So kudos to that.
-Thank you.

812
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,934
I think your make-up
is okay tonight.

813
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:05,133
It's nothing spectacular.

814
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:08,367
But where I was really let down,
was in the Snatch Game, Betty.

815
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:09,200
It didn't look like her.

816
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
It was like the wig
and the make-up,

817
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,400
you were like
a white Chaka Khan.

818
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,934
I didn't get
any Nancy Grace from it.

819
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,533
It felt like
you were just being you.

820
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,834
It was just a fail
all the way around.

821
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:22,066
I wasn't sure how to turn
such a serious woman funny.

822
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,967
I needed like a nasal,
angry southern voice.

823
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:26,867
And then she leans in,

824
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,367
and she wants to talk
to you on the TV

825
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,066
like she's in your living room.

826
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,066
[laughter]

827
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,233
I wish I had you as a coach.

828
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,066
Okay.

829
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,567
All right.

830
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,200
Up next, Robbie Turnter.

831
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,600
I really enjoyed your catwalk

832
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,166
because it was really fun
and playful.

833
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,166
I was really excited
about Diana.

834
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,066
And I--I think that most people
may not know who that is.

835
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,100
So I think that
how iconic she was,

836
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,867
and the voice and everything,
you kind of have to shove

837
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,367
that in people's faces
for them to get it.

838
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:56,166
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.

839
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,066
Punk took my voice away.

840
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,300
My voice kept cracking,

841
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,533
and I was going in and out
during Diana Vreeland.

842
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,934
Well,
we could hear you perfectly.

843
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:08,300
It's just, we weren't impressed
with what was being said.

844
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,867
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

845
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,934
It's becoming quite
predictable

846
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:16,333
for Naomi to come out
in basically, lingerie.

847
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,433
This is where we go, "Oh, maybe
I should switch it up now."

848
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,834
In Snatch Game,
I got lost with the boobs.

849
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:24,066
I think if you would have just
stuffed it to the max,

850
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:27,033
it would of made the character
a lot more obvious to me.

851
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,934
That was your moment
to go O-T-P.

852
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,633
I was very underwhelmed
with my performance.

853
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,066
It was not coming out,

854
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,500
and I'm, like,
so embarrassed about it.

855
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,233
All right.
Thank you, Naomi.

856
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,700
Up next, Derrick Barry.

857
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,200
So we did Britney, huh?

858
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,500
I am so grateful.

859
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,667
Oh, God.

860
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,900
You done good, girl.

861
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,200
Me and Gigi really,

862
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
really loved your
Britney performance yesterday.

863
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,166
You kept character
the whole time.

864
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,934
-You just were Britney.
-Thank you so much.

00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:09,433
And I know you're
a<i> huge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Madonna fan.</i>

870
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,867
And, like, one of
your biggest thing you said,

871
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:12,500
was when Madonna sent you,
like, a cease and desist?

872
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,400
-Yes!
-[laughs]

873
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
-Best moment of my life.
-[laughs]

874
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,834
The padding.

875
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,533
It's so good,
I wouldn't have known.

876
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,633
You are serving "womana."

877
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:23,567
This old luscious body.

878
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,266
The Snatch Game.

879
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,300
Uzo Aduba, amazing.

880
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,867
You were so good.

881
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,367
Then, we get a little
Carol Channing.

882
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,433
You gave us extra,
which was wonderful.

883
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,567
I do want to caution you,
however.

884
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:39,900
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.

885
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,600
Just keep that in
the back of your mind.

886
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:42,734
Mm-hmm.

887
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,934
All right, ladies.

888
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,066
Well, I think
we've heard enough.

889
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,066
While you untuck backstage,

890
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:49,266
the judges and I
will deliberate.

891
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,166
All right.

892
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,967
Now, just between us
material squirrels.

893
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,400
-[Michelle] [laughs]
-What do you think?

894
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,100
Thorgy Thor.

895
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Her Michael Jackson,
I thought was divine.

896
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,667
She was really good
at making fun of things

897
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,233
that are a little taboo.

898
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,066
She stayed in character
the entire time.

899
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,066
I really felt
like Michael was there.

900
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:10,066
-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
-Her runway was very creative.

901
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:13,433
But her Nancy Grace
was more like Nancy Disgrace.

902
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,600
Ooh, child.

903
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,133
How does a drag queen
do Nancy Grace

904
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:18,400
and she doesn't even
have the wig right?

905
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,333
You need a little
helmet-y blonde.

906
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,333
And then you need a few
little Nancy Grace-isms.

907
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,467
And none of that happened.
It was just like,

908
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,667
she didn't even know
who Nancy Grace was.

909
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,367
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.

910
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,433
The "League of Their Own" look
stood out from the rest.

911
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:33,433
-I would give it a B plus.
-We love Diana Vreeland.

912
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,233
We do, indeed.

913
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,467
Everything was wrong about it.

914
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,500
Why didn't she go
for the blown-back hair?

915
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,934
With the--
with the bump at the top.

916
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:40,900
Yes!

917
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,233
The worst part
of the whole thing tonight

918
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,500
with Robbie, was the--

919
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,467
[coughs feebly]

920
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,133
[whispers]
"I have no voice."

921
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,667
-Uh-huh.
-All of a sudden,

922
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,066
you don't have a voice anymore?

923
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,533
And I think she needs
to get out of her head

924
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,233
and get into my car.

925
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,400
Okay.
All right, Billy Ocean.

926
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,900
Naomi Smalls did
Tiffany Pollard. New York.

927
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,100
[Michelle] She didn't
do New York.

928
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,967
-She did not do New York.
-She wasn't New York.

929
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,367
She wasn't Connecticut.
She wasn't New Jersey.

930
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,834
She wasn't Long Island.
I don't know what she was.

931
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:06,867
But, Naomi's was my favorite
of the kimonos.

932
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,066
She made me want to wear it,
but I don't know

933
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,266
if it really screamed "Madonna."

934
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:12,600
[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.

935
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,700
The Britney blew me away.

936
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,066
I was so excited for every time

937
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:16,633
that she was going
to answer a question.

938
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,133
The runway thing,

939
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,400
I always find her a bit
timid on the runway.

940
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,533
When you're on the catwalk,

941
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,900
you've got to just
give it all you got.

942
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,500
You know, I once asked Iman

943
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,333
what is on her mind
on the runway.

944
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:32,066
And she looked at me dead
in the eyes and said, "Africa."

945
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,300
[laughs]

946
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,834
[Carson] That's what I do
when I go to bars.

947
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,367
-Oh, really?
-Yes. Think about Africa.

948
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,166
Oh-kerr!

949
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,433
Oh--
[trills, clicks tongue]

950
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:42,633
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
-She flipped the script.

951
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,166
Come back as an African-American
Carol Channing

952
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,100
doing a<i> fabulous</i>
<i>impersonation of her.</i>

953
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,433
-Right.
-And the Madonna thing,

954
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,300
it was the most
well put together

955
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,900
thought-out costume.

956
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,100
I didn't even know
leg pads were a thing.

957
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,300
There's a lot goin'
on on the stage

958
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,433
that would blow your mind, Gigi.

959
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,500
-Uh-huh.
-Show-and-tell backstage after?

960
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,467
Oh, I don't know
if you ready.

961
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,266
[laughter]

962
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:04,266
[claps]

963
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,567
Silence!

964
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,066
I've made my decision.

965
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:08,867
Bring back my girls...

966
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,400
[whispers]
Now.

967
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,133
Thorgy Thor.

968
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,233
Your Michael Jackson
was off the wall.

969
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:19,934
And your Madonna look
was something to remember.

970
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,600
Bob The Drag Queen.

971
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,066
I's was crazy
about your Snatch Game.

972
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,066
And on the runway,

973
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,600
you are one unapologetic bitch.

974
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,567
Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,

975
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,166
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

976
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,200
Thank you.

977
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,300
Thank you.

978
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,633
[applause]

979
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:44,066
You've won a collection
of handbags and wallets

980
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,166
from Lux De Ville

981
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,300
valued at $7,000.

982
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,100
Wow.
[all "oohing"]

983
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,166
[laughs]
Wow.

984
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,967
Whoo!

985
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,567
I took a risk, and it paid off.

986
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,066
Bob and Thorgy,

987
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,333
you may join the other girls.

988
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,934
Derrick Barry.

989
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,867
You are safe.

990
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,500
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

991
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,166
Acid Betty,

992
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:12,133
your runway was
an immaculate conception.

993
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:14,633
But your Nancy Grace
left us asking,

994
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,667
"Who's that girl?"

995
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:22,066
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

996
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,066
I totally agree
with Snatch Game.

997
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,266
It sucked.
But I think Snatch Game sucks.

998
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,467
Robbie Turner,

999
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,066
your runway was a hit.

1000
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:34,633
But your Snatch Game
was a swing and a miss.

1001
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,967
Naomi Smalls,

1002
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,300
your runway look was borderline.

1003
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,967
But your impersonation
of "New York"

1004
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,300
bordered on "New Jersey."

1005
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,233
Naomi Smalls.

1006
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,066
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1007
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,066
Robbie Turner,

1008
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:56,934
you are safe.

1009
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,200
Thank you.

1010
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,300
Two queens stand before me.

1011
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,433
As always, I've consulted
with the judges.

1012
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,934
But quite frankly,
I don't give a

1013
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,233
fuck what they say.

1014
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,934
Because the final decision
is mine to make.

1015
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:16,166
Ladies, this is your last chance

1016
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,500
to impress me

1017
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,667
and save yourself
from elimination.

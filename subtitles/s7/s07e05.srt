00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,547
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
hosting the Golden Globes was...

163
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,849
-...perfection.
-Perfection.

164
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,717
So, that is
what I have in my mind.

165
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,387
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis come up.
She says,"Who"?

166
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,857
-I'm educating this youngster.
-I'm not actually that young.

167
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,859
-But you're just...
-I'm just ignorant.

168
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,429
Well, listen, you kids
have a lot of work to do.

169
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,500
-We're looking at your big opening.
-No pressure.

170
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,869
-No.
-Alright, thank you.

171
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,471
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, Ru!

172
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,341
Have either of you done comedy before?

173
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,944
-Never.
-Do you two have banter prepared or...

174
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,381
What's your chemistry like?

175
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,385
You know what? We're two
very different people. Um...

176
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,256
I had to think about working with
somebody like her.

177
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,324
She's dark-sided.

178
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,829
-If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
-We're brainstorming right now

179
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:41,600
and seeing what we can play off, you know,
and make it funny and twist it in...

180
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,502
a dark-sided kind of way.

181
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:49,742
Being dark-sided is one thing but being
funny is a completely different thing.

182
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,413
Violet and Fame...
Oh, that's gonna be a laugh riot.

183
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,418
-Hi.
-Hello.

184
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,457
-Now, you're a show host, aren't you?
-Yes, I host several shows around Orlando.

185
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:09,628
-And you? Is comedy in your background?
-If a joke comes out when I'm tipsy,

186
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,632
it just comes out, but
I am not, like, a funny girl.

187
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,267
So how are you gonna make it funny?

188
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:22,007
She'll throw shade at me
and I'll throw shade at her and...

189
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,178
Well, I just want to tell you, ladies,
it's important to create a moment.

190
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:30,616
That's what stands out. Think about
when Sally Fields won her second Oscar,

191
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,854
you don't remember anything about that
ceremony except her saying, "You like me,

192
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,522
-You really like me." 
-Mm-hmm.

193
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,557
So do something special.

194
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,427
-Hey, ladies.
-Hello, darling.

195
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,929
-Hi, RuPaul.
-So, what award are you presenting?

196
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,831
We'll present
"Most Busted Drag Queen."

197
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:50,169
That gives us an opportunity
to be a little bit more cutting.

198
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,171
Great, because this is about funny banter.

199
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:58,410
We're gonna go off a subtlety thing
like, speaking just very soft and gentle,

200
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:03,749
-but very cutty.
-That's not the easiest thing to pull off.

201
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,821
You have a big personality.
Pearl, you don't have a big personality.

202
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,423
How are you gonna
overcome that for this award?

203
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:17,062
Um, I think that I have
a great personality, actually.

204
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:23,869
Pearl, I'm twisting your tits here
because you were in the bottom last week.

205
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,305
-Right.
-And I want to make sure

206
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,008
that this week you up the ante.

207
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:35,447
You kind of told me I had no personality.
That doesn't give me confidence.

208
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,420
Well, I'm hoping it will
light a fire under your ass.

209
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,064
Is there something on my face?

210
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,070
No, I'm just not convinced
and I want you to do well.

211
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,471
That's why I brought your ass here.

212
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,475
{\an8}It's so...

213
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,678
{\an8}...intense.

214
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,481
I never want to see any of my girls
not live up to their potential.

215
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,153
-This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
-Yeah, I'm aware of that.

216
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,455
Yeah.

217
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,258
All right.

218
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,061
I will see you all later.

219
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,430
Thank you, Ru.

220
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,171
I feel very uncomfortable right now.

221
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,278
{\an8}I'm, like, tripping. I don't know what...

222
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,882
{\an8}...to do.

223
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,323
-I'm over this bullshit.
-We're finishing writing.

224
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,225
We'll make it great.
Impress Kathy.

225
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,027
I, like, need a minute.

226
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,869
Pearl walked out of the workroom.
I'm not sure she's coming back at all.

227
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:15,314
{\an8}There was a standoff between Ru and Pearl.
She ended up walking out.

228
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:20,486
I'm scared that she's not coming back,
'cause this is a co-presenter team thing.

229
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,725
So..."But enough about us,
we want to thank you, the audience."

230
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,095
{\an8}Kasha and I are doing our routines.
Now, we're at the point of editing.

231
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:34,733
{\an8}I look back and Pearl's still not there.
And I'm like, "What the hell is going on"?

232
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
How are you feeling?

233
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,390
Pearl feels defeated. I'm like, "Shit!
That energy can't be in this situation."

234
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,527
<i>I'm hoping that we're</i>
<i>just gonna be able to shake this off.</i>

235
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,964
She knows that if she doesn't
do well tomorrow, she will probably...

236
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,466
...be saying good-bye.

237
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,804
-Hi! [laughing].
-Hello!

238
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,543
{\an8}Kasha and I are getting feedback
with the comedy coach, Kathy Griffin.

239
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,279
It's so great to meet you and see you.

240
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,082
I'm pretty sure we'll
knock this one out of the park.

241
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,618
-All right, what you got?
-Enough about us. We wanna thank you--

242
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,089
Cut that line. Every award show says,
"Enough about us." Okay, go ahead.

243
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,460
"Ginger Minj, or as I call her, the
'Danny Devito of drag,' is in the house."

244
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,597
Danny Devito? That's, like, the least
gay reference I've ever heard in my life.

245
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,865
-It's just--
-Gay it up!

246
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,534
-Because she's, like, so--
-Gayer!

247
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,603
-More gay!
<i>-She's just like, "Nope!</i>

248
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,474
That's not good. Shorten that. Cut this.
Do this." So it throws me for a loop.

249
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,910
Then, we're going to intro to
the first presenters and that was it.

250
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,047
So, what did you have?
Just, "And the first presenters are..."?

251
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,018
{\an8}We're like, "Ugh! Back to
the drawing board."

252
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,921
-"Girl, you look nice tonight."
-"Girl, you look nice, girl."

253
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,424
-"Do you know what we look like?"
"Girl, what?"

254
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,559
-"The number 10."
-"Girl, you is a trip."

255
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,827
Okay, stop.

256
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,532
No more "girls." No more-- You're starting
every sentence with girl.

257
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,934
To me, it's like halfway there.

258
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,037
{\an8}Okay, girl.

259
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:24,676
"Due to her Craigslist ad, I thought
she was a pig bottom. Floss, anyone?"

260
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,715
Okay. I'm gonna stop you. It's a bit
too blue, and you're hearing that from me.

261
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,417
-So--
-What does that mean, "blue"?

262
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,155
Words that may be bleeped
would be considered blue humor.

263
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,157
The more you know.

264
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:44,363
"We're simply thrilled to be
looking down upon your oily faces."

265
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,069
"It's like a Nickelback concert mosh pit,
but with less class and more body odor."

266
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:55,340
Oh, God. All right, I love that
you're shady and fun and snarky.

267
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,644
Don't direct it at
the audience and the judges.

268
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,415
It turns into such a shade shit fest,
you just end up turning them off.

269
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,851
All right.

270
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,687
I think I just completely
changed your opening.

271
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:14,026
After this altercation, there's a lot of
pressure to deliver. We need to kill it.

272
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,765
-[both] "And the nominees are..."
-"A girl who puts the cunt in country..."

273
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,367
All right, that's a Rosanne Cash joke,
so just rewrite that one.

274
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,873
"Tonight, we are here to celebrate
the brightest stars in our industry."

275
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,976
"Unfortunately, none of them
were available."

276
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,080
It's like a couple of drag queens
throwing the same old shade at each other.

277
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,348
Give 'em something new.

278
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,518
[Ginger] <i>I used to think I was funny</i>
<i>until I met Kathy Griffin.</i>

279
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,788
{\an8}I'ma have to call my momma and
have her tell me how good I am.

280
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,191
Oh, girl.

281
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:52,030
{\an8}Next, we have to vote on the queen we want
to nominate for each category.

282
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,335
Whoever wins, you get a real sense
of what the other queens think of you.

283
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:03,342
{\an8}The Shadiest Queen? Violet is going
to take that one. By a landslide.

284
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,781
{\an8}Another glorious day.

285
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,452
{\an8}Today, we're getting ready for
the first annual Despy Awards.

286
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,954
I'm just happy to be nominated.

287
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,193
I'm feeling so much better today.
How about you?

288
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,999
I feel very good today, and thank you
for being so supportive and amazing.

289
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,868
I'm just gonna have fun with it
and do a good job and...

290
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,673
bow out gracefully if that's
what destiny has in store.

291
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,276
<i>Sometimes I do feel like</i>
<i>I am stuck in my shell.</i>

292
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,580
{\an8}The majority of my teen years
were spent really angry

293
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,717
and dealing with, like,
abandonment issues and...

294
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,991
I didn't know how to talk to people.

295
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,296
I know that a lot of my issues
stem from that experience,

296
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:01,867
so, if I can learn here that
it's cool to open up more...

297
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,837
"Come out of your shell, Pearl."
It'll be a good thing in the end.

298
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,610
<i>[sings] Ooh, when I think about chicken</i>

299
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,314
<i>It makes me happy</i>

300
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:20,419
{\an8}Chickens are my favorite animal.
I grew up on a farm with lots of chickens

301
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,423
and my job was to raise them
to be beautiful and flawless for the fair.

302
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,693
You can blow-dry them
and use vitamin E on their feet.

303
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,495
Liquid bluing makes
a white chicken sparkle.

304
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,399
You show the judge its asshole
and then they say, "Your bird's healthy."

305
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,537
When I was a kid, I used to go outside
and sing random songs to my chickens.

306
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:43,008
-What?
-I'd get into it, like, "They love it."

307
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:48,280
Bitch, this visual you just gave me,
you in a barn, covered in hay.

308
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,782
I hatched chickens under
my bed in an incubator.

309
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,786
This chicken actually won me an award,
right here. Animals were my best friends.

310
00:20:54,853 --> 00:21:00,225
Imagine me about 30 pounds heavier
and a big nerd and loving chickens.

311
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,595
[clucking]

312
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,167
That's how I talk to chickens.

313
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,071
I feel good about us, Fame. It's good
we're getting to know each other.

314
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,308
Working with you has been such a pleasure.
I can't wait...

315
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,876
until I outshine you.

316
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,112

or whatever, but I really like Miss Fame.

Today, I'm starting to really see
a change in Violet for the better.

319

It's nice. I'm probably one of the only
people she considers a friend right now,

320
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,027

-Jaidynn Diore Fierce. "Hey, girl."
-Meatiest Tuck? Girl, let's be honest.

a honey baked ham in her panties.

-That brings us to our last nominee.
-[both] Pearl.

417

Pearl's tucking ability
is just like her personality.

remind you being nominated is an honor,

425

-RuPaul, I got the smack down yesterday.

-Yes, it worked. Thank you.

-Thank you.

Kennedy Davenport and
Jaidynn Diore Fierce... you are safe.

-Thank you, Ru.
-You may leave the stage.

Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

-First up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-You look gorgeous.

439
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:03,428
But you need to take it way over the top.
I see nothing over-the-top about you.

440
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,396
That's a hard job, opening the show.

441
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:10,168
That's tough, you know, to be
overshadowed by the people following you.

442
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,372
-Next up, Katya.
-You guys struggled in the opening a bit,

443
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,942
but when you accepted your award,
I thought you were so funny.

444
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,312
For your look, I just want
a little bit more volume on your hair.

445
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,049
Are you kidding me? This is from
the Brooke Hogan collection.

446
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,354
Get out your rat-tail, and start teasing.
Give us some kind of volume.

447
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,290
-Okay.
-Thank you, New Jersey's Michelle Visage.

448
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,658
Thank you.

449
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,961
Next up, Ginger Minj.

450
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:41,232
Your performance, you had, like,
an <i>All About Eve</i>, Nomi Malone in <i>Showgirls</i>

451
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,202
on the stairs moment where
you were like, "Get out of my way.

452
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,540
-This is my moment," which was fun to see.
-You should cut back on your black spray.

453
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,177
-My felt forehead?
-Just cut it back a little bit, girl.

454
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,213
Next up, Kandy Ho.

455
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,351
You look like Natalie Wood, but
this dress is not my favorite thing.

456
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,187
I think it's, like, swallowing you up
in not a good way.

457
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,290
Unfortunately, you were
paired with Ginger,

458
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:10,895
so it's up to you to up your game to
keep up with her, and she stole the show.

459
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,733
Thank you, Kandy.
Next up, Violet Chachki.

460
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,806
You look so fabulous. I look at you and
I go, "That's a modern queen." So refined.

461
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,910
In your performance, you have a tendency
 to speed up. You speed up in this way.

462
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,681
-Totally.
-Let us hear it, so we can actually laugh.

463
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,451
-Why did they vote you shadiest queen?
-There is some truth to it.

464
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:38,222
My guess is that you spend a lot of time
by yourself reading fashion magazines.

465
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,859
I look at fashion all the time.
Obviously, the Internet happened, Ru.

466
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,528
-Did you hear about it?
-Oh.

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,065
-All right, thanks, Violet.
-Thank you.

469

Next up, Miss Fame.

470
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:53,771
The short sleeve turtleneck with the
opera length glove just makes me so happy.

471
00:32:53,838 --> 00:33:00,378
Your performance with Violet, it was
low-energy for me and didn't really hit.

472
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:05,750
But I think there's a funniness about you.
You give me a modern thing about comedy.

473
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:10,722
I can really see you consciously trying
to show us more than just beauty.

474
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:14,392
I'm just wanting to get past my own head.

475
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,860
How is your head?

476
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,731
I'm thinking a lot and I know
you guys can see that.

477
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,868
I don't even know how to
turn off my thinker.

478
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,138
-Hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Okay.

479
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,007
Thank you, Miss Fame.

480
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,210
All right, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

481
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,647
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

482
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,682
[engine revs up]

483
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,551
Just between us gladiators.

484
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,722
What do you think?
Starting with Kasha Davis.

485
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,694
Here's someone who has the chops and
didn't bring it tonight. Very frustrating.

486
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,096
This is like a workhorse queen, you know,

487
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:56,868
and a workhorse queen has to
make us laugh the minute we see her.

488
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:01,172
-It didn't happen tonight.
-I could be wrong. Maybe she's hilarious.

489
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,907
-No.
-Katya.

490
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,343
Katya's acceptance speech
was a great moment.

491
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,580
She wasn't that funny as the show opened
so I was so happy she had that moment.

492
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:15,353
As a long-time fan of the show,
what I love are the layers of irony,

493
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,890
and with Katya, there is a core of irony.

494
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:24,062
-Kandy Ho.
-She would've been gone without the blue.

495
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:28,499
-Ginger ate her up.
-Kandy Ho is fading away for me.

496
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,804
-Ginger Minj.
-Well, I thought Ginger was a powerhouse.

497
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,541
Don't you think, because her partner
didn't get any of the punchlines,

498
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,310
-is she responsible at all for that?
-No.

499
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,881
That's showbiz, kid. Sometimes, you got to
elbow your way to the front of the stage.

500
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,452
Well, remind me never to perform
on the same stage as Ross, okay?

501
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,755
-Miss Fame.
-I think there was a little stumbling

502
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,990
but she picked herself back up.

503
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:57,261
Looking at her just makes me live,
die, and then come back to life.

504
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:03,634
So fresh for a queen to look like that
and then be like this honest, goofy kid.

505
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,903
-Yeah.
-Violet Chachki.

506
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,307
I noted the jokes
about her today from the other queens.

507
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:13,177
-I don't think they like her very much.
-She doesn't get on well with the others.

508
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,981
She is a child of the Internet.
That is something you do alone.

509
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,184
Frankly, she wasn't necessarily
funny and it was a let down.

510
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,621
Come on, her acceptance speech
was hilarious. Excuse me,

511
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,224
who doesn't want to be the
shadiest queen? I mean...

512
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,593
how punk rock is that?

513
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,330
Silence. I've made my decision.

514
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,765
Bring back my... girls?

515
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:42,073
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

516
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,108
Ginger Minj...

517
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,344
you're safe.

518
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,950
Kandy Ho... tonight
you looked like Natalie Wood,

519
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,254
but your delivery was a little wooden.

520
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,525
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.

521
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,494
Miss Fame...

522
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,296
you're safe.

523
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,433
Katya... you're safe.

524
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,774
Violet Chachki... your jokes
got lost in the shade.

525
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:22,780
Mrs. Kasha Davis, your big opening
was a little sloppy.

526
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:33,691
Mrs. Kasha Davis, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

527
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,329
Violet Chachki... you're safe.

528
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,638
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance to impress me

529
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,842
and save yourself from elimination.

530
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,613
The time has come.

531
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,848

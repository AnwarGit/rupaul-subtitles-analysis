00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,400
- I IDOLIZED COURTNEY BEFORE
I CAME INTO THIS COMPETITION.

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,266
MEETING HER
WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,

172
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,433
SO GETTING TO WORK WITH HER
IS KIND OF SURREAL.

173
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:34,433
- NEXT, BIANCA AND TRINITY.

174
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,300
- DIDN'T I SAY TO THE UNIVERSE

175
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
THAT I DO NOT WANT TO WORK
WITH TRINITY AGAIN?

176
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
THANKS, RU, YOU SHADY BITCH.

177
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,700
- I'M ASSIGNING YOU
GLAMOROUS WORKING GIRLS,

178
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,367
FROM HOOKERS TO C.E.O.s.

179
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,867
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH BIANCA.

180
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,500
I JUST WANT TO WORK BY MYSELF.

181
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,800
I WANT A CHALLENGE WHERE
I COULD JUST THINK ON MY OWN.

182
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,066
- AND THAT LEAVES BENDELACREME
AND DARIENNE LAKE.

183
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,667
- REALLY? REALLY?

184
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,734
- YOU'LL TARGET THE COUGAR DEMO,

185
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:08,000
MATURE LADIES WHO ONLY GET
SEXIER WITH THE PASSING YEARS.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,867
- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION

187
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,066
BETWEEN DARIENNE AND I LATELY,

188
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,667
BUT I THINK THAT
SHE'S SUPER-TALENTED,

189
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,934
SO I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD PAIRING.

190
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:22,266
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.

191
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,934
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I JUST--

192
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,500
I'M JUST WRITING, LIKE,
STUPID LITTLE SHIT.

193
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,400
- OK.
- SOMETHING VERY BITCHY FOR
THE DEMOGRAPHIC KIND OF THING.

194
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,900
- RIGHT, LIKE THE MEAN GIRLS,
BUT, LIKE, RICH.

195
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,667
- RICH, BRATTY WHORES.

196
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,233
- ADORE AND I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE

197
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,000
BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
MANY TIMES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,800
I'M JUST REALLY NERVOUS
THAT ADORE WILL OVERSHADOW ME

199
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,633
AND THAT I WON'T BE THE STAR.

200
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:45,100
- "THIS SASSY, SEXY,
SICKENING PRODUCT..."

201
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
- [CHUCKLES]

202
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,834
MMM...
- WE COULD SAY,

203
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,533
"NOW THAT WE GOT OUR HANDS
ON THIS BITCHING MAKEUP..."

204
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,834
- [LAUGHS]

205
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,000
FUCK.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,533
SO LAGANJA HAS IDEAS,

207
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,100
AND I MEAN, I WAS RAISED RIGHT,

208
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,066
SO ALL I CAN DO IS
NERVOUS LAUGH AT THEM

209
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,500
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO RESPOND TO THEM.

210
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,567
I'M NOT GONNA SAY, "NO, BITCH,
THAT'S AN AWFUL IDEA.

211
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,100
MINE IS BETTER."

212
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,567
BUT THAT WAS THE TRUTH
OF THE SITUATION.

213
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:09,133
- "ALL THE HOT BOYS WILL BE
KISSING THESE COATED LIPS,"

214
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,233
OR SOMETHING LIKE...

215
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,100
- UM...I DON'T KNOW.

216
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,400
I WANT TO BE MORE MEAN.

217
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,467
LIKE, "SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S MINE NOW."

218
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,867
- SO, LIKE, I'M PUTTING
ON THE LIP GLOSS,

219
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,767
LIKE, "I CAN SLEEP
WITH ANYONE I CHOOSE."

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,900
- SO I'M PICTURING US MAYBE
TO BE, LIKE, DRUNK LUSHES.

221
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,467
- OH, OK.
- YOU KNOW, LIKE...

222
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,200
- HAVE PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.

223
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,266
- YEAH, PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.

224
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,800
- OK, OK.

225
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
- I CANNOT EVEN WRAP MY BRAIN
AROUND IT AT THIS MOMENT

226
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,900
THAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS
THING WITH COURTNEY ACT HERSELF.

227
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,533
SHE HAS SO MUCH RESPECT FOR ME,

228
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,166
AND I, OF COURSE,
HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HER.

229
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,734
I THINK, LIKE, WE SHOULD
DO MAKEOVERS, LIKE IN DRAG.

230
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,600
- DOES ONE OF US WANT TO BE.
LIKE, A BEFORE,

231
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,166
AND ONE OF US WANT TO BE AFTER?

232
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,233
- IMAGINE IF YOU'RE THE BEFORE?

233
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:57,433
- BUT THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE
WOULD EVER BELIEVE THAT YOU
WERE THE AFTER, RIGHT?

235

HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL
YOUR WORKING GIRL?

237
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,100
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.

238
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,433
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA,"

239
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,767
BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT BEFORE,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

240
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,000
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

242
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,834
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.

DOGS, MAKEUP, CELL PHONE--
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO THEM.

251
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,667

THAT HAS PROBABLY UNDERGONE
SOME RENOVATIONS...

00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,467
- SURE.

291
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:55,567
- BUT COULD USE
A FRESH COAT OF PAINT

292
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,533
TO COVER SOME OF
THE NEWLY REWORKED FOUNDATION.

293

- SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SELL MY PRODUCT?

305
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:24,967

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,467
"CHILD, I'M ON THESE STREETS
ALL NIGHT,

"AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

HAVE CALLED YOU OUT ON
YOUR CONFIDENCE BEFORE.

316
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,767
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
TURN THAT AROUND?

317
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,667
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.

318
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,066
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA."

319
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,333
- I'M--I--I'M...

320
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,867
- BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT
BEFORE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

321
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,433
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,

322
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,500
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

323
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,100
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.

324
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,633
- AM I THE FIRST PERSON
TO CALL YOU OUT ON THIS ISSUE

325
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,066
WITH PROJECTING
AND BEING MORE OUT THERE?

326
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,800
- THIS IS--IT'S HONESTLY
ALL NEW TO ME.

327
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,633
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THE WAY THAT I TALK

328

OR COMMUNICATION OR ANYTHING.

329
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,033
- BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST
THE WAY THAT YOU TALK.

330
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,934
IT'S A PROJECTION THING,
YOU KNOW.

I'M TRYING TO DRAG,
PUN INTENDED, YOURSELF OUT,

IT'S THERE.

334
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:31,600
- YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER
THAT EXACT SAME FIRE
INTO OTHER AREAS.

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,233
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT.

841
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,934
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,

842
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:32,367
BIANCA DEL RIO
AND TRINITY K. BONET-NAY.

843
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:36,433
- I THINK ON THE RUNWAY,
THEY WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEST.

844
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:40,033
- AS FAR AS THE INFOMERCIAL
GOES, THEY GOT THE JOB DONE.

845
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,567
I FEEL LIKE WE SAW
A SIDE OF TRINITY

846
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,100
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE.

847
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,533
WE GOT TO SEE TRINITY SPEAKING
UP AND REALLY ENJOYING IT,

848
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:46,800
AND THAT WAS REFRESHING.

849
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,066
- NOT MY FAVORITE AD.

850
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,433
THE BEFORE AND AFTERS--

851
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:53,266
IT WASN'T THAT BIG
OF A TRANSFORMATION FOR ME.

852
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:55,033
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
UNTIL THIS MOMENT.

853
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,367
- [LAUGHTER]

854
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,633
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BENDELACREME AND DARIENNE LAKE.

855
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,834
- WELL, THE COMMERCIAL--

856
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:05,867
I MEAN, IT WAS A VERY STRANGE
ATTACK ON THE PRODUCT.

857
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:06,867
- [LAUGHTER]

858
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,233
- VERY STRANGE ATTACK ON THE...

859
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,834
- IN FACT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE PRODUCT WAS, YOU KNOW?

860
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,066
IT WAS A BUTCHERING.

861
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,367
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE SELLING MAKEUP.

862
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,967
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
ALL ABOUT THE SURGERY.

863
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:16,467
THE FACES THEY WERE PULLING
WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL.

864
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:19,667
WE LOVE THOSE FACES,
BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO SELL COSMETICS.

865
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:24,000
- TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
I DID NOT FANCY BENDELACREME.

866
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,066
- THE HAIR LOOKED LIKE A PENIS
WRAPPED IN A BANDAGE.

867
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,500
-  [LAUGHTER]

868
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,100
- IT WAS VERY WEIRD.

869
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,700
- AND I DO NOT KNOW WHO DELA IS
AT ALL EXCEPT A COSTUME QUEEN.

870
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,867
I FEEL LIKE TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,

871
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,000
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT PERSON
IS UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT.

872
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,533
- LET'S TALK ABOUT COURTNEY ACT
AND JOSLYN FOX.

873
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,900
- COURTNEY WAS REALLY FUN
ON THE RUNWAY TONIGHT.

874
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,467
I LOVE THE LOOK SHE WAS GIVING.

875
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,800
JOSLYN--I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE...

876
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
- BUT I THINK YOU CAN BELIEVE
SHE WOULD WEAR THAT.

877
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,166
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S TRUE.

878
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,400
- AREN'T YOU FROM SOUTH
PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY?

879
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,066
- HOLLA.
- [LAUGHS]

880
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,667
- THE POINT, IS YOU JUST WORE
WHAT YOU WORE LAST WEEK

881
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,400
AFTER WE SO HARSHLY CRITIQUED
YOU, IN ANOTHER COLOR?

882
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,100
AND THEN PUT YOUR BOY HAIR ON?

883
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,967
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
WHEN PEOPLE GET CHARACTERS

884
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,767
LIKE STAY-AT-HOME MOM,

885
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,867
THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANS THAT
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY MATRONLY.

886
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,900
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.
- NO, THEY DIDN'T.

887
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,367
- THEY DIDN'T OVERDO IT.

888
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,266
- I THOUGHT COURTNEY
WAS SO, LIKE, DUMBED DOWN.

889
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,233
- SHE WAS DRAB.

890
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,033
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.

891
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,200
- WELL, SHE DOES
THIS REALNESS THING.

892
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,633
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS DOING
IN THE COMMERCIAL.

893
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:20,700
- RIGHT.
- I DON'T WANT REAL.

894
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
I WANT A DRAG QUEEN.

895
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,200
- OK, BUT THAT
WASN'T THEIR COMMERCIAL!

897
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,767
- JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH,
AM I ON ANOTHER SHOW?

898
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,834
- NOW, LEAH, YOU LIKE THIS AD.
TELL US WHY.

899
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,333
- I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.

901
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,433

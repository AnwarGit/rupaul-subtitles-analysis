{\an8}For this week's maxi-challenge,
you will prance your padded asses off.
{\an8}-So are you guys good dancers?
-No.
{\an8}-I'm not.
-You look like you're a little worried.
{\an8}-Maybe a little more graceful.
-Ah!
{\an8}[Carson] <i>Your tango was very correct.</i>
Katya and Violet.
Condragulations,
you're winners of the challenge.
[Katya] Oh, my God!
Ginger Minj. Shantay, you stay.
Trixie Mattel, sashay away.
{\an8}Son of a bitch, girl.
{\an8}Ugh. "Stay plastic, Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}P.S. Spoiler alert:
Trixie doesn't win. LOL."
{\an8}Oh, God.
{\an8}It really hits home
when I see Trixie's message.
{\an8}<i>I'm sad that she's the one</i>
<i>that I had to send home,</i>
{\an8}but I'm happy that I'm still here.
{\an8}But enough of this sad shit.
Congratulations to our winners.
-[Pearl] Yes!
-[Katya] Yes.
-[Ginger] You seemed surprised, Katya.
-I didn't know what happened.
-[Violet] We worked our asses off.
-[Katya] We worked really hard.
And I'm so proud of us.
Does being the only one
who has not had to lip-sync scare you?
Do y'all think my time is coming?
{\an8}I just want to see you lip-sync,
'cause I haven't seen it this season.
{\an8}Really, girl?
[Violet] How does it feel
to have a weakness?
I feel you've been strong
this entire competition,
but I feel like I've really got to see
your weakness this week.
I've got plenty of weaknesses.
What you don't see is when I go home,
I sob like a fucking baby,
and I come back in with my game face on.
-Never let 'em see you sweat.
-That's what the competition is about.
And don't rest on your laurels, bitch.
Because we all know that with only
one thread hanging, your ass is packing.
-Because there's how many now?
-Five!

The old lady brigade has made it.
Can we hear it for senility?
{\an8}Top five. You can count 'em on one hand,
and I'm one of them.
This one.
You came in
in this whole Russian doll thing.
I thought you were from Russia.
I was like, "They flew this bitch in?"
Most people who come to my show
don't know that I'm not Russian,
'cause I talk in this Russian accent.
Does anybody else do
other languages, accents or anything?
No, I can barely speak fucking English.
-[alarm sounds]
-Here we go, honey.
[RuPaul] <i>She done</i>

-<i>Hey, queens</i>.
-Hey.
<i>From Tuckahoe to Tokyo, whether you're</i>
<i>a couture queen or somebody's BFF,</i>

Konnichiwa<i>, bitches.</i>
[laughter]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi!
Come through, ruffles.
[RuPaul] Ladies, at this point
in the competition,
you probably know what the other queens
are gonna say before they do.
So for today's mini-challenge,
it's your chance to prove it...
with puppets!
-Because why?
-[all] Because everybody loves puppets.
See?
Pick a puppet that represents
one of your competitors and drag it up.
All right. First up, Katya.
Step over to the gloryhole-elujah.
Dig deep for a puppet.
-Who'd you get?
-Ginger Minj.
All right. Next up, Ginger Minj.
Don't be scurred.
-Violet.
-Bitch, my hair is layered.
I don't know what they're talking about.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-[Pearl] There's something slimy in there.
[Pearl] Yes!
All right, Kennedy. You're up.
All right, Violet.
Get over there and stick it in the hole.
[laughter]
I don't have that much hair.
All right.
It's time to drag up your puppet
using supplies
from the Fabric Planet wall.
Go!
[electronic music playing]
Can I borrow one of your regular outfits?
I think it'll fit this doll.
-Try making something.
-I'll learn sewing when you learn acting.
Done.
The key to capturing my essence
is capturing my scent visually.
[RuPaul] Time's up.
All right, ladies.
Let the bitch-fest begin.
Hi, Kennedy. Start by telling us
where you got this inspiration from.
Girl, this is what happens
when a bad trick goes wrong.
He threw me into the embers
where I arose as a phoenix.
What was that look?
<i>It's gonna go down in history</i>
<i>as the deranged Tony the Tiger.</i>
Hi, everybody.
I want you to meet my girlfriend, Pearl.
Why don't you have any titty pants on?
I mean...
This is how we do it in New York.
-Does her mouth move at all?
-Oh, look at me.
[Kennedy] I love it.
I don't have to wear pants.
-Yes, you do, miss thing. This is drag.
-I mean...
-[snoring]
-[Kennedy] Miss Pearl.
Miss Pearl!
Miss thing!
{\an8}These bitches need some new material.
I woke up a long time ago, goddamn it.
-Oh, wow, and who do we have here?
-That looks just like me.
-Hi, I'm Katya Slobonanobblebitch.
-Is that Russian? Are you from Russia?
No.
Go you, Katya.
I can't wait to see more from you.
Yeah, I can't wait too.
I'm gonna go smoke something.
Meth.
-Hi. What's your name?
-Ginger Minj, from Leesburg, Florida.
About three minutes north of Gatorland,
which is where I learned to do my makeup.
Wow! So alligators
taught you how to do your makeup?
I spray my forehead black, let it
drip down and blend that into my cheeks.
Wow. That's revolutionary.
Your name, Violet Chachki, is interesting.
Where does that come from?
I wanted to figure out what was beautiful
and completely worthless.
A tchotchke!
I'm trying to train myself
with this corset.
I'm really trying to get down to 2 inches.
-Why haven't you gotten there yet?
-Your wrist is fat and shoved inside me.
I'll never get down to 2 inches.
-And scene.
-Oh, my God!
Ooh, y'all some shady ass ladies.
But one of you
was quite the puppet master.
The winner of today's mini-challenge is...
Ginger Minj!
Ah! I take credit.
I'll post all the best bitch-fest moments
at logotv.com.
Ladies, America's next drag superstar
needs to know how to brand her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent.
For inspiration, you'll be joining forces
with a global marketing phenomenon
-worth over $8 billion.
-Is that a real number?
A girl who's besties with Miley Cyrus,
Lady Gaga, and Nicki Minaj,
and has her own line of makeup,
jewelry, dolls.
Ladies, please give
a big drag-race welcome to...
Hello Kitty!
Hey, Kitty Girl. Come on down here.
<i>Konnichiwa</i>, bitches.
-Oh, my God.
-Hi!
It's so great to have you on the show.
For this week's maxi-challenge,
you'll be designing and creating
your very own runway eleganza,
{\an8}using products provided
by Hello Kitty herself, #HelloKittyGirl.
Although your dress
will be made with Hello Kitty items,
the final look needs to scream you.
Now, Ginger Minj, you won the bitch-fest.
So you get a head start
on grabbing all the goodies.
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.
-Go!
-Ooh!
I don't know what I'm gonna make
because I'm not a costume designer.
So I just start grabbing
whatever I can find.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Let's go this way, darling.
[electronic music playing]
I have had my fill
of these damn design challenges.
Please don't make me sew again.
This is the part of <i>Drag Race</i>
I don't like.
Kennedy's stressed about this challenge.
Katya seems stressed about this challenge.
These bitter old ladies
got a lot of work cut out for them.
Take your Metamucil, girls.
This is gonna be a rough one.
[electronic music playing]
Ugh!
{\an8}We have to create a couture look
entirely out of Hello Kitty materials.
I'm all about having concepts
and having them executed flawlessly.
I'm excited to do this fucking challenge.
You have no idea.
I'll do black and pink, and then do
my thigh boots and juice them up
with my fishnets
and give that kind of look.
{\an8}I want to make it look sexy,
like, Becky, who's 21 years old
{\an8}with a hot boyfriend
and who have a fetish for Hello Kitty.
-What's your plan?
-I don't know.
I'm into period looks,
and I haven't done a '60s thing yet.
-Oh.
-So I want to go, like, mod.
-What about you?
-I don't know. I have no fucking idea.
I could use this to shield
the judges from my horrible outfit.
-Like really fierce.
-Oh, my God. How avant-garde is that?
-It looks so great from the side...
-Yes, Gaga, come through.
Lady Gaga, you look amazing.
Work! Oh, it's Katya.
-We'll get some inspo.
-I'm working on it.
-Maybe I can help.
-Don't pressure me!
Katya has relied on humor her whole life.
Presenting a fashion thing is a struggle.
She has so much talent,
and I just wish she would focus.
-You have something I don't have.
-Beauty?
You have this hairy mole on your back.
No, you have this unshakeable confidence.
-I so admire that.
-Thank you.
Drag is all about confidence, I feel.
That's why I like it.
{\an8}I'm gonna try to absorb
a bit of Violet's confidence.
This is my confident face.
[hinges squeak]
-Hello, hello, hello. Look who's back.
-[all] Hi!
-[Violet] Oh, my God!
-[Kennedy] Oh, my goodness!
It's Santino. He's here to help you
with your Hello Kitty eleganza.
Santino Rice walks through that door,
and I flood my basement, bitch.
That is one sexy man.
Newark. LaGuardia. Kennedy.
This looks gorgeous, these little bows.
-I'm accessorizing with the bows.
-Uh-huh.
I'm dying that their bows are gone.
-I want to know what's Kennedy's style.
-Kennedy is a catsuit queen.
-I'm an entertainer. I dance, so...
-Yeah.
-Do you know how to make a catsuit?
-No.
Oh. Okay.
Like somebody who love enchiladas
but don't know how to make 'em.
In my head I'm like, "I am not creative,
but what do you want to do?"
You are creative. That's why you're here.
So let's see something.
Get back to work. I cannot wait
to see what you come up with.
Thank you very much.
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-Hi. Meet Santino.
-Hi, Santino.
-Hey, how are you?
-You look so dapper.
Thank you.
Now, I wanted you to meet Santino
because he also studied fashion,
knew all of the silhouettes.
-Do you have any questions for Santino?
-Can we go to Red Lobster?
I want to do something kind of...
bubblegum pop mod meets Harajuku.
Everything you described to us
is really incredible.
This boning you're using,
that's for your head?
[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness. Wow.
Violet looks like the human gaydar, bitch.
What the hell?
Now, you've set the standard really high.
-Let's see something amazing out of you.
-I will do my very best.
All right, get to work,
and we'll see you out there.
-Hi, Katya.
-Hi.
You won the challenge last week.
How will you keep the momentum going?
I'm just-- I don't know.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
If you start doing something,
it will lead you to where you need to be.
But if it stays in your head,
you're not gonna get out of the gate.
I would say first and foremost,
if you can somehow incorporate Hello Kitty
into who Katya is,
you're gonna be all right.
-Listen. The clock is running out. Okay?
-Make it work.
I don't want to fuck up this challenge,
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
-Hey, Pearl.
-Hi, RuPaul. Hi, Santino.
-So, <i>flazéda</i>.
-<i>Flazéda</i>. It's the new hashtag.
-It's spreading like wildfire.
-It sure is. It's all the rage.
-Did you make that up?
-I guess so. I thought it was a real word.
-Maybe I thought of it in a dream.
-Yeah.
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't make it any less real, Pearl.
What can Pearl bring to this challenge?
Maybe some sort of pooled skirt,
maybe even like a hobble dress.
-[RuPaul] Very <i>flazéda</i>.
-Very that.
-The skirt's gonna be out of this blanket?
-This plush, yeah.
{\an8}I'm interested to see
how Pearl's gonna do with this,
{\an8}because she is always long,
drapey and flowing.
None of this fabric
is particularly long, drapey, or flowing.
Hello Kitty, good-bye, Pearl.
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi.
You don't sew?
-No. I don't.
-How far along are you in this?
-I cut out this panel so far.
-That can be a problem, Ginger.
-You've been in the bottom two twice.
-And both of those design challenges.
Do you have
a foundation garment that you wear?
I have shorts with the hips
and the ass built into them.
-And you cinch your waist or...
-I don't.
When I first started drag,
my drag mother said to me,
"It looks stupid when big girls corset
and got stuff bubbling here and there."
If you make something for your body,
it will accentuate the positives
and eliminate the negatives.
I would really encourage you
to cinch in your shape a little bit.
You look a little defeated here.
-I'm trying to figure out my next move.
-Well, we're running out of time here.
So get to work and let those juices flow.
I want to crawl underneath
the workstation and fucking die.
All right, ladies, gather around.
Tomorrow, Santino will be back
on the judges' panel to let you have it.
So good luck, and don't...
Wait a minute, wait.
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.
Oh, pit crew!
[gasps]
[RuPaul] In addition
to your Hello Kitty eleganza,
you need to create a second look.
That's right, you need
to turn yourself into a character
that Hello Kitty would be proud
to call her new BFF.
And by all means, help yourself
to supplies from the Fabric Planet wall.
[Katya] <i>I don't have a first outfit,</i>
and I have to make
a new character and outfit to go with it.
Ah... Fucking fuck.
-Good luck, and...
-[both] Don't fuck it up.
I want to throw my hands up in the air
and say,
"It's been real, y'all.
Peace. I'll see you at the reunion."
[electronic music playing]
{\an8}Ugh! So now there's a twist.
<i>Not only do we have to create</i>
<i>a Hello Kitty-inspired look for ourselves,</i>
we have to create
an entirely new Hello Kitty character.
Ugh...
-[Violet] These aren't easy to see out of.
-[Pearl] You can't see?
-[Ginger] I can't see.
-[Violet] You can't see shit.
-[Pearl] Is this a joke?
-[Violet] We have to walk like this.
[Ginger] How? Oh, my God.
{\an8}It's really impossible
to try to serve face in this head.
What kind of nose
does a cow have?
Like a snout.
{\an8}I don't know
how the hell I'm gonna pull this off.
[electronic music playing]
Oh, my gosh. Okay. So...
I don't I have my first outfit,
and I have to make
a new character and outfit to go with it,
and I have no idea what it is.
[Pearl] Ah! Oh, my God.
-How does this look?
-Gorgeous.
-How you doing over there, Katya?
-[Katya] Ugh...
I'm okay.
The other girls have no idea
what's happening in my mind right now
because I am a master
of hiding my turbulent emotions,
but I am flipping the fuck out.
I just feel like I'm fucked.
{\an8}-[Ginger] Ouch!
-[Kennedy]  Girl...
{\an8}Kennedy] Don't be pushin' on me.
I'ma tell!
I feel pretty good.
I'm pleased with my look so much.
I think it's flawless.
How's yours coming, Katya?
Um, well...
I think in the pantheon
of bad decision-making...
I think my runway outfit is like...
-The one?
-The one.
Commit to your look.
Yesterday, I had a total panic attack,
but last night I started working
on my Hello Kitty BFF character,
and I love what I'm coming up with,
but I have to finish my main stage outfit,
and I have like, no time.
I need another cat head.
I love makeup, but we're not all
legendary makeup artists like you, Pearl.
-No, I'm not.
-You're known for your makeup.
{\an8}I've been drawing Pearl since I was ten.
Pearl was a character I would draw 'cause
it distracted me from the horrible things
that I felt were going on around me.
<i>As I got older</i>
<i>and started to realize I was gay,</i>
I just realized that all the things I love
when you boil it down, it's drag.
And then one day just...
painted her on me instead of the paper.
[Violet] You're so <i>flazéda</i>, Pearl.
My makeup today's gonna be <i>flazéda</i>.
I'm gonna channel that.
Fuck. Right. Off.

Hello, my pretty kitties.
It's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Violet Chachki.
Let's talk about your BFF.
She was super fun, still vain.
-I think you did a good job tonight.
-I love this look.
-[Rebecca] I'm having waist envy.
-It's Barbarella. It's beautiful.
What I love most about it
is it's different for Violet Chachki.
Thank you so much.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
I love what you did with your BFF.
I loved your voice-over.
For me, where this fell short...
It's just a tiny bit too literal.
I love it. It's fun.
You look like a basketful of kitties.
It's like you're overflowing with kitties.
If you bent over, more kitties would fall.
[laughter]
Ginger's having a problem
with a fucking horsefly that's landing...
It's so great to actually be here.
-[Violet] Got it.
-[RuPaul] She got it.
[RuPaul] It's right there.
Thank you, Ginger.
Next up, Pearl.
The easiest way to my heart
is to pull a Madonna out of your pocket
and basically
that's what I got with your BFF.
[Carson] But like, if Madonna
and a marshmallow had a baby.
-Sounds delicious.
-[Carson] It does, doesn't it?
The first thing that comes to mind
when I see your outfit
is when Giorgio di Sant'Angelo
went into the desert with Veruschka.
All he did was wrap blankets around her
and gave really beautiful face.
-That's what I was actually going for.
-Really?
-What was the toughest part of this?
-My looks are very minimal.
I just didn't want to throw
a bunch of Hello Kitty trinkets on me
to get the point across, so...
-Was that a read?
-Yes, it was.
-Thank you, Pearl.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Katya.
-<i>Privyet</i>.
For your BFF, loved your voice-over.
I loved that you added
some international flavor to the Meow Mix.
Then we have the look, the eleganza.
I'm a bit confused by it
because the hair to me
doesn't go with the outfit.
You're giving us hot futuristic
space mom who loves Hello Kitty.
[laughter]
-Was that it?
-Get out of my head.
So, 1960s stuntwoman
coerced into prostitution
on her way to fashion week in Chernobyl.
You could've taken it even further,
gotten your point of view across better.
Thank you, Katya.
Next up, Newark. LaGuardia.
Kennedy Davenport.
On the runway, it's a miss for me.
It's basic what you did on the bodysuit.
[Santino] To cut out all these bows
and then sew them on in rows.
I thought you were doing
an amazing flourish.
The challenge was to stick
to who we are, and this is me.
It could be a bit more adventuresome
for you to try some more daring looks.
That transferred over to your BFF.
It was a little bit sassy.
-But it wasn't enough for me.
-What kept you from going further with it?
I wish I had
some creativity like these ladies.
Actually, you do.
And that's why it's strange for us.
Because we see you in a way
that you're clearly not seeing yourself.
Well, thank you, ladies.
While you go untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
For tonight's deliberation,
we have an extra special guest.
Just between us kitty girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Violet Chachki.
Her Hello Violet character
was more tame than her extravaganza look.
I actually appreciated that she was
a little tame on her Hello Violet
because you are dealing
with such an iconic brand like that.
Her Hello Kitty couture was fabulous.
She really delivers what we've asked for.
She has a great eye for proportion.
Violet's a creative powerhouse.
She has a million silhouettes in her head,
and she's brought it to us every time.
-Why are you gagging so?
-She bring it to you, every ball.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Her BFF look was amazing.
She's very detail-oriented.
I don't have any beefs with this look.
It really moo-ved me.
It worked beautifully with the brand.
That being said, I was not blown away
by the Hello Kitty couture.
I would've liked to have seen
some more whimsicality.
How could she be more whimsical?
She had hair, ears,
<i>a bow in her head,</i>
<i>stuffed animals on her boobs.</i>
-That's not whimsical enough?
-Are we talking about Ginger or you?
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>
She created for her couture look
a glamorous, dramatic, plushy character.
It's a wraparound blanket.
Only somebody who weighs
82 pounds wet could pull that look off,
where you could wear a blanket
and call it a dress.
<i>Hello Kitty BFF.</i>
<i>The Madonna vibe made me so happy.</i>
She was having fun,
which is a really big deal for Pearl,
who always looks like she's half-asleep.
-But Kitty wouldn't hang out with her.
-And shoplift.
So, Hello Kitty,
would you hang out with Hello Pearl?
[RuPaul] No, no...
[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
I loved her Hello Kitty BFF.
It was so wrong, it was strong.
It was hilarious and irreverent,
and I think drag should do that.
There's no way Hello Kitty's allowed
to hang out with this Russian hooker.
Hello Kitty, would you hang out
with an older Russian woman
who smokes cigarettes from Siberia?
[Santino] Oh. Oh, wow. Maybe. Huh.
The eleganza. I didn't like it at all.
None of it went together.
I actually get what she was going for
with the hairdo and the pearls.
I thought it looked like futuristic,
like, Jetsons.
[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Her character, it never delivered.
She had an idea that just fizzled.
Her look was a basic ho-stroll outfit.
She just glued bows and pincushions.
You're gonna mutilate a hundred
Hello Kitty dolls and take their bows off,
and you're gonna use them like that?
No, you're not.
Ask Hello Kitty what she thought about
how she used all those bows.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my litter.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your Hello Kitty presentations,
I've made some decisions.
Pearl...
you're safe.
Kennedy Davenport,
your round-the-way girl
could've used more twirl.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki. This week,
you were a real glamor-puss.
Condragulations,
you are the winner of this challenge.
You've won
a Hello Kitty extravaganza package,
featuring accessories
to add Hello Kitty realness to your life.
Thank God.
{\an8}I'm the winner,
and I feel it was well goddamn deserved.
Ginger Minj, you grabbed
a hold of this challenge and milked it
for all it was worth.
You're safe.
Katya, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
-The time has come...
-[thunder clap]
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life!
{\an8}I want to perform
the shit out of this number.
<i>I want to be in the top four so badly.</i>
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

[Violet] Yes! Come through!
Wow!
Ladies, I've made my decision.

-Thank you.

-Thank you.

Pearl, come out of your shell.
I feel picked on, almost.
Kennedy Davenport, you are

Pearl, shantay, you stay.
Trixie Mattel, sashay away.
{\an8}-Girl. Long day.
-Oh, my God, I have been through it today.
{\an8}I am in complete shock. Trixie should be
here. This is a fucking travesty.
{\an8}Pearl, do you think the
judges' critiques were fair tonight?
{\an8}I'm really just kind of over the judges.
I thought I gave great energy.
{\an8}Back home, everybody loves me.
<i>At first, I thought I was so sickening,</i>
<i>everyone would just be obsessed with me,</i>
but obviously that's not the case.
Good riddance to this fucking day.
-I didn't expect it to be Trixie.
-I gagged. I truly gagged.
{\an8}The vibe around the workroom
 is a little bit shocked.
This may sound like old lady bullshit
but after trying for this for seven years
and someone says, "fuck this,"
that pisses me off.
Yeah.

-[car revving]
-[laughter]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hello.
Hi.
You know Drag Race viewers create
the most twisted fan art in the world.
One super fan blew everyone away
{\an8}by recreating our queens'
hottest looks using only... paper.
Yeah. Paper.
For today's Mini-Challenge,
you'll be making your own paper versions
of classic celebrity red carpet outfits.
Now, you'll be working in pairs.
So based on how you lined up this morning,
teams are: Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
-Lil' Kim.
-Yay.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce and
Kennedy Davenport, Lady Gaga. [gasps]
-Pearl and Max, Cher.
-Ooh.
Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya, Björk.
And Violet Chachki and Miss Fame,
Jennifer Lopez.
{\an8}I'm paired up with Violet
and I'm the glass half-full.
She's like the empty beer bottle
that you find, like, next to the chair.
Oh, pit crew!
[RuPaul laughs]
I see the morning paper has arrived.
[laughter] Ooooh.
Oh, read all about it.
This is gonna be the best game
of frock, paper, scissors ever.
Go!
-Good?
-Yeah.
Hurry up, bitch. Tape this shit.
-You don't have to fucking slap me.
-If I get the chance.
All right, time's up, ladies.
First up...
[laughter]
{\an8}Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
Look at Lil' Kim.
{\an8}<i>It's from the line, I don't give a tit.</i>
Whomp, whomp.  I had
to do that. [laughter]
{\an8}Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce and
Kennedy Davenport, Lady Gaga.
{\an8}Yes, ma'am, wet and juicy
in all the right places.
The "steaks" are high, ladies.
[laughter]
{\an8}Next up, Violet Chachki and Miss Fame.
"Jenny from the block".
{\an8}Wow, Versace.
It's actually "Versnatch".
Turn around, J-Lo, let's see the backside.
You're not Jennifer Lopez!
[laughter]
Next up, Pearl and Max.
Dark lady.
{\an8}No tramp or thief could steal
this custom couture.
Shut up, stupid.
[laughter]
Born naked and the rest is Bob Mackie.
{\an8}Next up, re-creating the
infamous swan dress, Katya.
-And... is that Joan Rivers?
-What are you wearing?
Actually, I'm wearing a custom-made
Klein Epstein &amp; Parker suit.
Stunning. And this next gal,
she's wearing a swan on her body
and a elephant on her ankles.
Now available on iTunes.
Björk flew all the way from Iceland
for this, and, boy, are her arms tired.
Yes. The rest of her looks tired, too.
Next thing, you'll look like Pearl, honey.
Good job, ladies. I've graded
your papers and the winning pair is...
Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya.
I'm posting all of your
paper doll looks at logotv.com.
Ladies, you're all dressed up.
Now you need a place to go. Good news.
You're invited to the most prestigious
award show of the season,
girl! The first annual Despy Awards.
{\an8}#SnatchingTrophies.
{\an8}Working in your current pairs,
you'll be the presenters <i>and</i> nominees.
You'll need to come up with funny banter,
take jabs at your fellow nominees,
and if you win, you better have
an unforgettable acceptance speech.
{\an8}Jaidynn Diore Fierce and Kennedy
Davenport present "Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen."
{\an8}"Most Busted Queen,"
presented by Pearl and Max.
{\an8}"The Shadiest Queen," presented by
Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
{\an8}And, my favorite, "The Meatiest Tuck,"
presented by Violet Chachki and Miss Fame.
{\an8}Kasha Davis and Katya, you won the
Mini-Challenge, you're our Despy co-hosts.
{\an8}Now, to help you punch up your material,
Kathy Griffin is back.
-Yes, girl!
-Gentlemen,
start your engines
and may the best woman win.
So, Meatiest Tuck. Let's talk about that.
{\an8}Miss Fame and I sit down and start writing
jokes and neither of us are comedy queens.
[music]
With Pearl, the only thing showing
outward emotion is between her legs.
-What do you think is funny?
-I don't know.
We're both drawing a blank. You're looking
at me looking at the paper.
-The words escape me.
-My ideas are
somewhat decent, and you're like, "No."
If you think it's funny then
present it in a comical way.
{\an8}Fame and Violet, neither one of them have
really shown a whole lot of comedic value
in this competition yet. I'm interested to
see if they come up with any jokes at all.
This is stressing me out.
We've got to get it together.
I want to read everybody,
including ourselves.
{\an8}For this week's challenge, we all have to
present at an award show, The Despies.
We have to write jokes and we have to
present them live in front of an audience.
I want to win.
-So, what's our game plan?
-What you got?
You got anything?
{\an8}I know nothing about
award show stuff,
{\an8}but we're gonna sit down
and write us some jokes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to
present the Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen awards."
{\an8}I'm very confident in doing comedy.
-"And the nominees are..."
-No.
I mean, I won last week's challenge.
No. No. Uh-uh. Don't write it like that.
In that order, right here,
"Back to the nominee."
-We need a transition, then we can leave.
-Hush.
I know she's a little bit irritated.
Without saying,
I think she was saying, "Oh, I wish
I was with somebody funnier."
Okay, well, I guess I'm gonna be quiet.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi.
-Are you getting excited for the Despies?
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, girls.
-Hello, darling.
You all are opening the show,
so there's extra pressure.
-Yes.
-But you've hosted shows before.
-Yes
-Who are you patterning your banter after?
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
hosting the Golden Globes was...
-...perfection.
-Perfection.
So, that is
what I have in my mind.
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis come up.
She says,"Who"?
-I'm educating this youngster.
-I'm not actually that young.
-But you're just...
-I'm just ignorant.
Well, listen, you kids
have a lot of work to do.
-We're looking at your big opening.
-No pressure.
-No.
-Alright, thank you.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, Ru!
Have either of you done comedy before?
-Never.
-Do you two have banter prepared or...
What's your chemistry like?
You know what? We're two
very different people. Um...
I had to think about working with
somebody like her.
She's dark-sided.
-If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
-We're brainstorming right now
and seeing what we can play off, you know,
and make it funny and twist it in...
a dark-sided kind of way.
Being dark-sided is one thing but being
funny is a completely different thing.
Violet and Fame...
Oh, that's gonna be a laugh riot.
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Now, you're a show host, aren't you?
-Yes, I host several shows around Orlando.
-And you? Is comedy in your background?
-If a joke comes out when I'm tipsy,
it just comes out, but
I am not, like, a funny girl.
So how are you gonna make it funny?
She'll throw shade at me
and I'll throw shade at her and...
Well, I just want to tell you, ladies,
it's important to create a moment.
That's what stands out. Think about
when Sally Fields won her second Oscar,
you don't remember anything about that
ceremony except her saying, "You like me,
-You really like me."
-Mm-hmm.
So do something special.
-Hey, ladies.
-Hello, darling.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-So, what award are you presenting?
We'll present
"Most Busted Drag Queen."
That gives us an opportunity
to be a little bit more cutting.
Great, because this is about funny banter.
We're gonna go off a subtlety thing
like, speaking just very soft and gentle,
-but very cutty.
-That's not the easiest thing to pull off.
You have a big personality.
Pearl, you don't have a big personality.
How are you gonna
overcome that for this award?
Um, I think that I have
a great personality, actually.
Pearl, I'm twisting your tits here
because you were in the bottom last week.
-Right.
-And I want to make sure
that this week you up the ante.
You kind of told me I had no personality.
That doesn't give me confidence.
Well, I'm hoping it will
light a fire under your ass.
Is there something on my face?
No, I'm just not convinced
and I want you to do well.
That's why I brought your ass here.
{\an8}It's so...
{\an8}...intense.
I never want to see any of my girls
not live up to their potential.
-This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
-Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Yeah.
All right.
I will see you all later.
Thank you, Ru.
I feel very uncomfortable right now.
{\an8}I'm, like, tripping. I don't know what...
{\an8}...to do.
-I'm over this bullshit.
-We're finishing writing.
We'll make it great.
Impress Kathy.
I, like, need a minute.
Pearl walked out of the workroom.
I'm not sure she's coming back at all.
{\an8}There was a standoff between Ru and Pearl.
She ended up walking out.
I'm scared that she's not coming back,
'cause this is a co-presenter team thing.
So..."But enough about us,
we want to thank you, the audience."
{\an8}Kasha and I are doing our routines.
Now, we're at the point of editing.
{\an8}I look back and Pearl's still not there.
And I'm like, "What the hell is going on"?
How are you feeling?
Pearl feels defeated. I'm like, "Shit!
That energy can't be in this situation."
<i>I'm hoping that we're</i>
<i>just gonna be able to shake this off.</i>
She knows that if she doesn't
do well tomorrow, she will probably...
...be saying good-bye.
-Hi! [laughing].
-Hello!
{\an8}Kasha and I are getting feedback
with the comedy coach, Kathy Griffin.
It's so great to meet you and see you.
I'm pretty sure we'll
knock this one out of the park.
-All right, what you got?
-Enough about us. We wanna thank you--
Cut that line. Every award show says,
"Enough about us." Okay, go ahead.
"Ginger Minj, or as I call her, the
'Danny Devito of drag,' is in the house."
Danny Devito? That's, like, the least
gay reference I've ever heard in my life.
-It's just--
-Gay it up!
-Because she's, like, so--
-Gayer!
-More gay!
<i>-She's just like, "Nope!</i>
That's not good. Shorten that. Cut this.
Do this." So it throws me for a loop.
Then, we're going to intro to
the first presenters and that was it.
So, what did you have?
Just, "And the first presenters are..."?
{\an8}We're like, "Ugh! Back to
the drawing board."
-"Girl, you look nice tonight."
-"Girl, you look nice, girl."
-"Do you know what we look like?"
"Girl, what?"
-"The number 10."
-"Girl, you is a trip."
Okay, stop.
No more "girls." No more-- You're starting
every sentence with girl.
To me, it's like halfway there.
{\an8}Okay, girl.
"Due to her Craigslist ad, I thought
she was a pig bottom. Floss, anyone?"
Okay. I'm gonna stop you. It's a bit
too blue, and you're hearing that from me.
-So--
-What does that mean, "blue"?
Words that may be bleeped
would be considered blue humor.
The more you know.
"We're simply thrilled to be
looking down upon your oily faces."
"It's like a Nickelback concert mosh pit,
but with less class and more body odor."
Oh, God. All right, I love that
you're shady and fun and snarky.
Don't direct it at
the audience and the judges.
It turns into such a shade shit fest,
you just end up turning them off.
All right.
I think I just completely
changed your opening.
After this altercation, there's a lot of
pressure to deliver. We need to kill it.
-[both] "And the nominees are..."
-"A girl who puts the cunt in country..."
All right, that's a Rosanne Cash joke,
so just rewrite that one.
"Tonight, we are here to celebrate
the brightest stars in our industry."
"Unfortunately, none of them
were available."
It's like a couple of drag queens
throwing the same old shade at each other.
Give 'em something new.
[Ginger] <i>I used to think I was funny</i>
<i>until I met Kathy Griffin.</i>
{\an8}I'ma have to call my momma and
have her tell me how good I am.
Oh, girl.
{\an8}Next, we have to vote on the queen we want
to nominate for each category.
Whoever wins, you get a real sense
of what the other queens think of you.
{\an8}The Shadiest Queen? Violet is going
to take that one. By a landslide.
{\an8}Another glorious day.
{\an8}Today, we're getting ready for
the first annual Despy Awards.
I'm just happy to be nominated.
I'm feeling so much better today.
How about you?
I feel very good today, and thank you
for being so supportive and amazing.
I'm just gonna have fun with it
and do a good job and...
bow out gracefully if that's
what destiny has in store.
<i>Sometimes I do feel like</i>
<i>I am stuck in my shell.</i>
{\an8}The majority of my teen years
were spent really angry
and dealing with, like,
abandonment issues and...
I didn't know how to talk to people.
I know that a lot of my issues
stem from that experience,
so, if I can learn here that
it's cool to open up more...
"Come out of your shell, Pearl."
It'll be a good thing in the end.
<i>[sings] Ooh, when I think about chicken</i>
<i>It makes me happy</i>
{\an8}Chickens are my favorite animal.
I grew up on a farm with lots of chickens
and my job was to raise them
to be beautiful and flawless for the fair.
You can blow-dry them
and use vitamin E on their feet.
Liquid bluing makes
a white chicken sparkle.
You show the judge its asshole
and then they say, "Your bird's healthy."
When I was a kid, I used to go outside
and sing random songs to my chickens.
-What?
-I'd get into it, like, "They love it."
Bitch, this visual you just gave me,
you in a barn, covered in hay.
I hatched chickens under
my bed in an incubator.
This chicken actually won me an award,
right here. Animals were my best friends.
Imagine me about 30 pounds heavier
and a big nerd and loving chickens.
[clucking]
That's how I talk to chickens.
I feel good about us, Fame. It's good
we're getting to know each other.
Working with you has been such a pleasure.
I can't wait...
until I outshine you.
Violet, shut your hole.
{\an8}I can see how Fame thinks I'm a dark witch
or whatever, but I really like Miss Fame.
Today, I'm starting to really see
a change in Violet for the better.
It's nice. I'm probably one of the only
people she considers a friend right now,
and she does need a friend.

Please, welcome to the stage
the stars of Tyler Perry's Roots,
Kennedy Davenport and
Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
{\an8}Hello, everyone. Straight from
Kunta Kinte's Hut...
...the hourglass and the wall clock.
-Hold on, who's the wall clock?
-Step over there.
-Okay.
-Do this.
-Okay.
-My point.
Anyways, we are here
to present this award
-for the "Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen".
-Let us announce these awful nominees.
-Kandy... [sings] Ho.
-We all know how she got that last name.
-In the back alley, honey.
-Whore.
-Miss Fame.
-Oh, the brand.
Since when did the dollar store
become a brand?
[laughter]
-And Max.
-The queen from that movie <i>Powder</i>?
-Girl.
-The winner is...
Miss Fame.
{\an8}I wish I could cry but goddamn Botox
got me every time.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Thank you to Mexico for the tapeworm
that snatched my body. The man upstairs,
{\an8}thank you so much for the light.
I look great.
Thank you so much.
<i>Next up, Pearl and Max.</i>
{\an8}It is a true honor to be presenting the
Despy award for "Most Busted Drag Queen."
What is a busted drag queen?
I'm glad you asked.
Oh, yes. The nominees are, Mrs. Potato--
I mean, Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Miss Ginger Minj.  "Girl."
"After we swing on by gatorland,
we can get on back to my apartment
and swing on my husband."
The Brooke Hogan of drag, Katya.
And last, but certainly not youngest,
Mrs. Kasha Davis.
Did you hear that, dear?
And the winner is...
-[both] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-Oh, congratulations.
{\an8}Thank you to all my fellow
horrible drag queens.
{\an8}I hope you all burn in hell.
{\an8}And I mean it.
{\an8}-[award show exit music]
<i>-Next up, Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.</i>
I am so honored to be here
at the first annual Despy Awards.
And I'm working off community service.
We've gathered the very best to present
the award for the "Shadiest Shade."
Condragulations, Kandy! Oh,
I think it's high time that your beard
gets the public recognition it deserves.
No, Ginger. This award is for knowing
how to throw the shade and not apply it.
[both] And the nominees are...
The girl who puts the fun
in elephant, Ginger Minj.
The... how do I say this
and remain socially responsible?
"Black horse" of the competition,
Kennedy Davenport.
And last, as usual, Violet Chachki.
And the award goes to...
[drum roll]
...Violet Chachki.
{\an8}You don't like me.
You really don't like me.
{\an8}And last, but not least, God, thanks.
{\an8}<i>Next up, Miss Fame</i>
<i>and Violet Chachki.</i>
Are there any married couples in
the house? Michelle Visage, how long?
-17 years.
-Oh, girl, no. How long?
As someone who is highly experienced
with handling meat,
I cannot wait to hear the nominees
 for Meatiest Tuck.
-Oh, so you work in meat packing?
-You could say that.
Well, let's go ahead
and receive the nominees.
Katya. V.I.P. Very impressive package.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce. "Hey, girl."
-Meatiest Tuck? Girl, let's be honest.
It looks like she smuggled
a honey baked ham in her panties.
-That brings us to our last nominee.
-[both] Pearl.
Pearl's tucking ability
is just like her personality.
Semi-precious, exhausted,
and barely there.
[both] And the Despy Award goes to...
[both] Katya.
{\an8}I believe it was the great
American painter Bob Ross who said
{\an8}"The key to a swollen vagina is...
courage."
-Have a good night. Thank you so much.
-Good night.
Welcome, ladies. First, I want to
remind you being nominated is an honor,
but winning is so much better.
Thank you, Television Critics Association.
Now, based on your Despy presentations,
I've made some decisions.
Max and Pearl...
Condragulations. You're the winners
of this week's challenge.
You've each won a custom jewel package
from Fierce Drag Jewels.
{\an8}Completely unexpected and
I am on top of the moon. See?
-Thank you, darling.
-RuPaul, I got the smack down yesterday.
-And it worked.
-Yes, it worked. Thank you.
-I appreciate you.
-Thank you.
Kennedy Davenport and
Jaidynn Diore Fierce... you are safe.
-Thank you, Ru.
-You may leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
-First up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-You look gorgeous.
But you need to take it way over the top.
I see nothing over-the-top about you.
That's a hard job, opening the show.
That's tough, you know, to be
overshadowed by the people following you.
-Next up, Katya.
-You guys struggled in the opening a bit,
but when you accepted your award,
I thought you were so funny.
For your look, I just want
a little bit more volume on your hair.
Are you kidding me? This is from
the Brooke Hogan collection.
Get out your rat-tail, and start teasing.
Give us some kind of volume.
-Okay.
-Thank you, New Jersey's Michelle Visage.
Thank you.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
Your performance, you had, like,
an <i>All About Eve</i>, Nomi Malone in <i>Showgirls</i>
on the stairs moment where
you were like, "Get out of my way.
-This is my moment," which was fun to see.
-You should cut back on your black spray.
-My felt forehead?
-Just cut it back a little bit, girl.
Next up, Kandy Ho.
You look like Natalie Wood, but
this dress is not my favorite thing.
I think it's, like, swallowing you up
in not a good way.
Unfortunately, you were
paired with Ginger,
so it's up to you to up your game to
keep up with her, and she stole the show.
Thank you, Kandy.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
You look so fabulous. I look at you and
I go, "That's a modern queen." So refined.
In your performance, you have a tendency
 to speed up. You speed up in this way.
-Totally.
-Let us hear it, so we can actually laugh.
-Why did they vote you shadiest queen?
-There is some truth to it.
My guess is that you spend a lot of time
by yourself reading fashion magazines.
I look at fashion all the time.
Obviously, the Internet happened, Ru.
-Did you hear about it?
-Oh.
[Michelle laughing]
-All right, thanks, Violet.
-Thank you.
Next up, Miss Fame.
The short sleeve turtleneck with the
opera length glove just makes me so happy.
Your performance with Violet, it was
low-energy for me and didn't really hit.
But I think there's a funniness about you.
You give me a modern thing about comedy.
I can really see you consciously trying
to show us more than just beauty.
I'm just wanting to get past my own head.
How is your head?
I'm thinking a lot and I know
you guys can see that.
I don't even know how to
turn off my thinker.
-Hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Okay.
Thank you, Miss Fame.
All right, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
[engine revs up]
Just between us gladiators.
What do you think?
Starting with Kasha Davis.
Here's someone who has the chops and
didn't bring it tonight. Very frustrating.
This is like a workhorse queen, you know,
and a workhorse queen has to
make us laugh the minute we see her.
-It didn't happen tonight.
-I could be wrong. Maybe she's hilarious.
-No.
-Katya.
Katya's acceptance speech
was a great moment.
She wasn't that funny as the show opened
so I was so happy she had that moment.
As a long-time fan of the show,
what I love are the layers of irony,
and with Katya, there is a core of irony.
-Kandy Ho.
-She would've been gone without the blue.
-Ginger ate her up.
-Kandy Ho is fading away for me.
-Ginger Minj.
-Well, I thought Ginger was a powerhouse.
Don't you think, because her partner
didn't get any of the punchlines,
-is she responsible at all for that?
-No.
That's showbiz, kid. Sometimes, you got to
elbow your way to the front of the stage.
Well, remind me never to perform
on the same stage as Ross, okay?
-Miss Fame.
-I think there was a little stumbling
but she picked herself back up.
Looking at her just makes me live,
die, and then come back to life.
So fresh for a queen to look like that
and then be like this honest, goofy kid.
-Yeah.
-Violet Chachki.
I noted the jokes
about her today from the other queens.
-I don't think they like her very much.
-She doesn't get on well with the others.
She is a child of the Internet.
That is something you do alone.
Frankly, she wasn't necessarily
funny and it was a let down.
Come on, her acceptance speech
was hilarious. Excuse me,
who doesn't want to be the
shadiest queen? I mean...
how punk rock is that?
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my... girls?
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Ginger Minj...
you're safe.
Kandy Ho... tonight
you looked like Natalie Wood,
but your delivery was a little wooden.
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
Miss Fame...
you're safe.
Katya... you're safe.
Violet Chachki... your jokes
got lost in the shade.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, your big opening
was a little sloppy.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki... you're safe.
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come.
I want you to lip-synch...
for your life!

[Trixie] Pearl, did your life
flash before your eyes?
Yeah, you thought you were going home.
I don't know, it's crazy.
Usually I have a blast when I'm in drag.
But it was all about me walking
with my eyes half closed.
I thought I had bedroom eyes.

[laughter]
[Trixie and Katya] We're singing!
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hi.
You know in showbiz,
one day you're in on the joke,
and the next day,
the joke is on you.
So for this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be creating music video parodies
of one of my favorite artists ever!
-Me.
-[laughter, cheering]
[screams]
Working in three teams, you'll have to
write lyrics, record vocals,
{\an8}and then shoot your own
#PunnyOrDie music video.
{\an8}I feel really good about this challenge.
I can sing, and comedy is what I do.
Now, to mix things up, I'm gonna leave it
up to you to divide yourselves into teams.
All right, go for it, now.
[chatter]
Honey, I am a singer,
so I get boom, boom, boom.
-Are we a team?
-Three people cling to me for dear life.
I want you on my team.
I go right to Katya because she's funny.
I look right at Fame because she can sing.
And I love Pearl, so that was our group.
-Well, I guess that leaves us three.
-Here, let's do it. Let's just do it.
Yay.
{\an8}I've already been picked last
for teams twice, so who the fuck cares?
Now, for this challenge,
you really need to straddle the world
of music... and comedy.
[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[Violet] Let's get to work.
I think this challenge is complicated.
We have to come up with new lyrics
{\an8}to "Sissy That Walk" and then come up
with a music video. The pressure is on.
What if it's like, "Your face like chalk,"
and do really bad makeup or something?
[Violet] I mean, that's, like,
the obvious thing.
We can probably come up with better.
Hm.
{\an8}Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of, uh...
{\an8}...bitchy.
[Violet] We have to get
these lyrics really funny...
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.
"I don't want to be raunchy or dirty."
Are you fucking kidding me?
-Okay.
-We get "Dance With U."
I'm pretty confident that we can
make it into a funny parody.
I want to do
"I Want to Tan With You."
Let's think of a couple more options.
Well, maybe two more.
We could make it about raunchy,
dirty sex because that always is funny.
♪ Take my hand
I wanna touch your cock ♪
[Pearl] No, it's gonna be gross.
Give us a better concept
so we don't have to worry about that.
Well it shouldn't fall
on my shoulders just because...
-No, I get it, but, like--
-Thank you.
Pearl has really been falling short.
It's frustrating, because I'm on a team
with you. We have to pull each other up
or else your friends are going home.
[Miss Fame] We need to come up with
something. We're running out of time.
-Let's just do fucking tan with you.
-[Miss Fame] Okay.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hello.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-[all] Hi.
-I am very excited about this challenge.
-[all] We are too.
-Do any of you do parodies in your act?
-Rihanna's song. I turned it into "Suh,
burb and, and, and".
A little suburban gal number.
Ah.
Now, Kennedy, you were
in the bottom two last week.
Has that lit a fire under your tuchus?
-Oh, it definitely has.
-I have to tell all of you.
As the competition shrinks,
it gets stronger.
I'm expecting you all to deliver.
I had a shitty last challenge,
and Ru is expecting big things.
I have to shake it off
and keep my head in the game.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, RuPaul.
So are you fans of song parodies?
If they're clever. Sometimes they get
a bit raunchy and vulgar for me, but...
-Well, don't compromise your Christianity.
-No, Ma'am. [laughs]
-So, what song are you working on?
-"Sissy That Walk".
We want it to be a tie-in
to the top three from last season.
-What became of "Sissy That Walk"?
-"Get Ready to Clock."
Uh-huh.
Well, I cannot wait to see
what you have to offer,
-because I'm expecting a lot from you.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Hello.
-Hi, Ru.
I feel like Trixie is the leader
because I know you do a lot of comedy.
Turns out making fun of you
is a lot easier than I thought.
[RuPaul laughs]
She definitely thought of the concept.
-[RuPaul] What is the concept?
-[Pearl] "Tan With You."
-Four ladies who just love the sun.
-Overcooked, overgrown orangutans.
I love that. That sounds fun.
So now, with lyrics...
Are any of you lyricists?
We're comfortable to say,
"Not funny. We're not doing that."
I know, it's been
a little bit harsh over here.
Who is the most harsh?
All right.
Pearl and Fame are butting heads.
This is not a good sign.
{\an8}-Hi, season seven queens.
-[all] Yes.
{\an8}For today's maxi challenge,
we have to do a parody music video.
{\an8}Our team is working with the talented
Lucian Piane, RuPaul's producer.
-So we'll start with--
-[violently clears throat]
-Katya?
-Huh?
-Have you ever been recorded before?
-Yeah, once before, and it was a disaster.

Chicago before she moved to New York.

No, we're coming back up from that.

I thought, just record my phone thing

Just stay in and model.
If you're not singing, just ham it up.
Motherfucker.
Okay, you have some group choreography,
let's see that.
We also wanted to do a shot
where we're low to the ground.
After we do the group choreography,
let's get on the ground.
[Katya] Let's get props.
-[Trixie] Let's do it on the ground.
-When the time comes...
-Tick tock, time is ticking.

RuPaul and Michelle are going to think
we're a bunch of disorganized fuck-tards.
{\an8}-Let's work it out.
-All right, let's do it.
{\an8}Today we're getting ready for our
all green Eleganza runway.
Everybody's just anxiously waiting to see
how it all turns out on the main stage.
Girl, I see all these pictures over here
with Sahara. How do you know her?
-Well, Sahara's my sister.
-Oh, "Davenport," duh. [laughs]
[chuckles] Yeah.
This was when we first
started coming out together.
{\an8}Me and my sister, Sahara Davenport,
we met in high school,
and we shared a lot of
the same dreams.
[Kasha] Was it a big shocker
when she passed?
[Kennedy] Indeed it was. We just knew she
was in the hospital. Then she passed.
That was most heartbreaking for me
because I'm way in Dallas.
I had no money to go
to the funeral or anything, so...
-Isn't it the worst feeling in the world?
-That was, like, the worst.
That was my sister for real. If we'd come
out the same pussy, we would have.
Talking about Sahara, it feels good
to know that her legacy is still alive.
It's not just about me.
My family motivated me
to stay in this race.

at logotv.com.
Ladies, I've made some decisions.
[RuPaul] When I call your name,
please step forward.
Katya.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Kennedy Davenport.
This week, each of you emerged
as the star of your group.
Oh.
But one of you really made a mockery
of everything I hold sacred.
Kennedy Davenport. Condragulations, you
are the winner of this week's challenge.
Oh, my God.
<i>You will receive a three year supply</i>
<i>of essential family products</i>
-from the Honest Company.
-They smell really good.
Thank you so much.
Miss Fame and Ginger Minj,
you're both safe.
Thank you.
The five of you may leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Pearl.
About your character
in the "Tan With You" video,
you have to loosen it up, girl.
Come out of your shell.
We want more vitality and more energy
and more star power.
Are you a stoner, girl?
'Cause that's, like, the vibe I got.
There's plenty of girls here that take
their time "Coming out of their shell,"
but I feel picked on, almost.
-[RuPaul] All right, thanks, Pearl.
-Thank you.
Moving on. Trixie Mattel.
The idea of "Tan With You" is funny.
Were there big, butt-gusting,
knee-slapping, LOLs? No, but I liked it.
You are not standing out for me,
and I want to see some identity and some
flavor. I'm not getting that from you yet.
If you're gonna be the Comedy Queen,
you have to go all the way.
Don't let anyone else stand out.
You have to.
Next up, Max.
I do enjoy the look tonight.
I wish it was all green.
-It's a hint of green, really.
-Okay.
And I'm going to challenge you
to give us a look without gray hair.
All right.
I know there's not a lot of green, but I
just think it's so creative and so cool.
-Thank you.
-You were the weakest in your group.
Courtney Act is not easy to do.
She's not a big personality,
but I felt like you could have done more.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
Your tushy is so phenomenal.
It's just perfection.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-It's so good.
Your Adore was quite good, too.
You could have done more besides
just the stomping and the open mouth,
-but again, more bigger. Now is your time.
-Right.
Thank you very much.
Next up, Kandy Ho.
<i>Hola.</i>
If you look around,
everyone has looks, concepts,
and I don't think
a pretty dress is enough.
You were on a team with three other
really big personalities,
and I wanted you to stand out even more.
You got lost in that challenge.
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
You walked out in that outfit,
and I love a <i>schticky</i> queen,
and it's a great twist
on the green theme.
[Michelle] So let's talk about the video,
this kind of sing-talk thing that you do.
{\an8}♪ <i>Oh, the wig</i> ♪
You don't think you can sing,
is that where we're going?
What happened was, I think Bea Arthur
was inside me when we were recording,
and I was like, "There's the voice today."
We have something in common.
Bea Arthur was once inside me as well.
-Wow.
-[laughter]
All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
All right, just between you, me, and these
fierce drag jewels I'm wearing...
[laughter]
What do you think? Pearl.
She just kind of feels lazy.
And it's like, don't be lazy.
This is it.
I feel like it's nervousness.
-What would you tell her?
-Get your head out of your ass.
Work it out.
Trixie Mattel.
She says she is campy and dresses like it,
but I've not seen the personality yet.
I didn't really understand who Trixie was.
She was lost in the video.
I've seen many audition tapes, and hers
was one of the funniest I've ever seen,
but Trixie has yet to emerge as Trixie.
-[RuPaul] Max.
-You can tell how creative she is,
and you have to be intelligent
to be that creative.
I was a little underwhelmed
by this characterization.
She was worried more about being
the best Courtney Act she could be...
...instead of being
the drag version of Courtney Act.
Violet. Here's a queen who has studied.
She's really smart and 22 years old.
-Oh, I want to suck the life out of her.
-[laughter]
It's funny, because Violet
in the studio struggled a little bit
and then I saw the video and I was,
"Oh, my gosh, that's Adore."
I think she could have gone further
in the video, a little more over-the-top.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
-She didn't stand out in the video,
{\an8}but she did a great job with the ad-libs.
That is what impressed me the most.
-Yes.
-But standing next to these other queens,
personally, it wasn't enough.
It seems like she's
really channeling glamour
and that's kind of it.
[RuPaul] All right, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
She did, kind of, blend in
a little bit too much in the video.
I don't know. I love her,
because she harkens back to
a different sort of age of drag to me,
-and as much...
-Why were you looking at me?
[Michelle screams]
-No, I specifically didn't.
-[laughter]
Silence. I've made my decision.
[whispering] Bring back my girls.
-What?
-[shouting] Bring back my girls!
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Violet Chachki...
...you're safe.
[RuPaul] Max...
...you're safe.
Mrs. Kasha Davis...
-...you're safe.
-Thank you.
Pearl,
you are a magical queen, but your
performance failed to charm the judges.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
{\an8}I felt really good about this challenge,
but who the fuck knows anymore?
Trixie Mattel, you went
for the comedy gold,
but all we got was bronze.
Kandy Ho,
your video performance wasn't sticky,
and your runway look was not so sweet.
Kandy Ho...
-...you're safe.
-Thank you.
Trixie, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
-from elimination.
-[dramatic music]
The time has come...
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life.

<i>I love Pearl, but I'm in it to win it.</i>

-You're the winner of this challenge.
-Thanks.
-Pearl.
-I didn't realize you're the good Divine.
[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
As an actress, you don't have to say:
"Look at me, I'm bad." [growls]
It should come naturally.
Who deserves to go home tonight and why?
-[RuPaul] Fame.
-[Pearl] Fame.
-[Ginger] Fame.
-Fame.
Trixie got to come back so she should be
looked at with a magnifying lens.
There's a part of Pearl

{\an8}Oh, I'm gonna miss her so much.
{\an8}With that being said,
take that shit off the mirror.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Fame probably felt really attacked,
because she was nice to everyone.
{\an8}Everyone is throwing her under the bus.
It sucks.
{\an8}Fame was really trying.
There are less deserving queens here.
-So congratulations, winner.
-Thank you.
Of all challenges to win,
that's fucking awesome.
[Ginger] Girl, how about Fame
throwing you under the bus?
I didn't expect that at all.
{\an8}"Pearl knows what I'm talking about."
It's like: "No, I don't."
But her calling me out
gave me an extra kick in the ass
to floor the bitch in the lip-sync.
It was really, like, such a close call.
I really could have been lip-syncing.
{\an8}Violet should be very, very grateful
{\an8}that her Lisa Frank couture kept her from
 being in the bottom two this week,
because her performance was abysmal.
Even if it kills me, I'll fucking come out
on top the next challenge.
{\an8}Violet's strengths are her runway
but at this point in the competition
you have to be versatile.
If you only have one strength...

-You're all getting free cosmetic surgery.
-[Pearl] Ooh.
But you'll be doing it yourselves.
Sorry about that.
For today's mini challenge, you'll serve
some rich bitch reality realness.
Using clear plastic tape,
you need to nip and tuck your mugs
to plastic perfection.
And then you'll be shooting a stiff
and unnatural title sequence
{\an8}for my latest series,
<i>The Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Now, you've got 20 minutes,
so ready, set, let it rip!
-Bitch, I look fishy as fuck.
-[laughter]
Katya has built a forehead out of tape.
<i>She is serving Herman Munster realness.</i>
Kennedy looks like she usually looks.
Girl, did you put any tape on?
[RuPaul] All right, ladies, time's up!
Masterqueef Theater presents
<i>The Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Some people call me a slut
but I'm also an alcoholic.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
I'm not the best cookie in the cookie jar,
but at least I taste good.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
When times get tough,
I just breathe through my nose.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
The secret to success
is being God's favorite. Shh.
[RuPaul laughs]
How do I sleep at night? [laughs]
Ask your husband.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
What's the best part
about being married to a sociopath?
The constant threat
of danger keeps you so thin.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
Ladies, you've never looked so... unusual.
The winner of this week's
mini-challenge is...
Violet Chachki.
{\an8}The winner is Kelly Mantle!
[RuPaul] We'll be posting
these gifs at logotv.com.
-Now, are you ladies ready for more?
-Yeah.
For this week's maxi-challenge,
you must prance your padded asses off.
{\an8}#Prancingqueens.
In pairs, you'll dance to mash-ups
like the Tango Vogue, the Charleston Twerk
-and the Country Robot.
-[laughter]
And there's just one more little detail.
For the first time in <i>Drag Race</i> herstory
you'll be decked out
in half-man and half-queen drag.
Think Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde Your Can.
Violet, you won the mini-challenge,
so you get to assign the couples.
Now this bitch gets to pair up
the teams. [scoffs]
-First, pick your dance partner.
-Katya.
Sorry. No way, bitch. You're on your own.
Unless you can help me win a challenge.
-How about the other queens?
-They're already paired off.
I'm gonna do Ginger and Trixie.
[RuPaul] And you're pairing
Kennedy with Pearl.
[Katya] <i>So Violet chooses my partner,</i>
<i>Ginger.</i>
I'm a little frustrated because
I can sew and dance, and she can't.
Now, tomorrow you'll get into half drag
{\an8}using makeup provided
by Anastasia Beverly Hills.
Now, to win this challenge,
you'll need to apply the rhythm method.
Your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best half-woman win.
Yes!
-Do you know how to tango?
-No.
Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Jamie Lee Curtis.
It's, like, Spanish.
Violet and I are pairs for the first time,
and I'm not sure how this will go.
What's this? Okay, hold on.
Come back here! [chuckles]
{\an8}This week's maxi-challenge makes me
wanna slap somebody's mama.
We have got to do
a prancing with the queens ballroom dance
as half a man and half a woman.
What the hell?
-Do you not dance at all?
-[laughs] Heck, no, ma'am!
-Not even the truffle shuffle.
-Can you robot at all?
Is this good? Is this right?
When I say: "I don't dance",
I mean: "I don't dance!"
-We could do the electric slide.
-What is that?
I mean, that's for the win.
-Hello, hello, hello!
-Hi!
-How are my prancing queens?
-Fabulous.
-Hey, Kennedy. Hey, Pearl.
-Hey, Ru.
-Now, do you dance?
-It's been a while since class.
But I do have it in my spirit.
I love it. I love it.
Pearl, are you good with choreography?
-Mm-hmm.
-I think you just answered that one.
Well, this is a great opportunity for you
to go outside of what you normally do,
'cause I want to see that.
[Kennedy] <i>Pearl can't dance.</i>
{\an8}Choreographed dance and dancing
in the club are two different things.
I hope her personality shines through
and she just plays it out.
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi!
-Trixie, back together again!
-Ginger and Trixie, the sequel.
-I like to call it "the revenge".
-Oh!
What's the hardest part of this challenge?
What are you not looking forward to?
-We'll do it live.
-Mm-hmm.
So I think the pressure of that,
with me not being a dancer,
that's the one part
that keeps playing over in my head.
Yeah. What are you most worried about?
I hate to say
I got outshined by Ginger last week.
I'm not trying to have it happen again.
Okay.
-All right, well, get back to work.
-Thank you.
-Hey, ladies!
-Hi, Ru!
-Now, Violet, do you dance at all?
-I actually... I'm an aerial performer.
If I recall right, in the last challenge,
you had problems with rhythm and timing.
-I did.
-How will you work through that?
Own it, work through it.
I'll turn it out.
Those are famous last words around here.
I already said 'em once, I'm still here.
Yeah? Well, okay. All right.
{\an8}Violet is sexy as hell,
but she has to bring something else.
[RuPaul] Ladies, gather round!
Soon you'll rehearse with Kym Johnson
from <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.
And...
our very own Carson Kressley.
So, ladies, good luck and...
five, six, seven, eight,
don't fuck it up.
All right!
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha,
cha-cha-cha, to me.
And...
-And good, we have visitors.
-Oh, hello!
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!
{\an8}So today I brought my really fantastic,
amazingly talented friend Kym Johnson.
{\an8}She taught me on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.
She's brought great assistants today.
-You're doing the Charleston Twerk?
-Yes.
-Then let's get started with the routine.
-Let's do it.
And so with tricks and stuff,
can you do the splits?
-I can split, flip.
-Can I see it?
-[Pearl] Oh, my God!
-[Kym] Give it to me.
Whoo! Oh! Amazing!
-Yes, Kennedy.
-[Kym] Oh, my goodness!
-You can't do that?
-No.
I'm not gonna dwell on the fact that
{\an8}Kennedy does a back handspring double axel
with a twist landing into a split
and I can't. I'll give them the energy
they've been asking for over and over.
-Grab ahold of his waist.
-Like this?
-Child's play!
-Walk it through.
-Try to keep your core really tight.
-[Pearl] Okay.
[Kym] In.
-[Carson] Pearl...
-[Kym] Yes.
-[Carson] <i>A little gangly.</i>
-Yes, she has to straighten those legs.
Her legs bent up in the air like that,
they weren't so attractive.
-Good luck with that.
-Mm-hmm.
-Pearl, have you twerked before?
-Never. [laughs]
-Never?
-If you can't twerk, shake your legs.
-Yeah.
-Like this?
Can we bring Ambrose out to show him?
-You wanna go hop, hop.
-See how cool that looks?
-No problem.
-Can you do that?
-Pop, pop, pop, pop.
-[Kym laughs]
Yeah, no, not so much.
As far as the choreography,
it's the technique that's lacking, so...
We got work to do, Miss Pearl.
-Hi!
-Hello!
{\an8}I feel really good going in with Katya.
We have a good grasp on the vibe
and the style so we're gonna work it out.
I'm going to need Ambrose to come in here.
He's the voguing expert.
One, two, three, four.
Open it up on five, six.
Touch your cheekbone, seven, eight.
Sharp to the front on one.
Three, four, five, six, and Madonna.
Seven, eight, one.
-Totally!
-[Katya laughs]
-[Kym] I know it seems simple but--
-No, we know it's not.
[Kym] Oh. [laughs]
We start the choreography and immediately,
I'm totally freaked out.
Okay, fuck! No, sorry.
-Yeah? Good?
-It's just...
It's a lot. It seems really complicated.
-Lunge, dip.
-Oh, shit, fuck.
-[Katya] Sorry.
-[Kym] No.
With choreography, I can get it,
if I have about three to four months.
So then we're gonna walk.
One, two, and flick. Good.
-[Katya] Okay.
-[Kym] Want to try together?
One, two, up and down.
So like you're hopping over something.
Ooh! Ooh!
Just hop over.
You'll get it. Left, flick.
But then... almost-ish.
Keep breathing, keep trying.
You're gonna get this.
Violet cannot get this goddamn leg flick.
It's just flick your fucking legs,
try to kick your butt, do-- [groans]
It's very frustrating.
-[Kym] Fast, fast, turn! Get down.
-[Carson] Yes!
-Come up. Come up!
-[Violet cries]
Face, face, face! Turn!
Up! Yep.
[Kym] Madonna, walk, walk!
Katya, is that terror or confusion
on your face?
It's a little bit of both.
It was just pandemonium.
This could really be a disaster,
or it could be absolutely incredible.
-[Carson] We have a medic. They'll be OK.
-[Kym laughs]
-You'll have your work cut out for you.
-Yeah, no shit.
-Hi.
-Hello!
{\an8}Our mash-up is country robot,
which is perfect
because this is like a kind of funny,
campy piece.
-So are you guys good dancers?
-No.
-I'm not.
-You look like you're worried.
Lord be with me!
You're gonna go bah, bah.
Keep your head to the front.
-Now, your head goes last.
-Oh, okay.
-Yes!
-[Kym] Yeah, how did that feel?
Terrible.
In the country we don't move like this.
We move nice and slow and fluid.
Slow being the key word.
And up, there, out, up. Feet together.
-[Kym] Almost. We'll get that.
-[Ginger] Hey, girl!
Ginger.
-How's it going?
-I'm okay.
-Yeah?
-I'm not in meltdown mode yet.
-I'm okay.
-Okay.
Let's try the country two-step.
One, two, three. One, two, three. Flick.
-Right, left, right, right, left, right.
-Good!
-Very nice.
-Very nice, then...
You're gonna jump off.
Oh, God!
-Put your left arm around her shoulder.
-[Ginger] Don't lean back.
[Trixie] I do yoga, I got it.
-I do frozen yogurt.
-[Kym laughs]
I look at Trixie like:
"I hope you've been working out, girl.
I'm a delicate flower. You're lifting me."
[Ginger] All right.
[Kym] One... oh, oh, oh!
No, no, no. Sorry.
Maybe a little more graceful.
-One, two, three--
-Ooh! I'm sorry.
-Ginger, is your insurance up to date?
-[laughter]
-Thanks, Obama.
-I won't drop her.
This is a chance for the judges to go:
"Trixie lifted Ginger. It was awesome."
So we jump one...
No matter what I do, I won't drop Ginger.
-[Kym] Oh, and arms...
-[Ginger] Aah!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Are you OK?
And then I dropped Ginger.
-Just rehearse like crazy.
-[Kym] Yeah.
We will, absolutely.
{\an8}[Pearl] Oh, just another day
in the workroom, girl.
{\an8}For this challenge, we have to dance
in pairs dressed as half man, half woman.
With only six of us, it's a one
in three chance you'll lip-sync.
So it's a different air in the room today.
-I did not sleep at all last night.
-Really?
No. I was literally up all night
doing the robot.
I have no clue what I'm doing, girl.
I'm like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Yeah. I'm not a dancer either.
It's all about selling it.
It'll be who performs their song best.
I'm just afraid I'm gonna look like
Honey Boo Boo meets Rosie O'Donnell.
{\an8}My biggest challenge with choreography
{\an8}is going to be selling it as a sexy woman.
[Ginger] <i>I don't see myself like that.</i>
I am trying to pull everything together,
because I don't want to go home
and I don't want to set Trixie up
for failure.
I'm exhausted.
I thought it'd be some cha-cha shit.
But this is like legit-ass choreo.
-Lifts and dips...
-Lifts and dips.
Running around. You know what?
-It's really a pleasure to work with you.
-Oh! [laughs]
{\an8}Violet is more likable than I thought.
I admire her confidence.
I'm ten years older than the bitch,
and I don't have that yet.
When you picked me, I thought:
"This will be interesting."
-And it's been so much fun.
-Yeah, I'm trying to be nice.
-[Ginger] Why start now, girl?
-[laughter]
{\an8}The old lady brigade is still kicking,
honey, and talking shit.

Oh, my gag. Amazing job, ladies.
Tonight, you're making our job
incredibly difficult.
That being said,
it's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Pearl.
Okay, Pearl, you're a good-looking man
and a good-looking woman.
You're like a bisexual's dream date.
The dancing,
you are a little rhythmically challenged.
The stiffness helped with the Charleston,
not so great with the twerking.
Fantastic. What you lacked in technique,
you made up for in enthusiasm.
-It's clear you were having a good time.
-Yeah.
-That speaks volumes.
-What was it like working with Kennedy?
Oh, my God, we're probably the two most,
kind of "flazay da" sort of like...
-The most what?
-"Flazay da" sort of...
Are you saying <i>laissez-faire</i>?
I think he's trying to say blasé
and add la-di-da on the end.
-But he said "flazay da."
-Yeah, a little "flazay da".
Well, I asked
because I have an Aunt Flazay Da.
-All right, thank you, Pearl.
-Thank you.
Next up, Kennedy Davenport.
For the dancing, a bit of the energy
was a little laid-back.
-I felt that it looked effortless.
-Thank you.
I love the wheelbarrow move.
That's how I got pregnant.
I had a great time watching.
-Next up, Trixie Mattel.
-Howdy, y'all.
Trixie, I think you definitely nailed
the runway look
and you kept true to Trixie with that
dangling bottom eyelash, so...
-It's a bit campy. Obviously.
[Trixie] -Yeah.
-Just a bit.
-Just a little.
Your dancing was technically strong.
Maybe not so much robot,
but you nailed the country.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
I loved the attempt to butch up
when you showed the guy side.
-I coached her. I coached her.
-And it shows.
The dancing this week,
it seemed off for you.
Not that you were bad, 'cause you weren't.
Um...
This was so hard for me.
I was at my full mental capacity
because it was so out of my comfort zone.
-Where are the emotions coming from?
-My biggest fear is dancing in public.
Because I feel people are going
to judge me poorly
for how I look and the way things jiggle.
I didn't know any of your insecurities
and you could not tell.
-You were absolutely magnificent.
-I second that.
We just see this beautiful,
talented person that's having a good time.
All right, thank you.
-Next up, Katya.
-I loved seeing you with this black hair.
We're used to seeing Katya
in red hair and blond hair.
We haven't gotten the black fantasy yet.
-Ooh, girl.
-Well, I've had it many a time,
-but not from you, Katya.
-When I saw you come out on the runway,
I was like: "Oh!" You were coquettish.
And then when you turned,
and I mean this as a compliment,
it was very, like, hot, douchey guy.
-That is amazing.
-All right, "V" is for Violet.
-You were an absolute work of art.
-Thank you.
You are so exquisite.
Like, I kind of want to be you.
-Am I weird?
-Have your baby first.
-Maybe I'm gonna name my baby after you.
-RuPaula Chachki.
[Alyssa] There you go, perfect.
Technically, your tango,
you had just the right tone for it.
On some extensions, you got really low.
It was very tango, congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you. While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us dance moms.
What the hell are we gonna do?
They were all good,
but we must choose the best and the worst.
We're gonna start with Pearl.
Of all of them,
Pearl made the hottest guy.
And she exuded confidence.
We usually see a zombie.
She's crossed over this line now
and she's really in the game.
I love that aloof attitude that she had.
Very "flazay da".
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-Did you get a look at her ass?
-[Michelle] Oh, yeah!
Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake.
Kennedy was shining tonight.
She clearly was the strength in the duo.
The dancing was the con.
I know you guys think it was very strong.
There wasn't enough razzle-dazzle for me.
-But I liked that it looked effortless.
-Really?
-She was on fire!
-She looked bored.
She was a great twerker,
but there wasn't much energy in her dance.
-[RuPaul] <i>Trixie Mattel.</i>
-I might be alone in this one
but I had a really good time with Trixie.
I don't have the same enthusiasm
that Michelle has for Trixie.
For me, honestly,
it just left me a little like "meh."
I didn't see that glint in her eye
of, like, "I really want this".
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-I think her look on the runway was okay.
-[Michelle] <i>The girl half wasn't exciting.</i>
-Let's discuss them as a pair.
I know you're in a difficult position
and you're splitting hairs, but...
watching that performance, it felt jokey.
It just wasn't my cup of tea.
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-She looked gorgeous on the runway
but her boy side was just kind of "meh."
-Blah.
-Katya's choreography was very correct.
When I said that she was hot,
douchey as the male,
it impressed me
that she was able to go that masculine.
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
-Tonight, her runway was the best for me.
-What artistry!
-[RuPaul] <i>It took my breath away.</i>
-[Michelle] <i>Yes.</i>
-She's a little bit like Bambi.
Very pretty, big eyes,
but when you ask her to move, it's like--
-Like Taylor Swift in heels.
-Yes.
But the tango's not an easy dance.
So for her to pull off what she did,
I think she did a great job.
Silence! I've made my decision.
I think.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your prancing and runways,
I've made some decisions.
And this week, I'm judging you in pairs.
Pearl and Kennedy Davenport,
we flipped for your flappers.
But were you one step
behind the competition?
Trixie Mattel and Ginger Minj
took us for a roll in the hey, girl, hey.
But was it a barn burner?
Katya and Violet Chachki.
You two make a striking pair.
But could this be your last tango?
Katya and Violet.
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
I'm so fucking happy! You fucking bitch!
Sorry. I'm sorry.
[RuPaul] You've each won an original gown
from Mountbatten Concepts
and a gift card from Klein Epstein Parker,
made-to-measure suits.
You may step to the back of the stage.
{\an8}Katya and I won, and I cannot believe it.
Actually, yeah, I can.
Pearl and Kennedy...
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Trixie and Ginger, I'm sorry,
my dears, but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}It is breaking my heart,
having to go against Trixie.
But as much as I love her,
I am here to win.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies,

The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...

Ginger Minj, shantay, you stay.
Thank you for seeing
something in me that...
makes you want me
to go a little bit further.
You may join the other girls.
Trixie Mattel,
you put the "try" in "country",

{\an8}I'm just over this bullshit.
We want to welcome... welcome you

{\an8}-I took out the two oldest ones.
-[laughter]
{\an8}Ru gave me another chance.
{\an8}So I'm just gonna have to go crazy,

So who is everybody

-I won!
-Me.
The award that was so unexpected
was Violet.
Shady lady!
How do you feel about winning that award?
-You know, I was kind of expecting it.
-[Miss Fame] Yeah, me too.
{\an8}People think I'm mean, but everything
I've done comes from humor or truth.
I want you to know that I am gonna work

I won't hold my breath.

-Well, congrats to Max and Pearl.
-[Ginger] Yes, congratulations!
Girl, how do you feel?
'Cause I know you were having a meltdown.
-No, I was not feeling it today.
-I could tell.
[Miss Fame] <i>I was not expecting</i>
<i>Pearl to pull through that strong.</i>
{\an8}I'm frustrated, I'm grateful to be here,
and she's like "Fuck this. I'm out."
The energy is so toxic. I can't

Looks like the Pit Crew invited

I'm gonna pass out.
[laughs]
{\an8}I'm taking in the buffet right now.
Every size and color.
It's like Epcot for the thirsty bitches.
For today's challenge, we're gonna play
a game called Monster in Your Pants.
[laughter]
Most of these men have a number tucked
inside their Justin Case underwear.
You call out a name, he reaches
into his drawers and whips it out.
You'll need to gobble up
as many points as possible.
But be careful, because one of you
bastards has a Monster in Your Pants.
If you pick the monster before you freeze
your points, you're out of the game.
All right, first up.
Come on over, Miss Fame.
[RuPaul]
The rest wait outside for your turn.
-Miss Fame, call out a name.
-I'm gonna go with Dick.
Everybody loves Dick. Ten!
-Ten points
-Yay! I'm gonna go with Jack.
-There it is.
-Joe.
-[buzzer]
-No!
Shoot!
-I'm gonna start with Fang.
-Nine!
We're off to a good start.
I think I'll go with Boo.

-[both] Oh!
Katya!
{\an8}I've no idea what the rules are.
I don't care what they are.
{\an8}Just, when do I get to blow them?
I can't say that?
{\an8}I can't say that either?
-Katya, call out a name.
-Okay.
-Dude.
-[RuPaul] Show us what you got.
Motherfucker! God. Son of a motherfucking

[RuPaul] The first time out?
I love me some BJ, but I'll go with Papi.

-Oh, no!

-Whip it out, Jack!
- Ooh, girl!
-I think I wanna freeze.
-You wanna freeze.

Pearl, this may be your chance
to finally get that necklace.
-Jack.
-Six and a half.
Fang.
-Nine!
-Yes!
-Who's talking to you?
-Pete.
Fuck you, Pete. Fuck you, Pete.
All right, time to get that blood
rushing right back up to your brains.
The one queen that inched
her way to victory is... Ginger Minj.
[cheers and applause]
{\an8}For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll act in the reenactment series
{\an8}#RuHollywoodStories.
{\an8}This week's episode,
Whatever Happened to Merle Ginsberg?
Y'all remember Merle? She sat
by my side for the first two seasons.
I could almost see her now.
So soft, so wise, so blurry.
In teams of three, you'll portray
Merle, myself, and Michelle Visage,
as you reenact our very different versions
of what ha-happened?
Ginger Minj, you won the mini challenge
so you get to pick your two teammates.
Kennedy Davenport and Katya.
And then you get to assign
the other two groups.
Max, Violet, and Kandy.
Ginger knows Violet and Kandy
have not been the strongest.
Regardless,
I am gonna whip 'em into shape.
And that means team three
is Miss Fame, Jaidynn, and Pearl.
God damn it, me and Pearl again.
I'm frustrated.
Now listen, I need you to break
this mystery wide open.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
You wanna roll through it so we get
the hang of it and don't mess up?
What if we were doing
like a three-way scissor?
Or like a triangle toenail clipping?
Or like a toenail polishing thing?
Okay.
{\an8}Pearl was having a good time.
"What if we did this?"
I'm like, "What if we learn our lines?"
What I would like to do,
just kind of start acting stuff out
so it gets in our brains and stuff.
I ain't trying to look a fool again and go
home 'cause you wanna do a stunt.
'Cause I just don't wanna bomb this,
'cause we gotta win.
We gotta have fun because there's nothing
to this but being completely nonsensical.
{\an8}For our maxi challenge this week,
we will reenact the Ru Hollywood Story of,
What the Hell Ever Happened
to Merle Ginsberg?
-Okay, so how do we feel about characters?
-I don't know.
{\an8}I'm a little bit over
these acting group challenges.
{\an8}I'm sick of memorizing lines and lyrics,
and working with other people.
I'm not really comfortable playing Ru.
-Do you want Merle?
-I was comfortable with Michelle.
-'Cause I could do the Jersey thing.
-The Merle--
That one's off for me
because I do not know nothing about her.
The attitude shouldn't be,
"I don't know how to do this,"
or "I'm uncomfortable with it."
They need to be positive and excited.
It's like...
Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere.
-Ru and I are great friends.
-Well, I'm her best friend, okay?
And I'm supposed to be a judge here.
You got it, Merly girl?
{\an8}Ginger is gonna be the evil villain,
which is perfect,
{\an8}because she's playing it
like Ginger Minj as Danny Devito
as Tony Soprano as The Fonz
as Michelle Visage.
Hey, Merle, how's my cake?
Don't you want sprinkles?
So I have to find a way
to not get overshadowed by Ginger.
-Hello, hello, hello!
-[all] Hi!
In a moment, you'll meet with Ross Mathews
who will be directing your Ru-enactments.
And tomorrow, for the runway,
category is... Death Becomes Her.
-Now a warning?!
-[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}-Ginger, Kennedy, Katya, how are you?
-[all] Good. Good.
-Who's gonna play RuPaul?
-Me.
-It's just a joke, honey.
-[laughter]
-I figured that out.
-[Kennedy] Right.
You're doing Merle's story.
-I'm ready.
-Okay, places!
-Action!
-Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere.
Ru and I are great friends.
Well, I'm her best friend, see?
Ru, I brought you a cake.
All the brothers will like-- I'm sorry.
It's all right, honey.
All the brothers will wanna eat this cake.
Speaking of,
I have to go speak to the new Pit Crew.
Cut!
That was a little rocky.
Kennedy's RuPaul
was the weirdest fucking thing ever.
You have job security
for the rest of your life!
That was like...
{\an8}I am just sending up
a silent prayer at this point
<i>that we do not get dragged down</i>
<i>into the bottom because of her.</i>
-Hello, team two.
-Hello.
-Hi, Ross.
-Places!
Okay, ready.
-Max, this is how you see Merle?
-It's not how I see Merle.
-But it's Michelle's side of the story.
-So thought behind this performance.
-Oh, of course.
-Yeah, you are the Meryl Streep of drag.
-Action.
-You can have my job, tramp!
Because I'm taking RuPaul's!
What?!
Um, let's cut. So on your, "What?"
you should be like, "What?"
Upset about it, grab your drink,
take a sip to calm yourself down.
-Okay.
-[Ross] Right?
I'm supposed to hold a cake and a drink
while I do all of this?
No one said it was easy.
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!
Mother--
-Can I get my line?
-Mother does not play that.
-Mother does not play!
-That.
-Oh, play that.
-Play that.
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!
Mother does not play!
-That.
-Fuck.
Let's do it again.
Shit.
-Look at you.
-Hi, Ross Mathews.
-Your scene today is RuPaul's story.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.
-So a lot rests on your shoulders.
-I know.
Okay, let's get in positions.
Action.
You two are crazy!
I forgot my line!
{\an8}I got frustrated.
And then next thing you know...
Get the crazy one and...
I'm just forgetting all my lines.
RuPaul, my monkeys
made you this potato salad.
Yay, I love a strong--
I don't know the line.
Yay, I love emotional time travel movies
with a strong female lead.
Yay, I love a strong female lead.
I love a--
I'm so struggling right now, to be honest.
-What's the struggle?
-This is the toughest day I've had.
I like to be professional,
and this is just embarrassing for me.
-I hear you.
-I  want to do better than this.
And I'm hitting a wall.
I wanna talk real, I'm in a room of people
and this is a chance of a lifetime.
And I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.
{\an8}Miss Fame decides to stop everything.
Just say the fucking line!
I have not been to this place before
so I'm trying to...
-It's fine. Just be funny.
-I don't know what's better.
Should I not talk about my feelings
or should I just keep moving on?
Oh, my god. I feel like I'm dating you.
[Ross laughs]
-We'll talk later.
-We just gotta get through this scene.
{\an8}I don't want to disappoint
anybody that's believed in me.
I don't want to make RuPaul disappointed
that I'm here because I'm not producing,
'cause I care a lot about my success.
{\an8}-Let's do it. Let's do it, do it, do it.
-[Pearl] Let's get this party started.
{\an8}Our runway look is Death Becomes Her.
How would your drag character die?
Girl, that is open to interpretation.
I want to see what these bitches pull out.
{\an8}For my Death Becomes Her look,
I'm going to be--
{\an8}Gee, I don't know what I'm gonna be.
Maybe burned and...
I kind of morphosize into a glamazon,
but before that,
it's, like, a night of hooking.
[laughs]
Katya, how did your family feel
about doing drag?
They're amazing. I never had
to worry about it or feel self-conscious.
-Girl, I wish my mama would be like that.
-What's she like, Jaidynn?
Me and my mama are, like, best friends.
-But it's just kind of hard because--
-Of the drag?
Not really the drag thing.
It's just sexuality.
{\an8}I have not officially
come out to my family yet.
We just kind of ignore the issue.
They're okay with the drag,
but not with the gay?
They're not really okay with the drag.
They know I do it.
My mom kind of lets me know,
"No, you ain't going in that direction."
She'll send me a text like, "I'm grateful
that one day you'll find you a wife."
It's hard because I love my family,
and my biggest fear is being disowned.
-Yeah.
-[Violet] And that's a real fear.
-It's, like, a serious fear.
-[Jaidynn] Yeah.
I think it may change my relationship
with my brothers, my mom,
and that's what I'm scared of most.
And that's the reason why I just...
stay to myself.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to live without my family.
I love my family too much.
-You know what I'm saying?
-Totally.
It's just crazy to not be able
to be your authentic self.
Even in your home.
And it's either,
I'll just live my life and marry a woman
and do what my family wants me to do
and be unhappy, or I can do me.
-So it's one of the two.
-Well then, do you and be happy.
[sighs] It's just a complicated thing.
In the end,
I just want to be accepted for who I am.
And I want people to know
that gay is okay. [sighs]

Ladies, let's watch my favorite new show,
Ru Hollywood Stories.
First up, Merle's story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
I'm Merle Ginsberg, and this is my story.
{\an8}[Merle] <i>I was at the craft service table</i>
<i>getting my morning martini,</i>
<i>and I spotted RuPaul and said,</i>
<i>"Hey, Rusy-Q,</i>
<i>I'm so glad to be back for Season 3."</i>
And RuPaul said, "Oh, Merly girl,
I could never do the show without you."
You have job security
for the rest of your life.
Little did I know that we were not alone.
[clears throat]
Oh, my God, you scared me.
I didn't see you there.
Not very observant for a judge, bitch.
Ru, I brought you a cake.
All of the brothers
will want to eat this cake.
Speaking of,
I need to say hey to the new Pit Crew.
[Katya] Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere
Ru and I are great friends.
Well, I'm her best friend, see?
And I'm supposed to be a judge here!
<i>Someone slipped something in my drink</i>
<i>because I could not believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.
[grunting and screaming]
What in the name of La Toya Jackson
is going on here?
Merle fell and I think she bumped
that part of her brain.
Now she can't judge good drag from bad.
But we're supposed
to be shooting Season 3.
I guess I'll just have to take her place.
[laughs]
And that's how that devil bitch,
Michelle Visage, stole my job.
Next up, Michelle's story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
I'm Michelle Visage,
and here's what really happened.
{\an8}<i>I was visiting the set during Season 3,</i>
<i>sippin' on my sizzurp,</i>
<i>and I noticed RuPaul more upset than ever</i>
<i>before, because Merle was saying,</i>
<i>"Ru, these earrings would look much better</i>
<i>on someone pretty, like me."</i>
-And Ru said something like...
-Stay away from my things.
And stay away from my man!
Mother does not play that!
And I was like, "This bitch?"
I had to step in.
-Hey, I brought us all a cake.
-[Kandy] How sweet.
Let me tell the boys.
Well, look at this little witch,
trying to steal my job!
-Of course not.
-You can have my job.
I'm taking RuPaul's!
Get ready for Merle Ginsberg's Drag Race.
[Michelle] <i>Someone slipped</i>
<i>something into my drink</i>
<i>because I couldn't believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.
<i>And the next thing I remember,</i>
<i>Merle was trying to kill Ru!</i>
What in the name of Janice Dickinson
is going on here?
She was trying to kill you
and then take over the show.
Season 3 is coming, and I need a judge.
[gasps] Michelle, could you?
Then I said, reluctantly,
"If Ru needs me, then yes."
<i>"Yes, I will become a judge</i>
<i>on RuPaul's Drag Race."</i>
And that's why that devil bitch,
Merle Ginsberg, left the show.
Next up, my story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
You know what my name is but, frankly,
this is how it really went down.
{\an8}<i>I was oiling up the Pit Crew</i>
<i>when Merle came over to me and said,</i>
<i>"What if the drag queens judge us</i>
<i>instead of us judging them?"</i>
<i>And I said, "Only Judy can judge me."</i>
And then Michelle showed up,
and she had no cake.
All she brought me
was some dried up, old, nasty muffins.
And they weren't even gluten-free.
Happy Hanukah, RuPaul. [laughs]
My monkeys made you the potato salad.
Yay, I love an emotional time travel movie
with a strong female lead.
You two should talk.
I have to get to the...
Pit Crew.
-A worm stole my credit card once.
-German tourists often wear sandals.
[RuPaul] <i>I wish somebody had slipped</i>
<i>something in my drink, Kennedy,</i>
<i>'cause what ha-happened next</i>
<i>was cray-cray.</i>
And, child, that surveillance camera
caught everything.
<i>Felt like I was in the middle of freaknik</i>
<i>in Miami, Florida.</i>
What in the name of Fantasia Barrino
is going on up in here?
Who are we gonna get to judge Season 3?
[crying]
Just grab the crazy one
and put her on the judges' panel.
-And then the Pit Crew said...
-"Which one's the crazy one?"
There you have it. That's how
that devil bitch, Michelle Visage,
replaced that devil bitch, Merle Ginsberg.
Hand to God, honey.
[laughter and applause]
[Miss Fame] <i>The video wasn't</i>
<i>as bad as I was expecting it to be.</i>
{\an8}I still don't know what the fuck I said.
{\an8}If you asked me to repeat a line,
I would not know any of them.
Ladies, I've made some decisions.
Ginger Minj, yours is the winning team.
-Yes!
-You are all safe.
But tonight on the runway,
one of you stole the show.
Katya, Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
You'll receive
a $2,000 gift card from Fabric Planet.
{\an8}Yes! I won a challenge! I am so excited.
Bodily fluid's spraying out
of every orifice.
Katya, Ginger, and Kennedy,
you may leave the stage.
[RuPaul]
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
-[Ru] First up, Max.
-You as me?
I wasn't seeing it.
It was a little too masculine.
Max, I asked you for one thing.
What was it that I asked you for?
You asked me not to wear any gray hair.
I'm waiting, and I'm becoming impatient.
I couldn't disagree with Michelle more.
Gray hair is your thing and it's not bad.
Nobody's asking her to change,
just try something different.
-That's exactly what changing is.
-[laughs]
I love this look, because it told a story,
and it was scary but beautiful.
-You described Michelle.
-[laughs]
All right, up next, Violet Chachki.
Now, how many inches is your waist?
Either 18 or 19.
You might have been playing a dead person,
but we were living.
You as me, I'm not from Staten Island.
I am from New Jersey.
-What's the difference?
-We say our Rs, darling.
-It's a characterization, Michelle.
-'Cause I always talk like this, Ru!
-Like I'm Jackie Mason.
-All right, next up, Kandy Ho.
I am over the vampire thing.
I feel like it's a cliché now.
As Ru, the beard was back.
What was going on with the crazy hairline?
It was so stiff.
I didn't think you captured her at all.
All right, next up, Miss Fame.
How's your head?
It hurts.
I can barely hear inside this muff.
It's like a shell.
-She hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Thank you, Michelle.
Yesterday you had a mini breakdown on set.
What was going on?
It was self-sabotage.
My mouth is going and I can't shut up.
-I cannot stop my mouth.
-But I want you...
I want to be present
and get it out of the way.
I'm a sensitive,
heart on my sleeve person,
and I want to be able
to bring that to the panel.
-I want to show you that.
-But you have to learn to listen.
Because when I talk to you,
you're a bit ahead of what I'm gonna say.
The same with acting. You have to listen
so that you can respond properly.
I don't see what they are talking about.
I think you're fabulous.
-Thank you.
-All right, next up, Pearl.
Someone set their alarm clock
and finally woke up.
I definitely have shaken off
whatever was going on.
Talk about Death Becomes Her.
It feels like the old self died
and the new self has emerged.
And now we're gonna go
to you portraying me.
-What the fuck was that?
-[laughs]
I came alive
when I put that breastplate on.
-[Merle] It seems to work for everyone.
-Except for you.
Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
I got the convict,
'cause I might have dated a few in my day.
But looking at everybody,
I feel it's just a rung lower than them.
Yesterday was frustrating
because you didn't know the lines.
-Yeah.
-That bummed me out. I think you're good.
[RuPaul]
Thank you. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us squirrel friends,
what do you think? Let's start with Max.
She came out very goofy,
and I said, "Do you wanna fix that?"
And she said,
"No, this is Michelle's version of Merle."
Michelle, I can't believe
you would say Max is predictable.
-You don't know what she'll look like?
-No.
She'll have a white face,
gray hair, and a spot on her face.
As somebody who always wears
their hair the same, I identify with Max.
-Would you do gray hair?
-If it were in a ponytail.
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
I called her out on the comedy timing,
but that's just not her strong suit.
But to stand up there cinched like that.
That was amazing.
-I know, Ru, you've heard of Mr. Pearl.
-Yes.
The most famous corset maker in the world.
He has like a 16-inch waist.
I thought I'll never see a person
who looks like that.
-And tonight, we did.
-I miss us, Merle.
-I know, Ru. I do, too.
-So let's move on to Kandy Ho.
I feel like she's flat lined.
It was all wrong.
She was beautiful. I loved her movement.
But I don't find her memorable.
Miss Fame. Ross, I know
she had a little bit of a breakdown.
She actually timed out and said,
"Can I have a real moment here?"
I don't know. I love an emotional diva.
I just kind of relate to that.
[RuPaul]
Pearl has come a long way.
Her acting in the skit,
I really, really enjoyed it.
Have you and Michelle
ever made out in a vat of Jell-O?
-I would remember that.
-Is that what you're saying now in public?
Yeah, roll tape.
[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
When I got to sit with her on the set,
there were these moments of good,
but to get there was so much work.
That might be okay
if you're doing dinner theater,
but on the stage of RuPaul's Drag Race,
it's just not gonna cut it.
All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my ghouls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Max. You're safe.
Thank you.
Pearl.
You're safe.
[mouths words] Thank you.
Kandy Ho,
you vamped it up on the runway,
but you didn't sink your teeth
into the challenge.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki.
You're safe.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
this week you failed to break out.
Miss Fame, you got stuck in your head,
and not just by a 12-inch steak knife.
Jaidynn...
My dear, I'm sorry,
but you're up for elimination.
{\an8}Lord, my heart is beating,
my feet are shaking,
<i>and these are not my dance heels.</i>
Miss Fame, you're safe,
and you may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip-sync performance
of <i>Break Free</i> by Ariana Grande.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come...
...to lip-sync...
...for your life!
[Kandy] <i>Jaidynn has nothing on me</i>
<i>when it comes to lip-synching.</i>
Girl, mm-mm.

-[cries] Thank you.

Miss Ho, you came from Puerto Rico,

{\an8}<i>Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
{\an8}Category is... Hello Kitty.
{\an8}Kennedy is a catsuit queen.
{\an8}-Do you know how to make one?
-I don't.
{\an8}I don't know what to do with all this.
{\an8}Listen. The clock is running out.
{\an8}Category is Hello Kitty BFF Realness.
I love this look. I'm having waist envy.
Condragulations,
you are the winner of this challenge.
Kennedy, this look
could be more adventuresome.
Katya's eleganza.
I did not like it at all,
and there's no way Hello Kitty is allowed
to hang out with this Russian hooker.
Kennedy Davenport, shantay, you stay.
Katya, sashay away.
{\an8}[tense music]
{\an8}Walking into the workroom without Katya
{\an8}doesn't feel right.
"If you need me,
you know where to find me:
the dumpster out back."
Oh!
She's one of a kind.
I'm so sad to see her go.
And I can't believe
I'm crying on fucking TV.
Congratulations, Miss Violet. Next.
[laughs]
Kennedy Davenport,
your Hello Kitty was a "Hell no" kitty.
This is not a sewing competition.
You knew you had to sew,
and what the fuck did you do?
Girl, so what?  I'm not a seamstress.
I don't know how to sew.
But no other bitch has been able
to sing or act like me.
Oh, my God!
I'm in a pressure cooker.
The heat is on, and eventually,
it's just going to explode.
I need a smoke and a nap.

{\an8}[Michelle] Condragulations, ladies.
For your final four challenge,
you'll be starring with RuPaul
in the official music video
{\an8}for "Born Naked." #BornNaked.
{\an8}In a few moments, you'll be dancing
with choreographer Candis Cayne,
and then you'll be acting
with director Matthew Anderson.
-Yay!
-I hope you're hungry,
because you're each invited
to one last meal with mama Ru.
This is definitely not a time
to be half-steppin' it, ladies,
because tomorrow,
one of you will be eliminated
and edited out of the final video.
That's some shady shit.
Bitch, I'ma turn into Effie White.
This is <i>Dreamgirls</i>,
and I am telling you, I am not going.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-Hello, girls.
-Oh, my God! Hi!
{\an8}Today the choreography is gonna be
a throwback to the '80s strong woman look,
like Pat Benatar, Sheena Easton.
Okay, you start faced forward,
legs like this.
What makes me nervous
about this music video is the dancing.
It looks like one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
But that won't get
the best of me this time.
-Ginger, that looked great.
-Thank you.
[Candis] We're gonna move on.
Step, touch, step, touch,
step, touch. Violet,
in this, you need to get
a little bit lower.
Think '80s Cheryl Tiegs dancing.
I was born in '92.
That's no excuse.
Don't get frustrated. You have the look.
Just don't psych yourself out.
It's just steps.
{\an8}[Kennedy] <i>Violet...</i>
{\an8}girl, bye.
[light jazzy music]
[blender whirring]
-Kennedy, darling. Sit down.
-Hello.
[RuPaul] Are you hungry?
I'm juicing now, you know.
-This was your first time auditioning.
-Yes, m'am.
-And what took you so long?
-I was always working and struggling.
I just didn't have the time, really.
And then, like, after losing my dad,
it was like,
"You know what? It's time now."
My dad passed in October 2013,
and it's still so fresh to me.
<i>We didn't see eye-to-eye at first,</i>
but we ended up
having the best relationship.
He came to my pageants,
and we was always talking.
He told me, "You need to go
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>."
By him passing, it was, like, it's time.
I want to do it for my dad.
Wow.
And what would winning
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> mean to you?
Hoo-whee. Everything has been a struggle.
I've always been a caregiver,
because my sister
is severely mentally retarded,
and I had to step in.
<i>I took part in raising my sister.</i>
<i>I bathed her, I washed her clothes.</i>
I had big responsibilities
as a child myself.
<i>And it's repeating itself,</i>
<i>because since I lost my dad,</i>
now I'm her guardian.
I...
I never ask God why. I just take it on.
And I feel like being on here
and have made it this far is my reward.
It's an amazing story,
and you've done so well.
-I am so proud of you.
-Thank you.
I loved watching you work through it
and make it happen.
I will see you out there.
That's right, honey. I'm just saying.
-I.J.S!
-[both laugh]
I had fun actually doing the choreography.
I want to do well and go to the top three,
so I'm excited to do it.
I'm so excited. I mean,
learning choreo is not my strong suit,
but I think I've got it.
But you were having trouble
with the choreo,
and you've also been clocked
for your acting.
Does that scare you at all?
Really, bitch?
Not really. I've pushed through it
every single time.
But now you can't just push through.
With me with the dancing, I know
I have to nail it or I'm gonna go home.
What's your approach other than--
I'll enjoy that I'm in top four,
and I'm here to win it.
Any issues I'm having going into it,
I'm gonna work it out,
like I've been doing the entire season.
Get over yourself.
I've been over you since you walked in.
Keep 'em coming, girl. Keep 'em coming.
-Hi.
-Ginger Minj.
Who is your ally back home?
Do you have any allies in the family?
It's a cliché for every gay boy to say,
"My mom is my personal hero,"
but she's amazing.
-Are your parents together?
-No.
Do you have
a relationship with your father?
When I was 14 going into 15, he left us
for his high school girlfriend. And...
-I didn't talk to him for years.
-Wow.
What do you want him to know about you
that you think he doesn't know?
That's a tricky question.
I don't think he knows a lot about me.
I don't think that my father has...
I'm sorry.
My entire life, I have felt like
I didn't even know who my father was.
So how could he know anything about me?
{\an8}Growing up, I was so tormented in my life
{\an8}that the only way I could deal
was to make jokes
{\an8}and use humor to cover it all up.
My relationship with my father
has shaped me
into the human being that I am today.
No matter all the bullshit
that's happened in the past,
I just hope that...
-he's proud of me.
-Listen, I'm so proud of you.
-You are lovely, beautiful, and talented.
-That means the world to me.
Here, at least take one of these
for the ride home.
-Oh, thank you.
-I'll see you out there.
Muah! Bye.
-So whatcha wearing, pumpkin?
-I don't know.
I don't know if I want to do a gown.
It seems so, like, typical.
-Like, not enough?
-Yeah.
{\an8}I have tons of gorgeous dresses,
and I don't want to blend in
with these pageant girls.
How many times
have you gotten fucked in this?
Once or twice.
[whispering] What are they doing?
[whispering] Trying on their shit.
While Kennedy and I completely appreciate
what these kids are trying to do
with their modern take on drag,
old-school is the only school, honey.
They're in the corner playing dress-up
like it's kindergarten.
It's a walk-off.
[Pearl humming]
[whispering] Shut the fuck up...
{\an8}Ginger and Kennedy's final runway looks
are a mystery
{\an8}except for huge, gigantic
pageant girl hair.
<i>They're competing</i>
<i>for who can have the biggest hair </i>
on top of who is
America's next drag superstar.
All this bullshit
and they pulling out sleepers.
It will be comfortable
for their plane ride home.
{\an8}This is your time to make a statement.
<i>And the shit you pulling out...</i>
Girl...
-Hi.
-Violet, darling.
So when you auditioned for the show,
how far did you imagine yourself coming?
Oh, the winner. The crown... Girl.
Where did you get this confidence?
You have a lot of it.
Growing up, I was put
on the back burner for sure.
My sister had lots of stuff
she was going through.
I had to be my own support system,
my own biggest fan, so...
It sounds kind of lonely.
There's really no shoulder
for Violet to cry on.
-Besides my own.
-Right.
That's what you're showing
in this competition,
because you won
shadiest queen, remember?
-Did I?
-Did that hurt your feelings?
Kind of, but I knew that wasn't the case.
I was like, "I need to work harder
to show these girls who I really am."
I think the biggest thing
that I've learned
is to just be aware
of your first impressions,
because it could be difficult
to change someone's first impression.
I know that you're only 22, and you think,
"Well, a lot of people have this."
Let me tell you,
a lot of people don't have it.
You are really special.
A lot of people will take a lifetime
to get where you are.
-Thank you so much, Ru.
-Thank you.
-Pearl, darling, welcome to lunch.
-Thank you.
-Did you think you'd make it this far?
-Uh-uh.
You didn't? Have you surprised yourself?
I surprised myself coming in here
and retreating into "my shell."
I've never had these moments
of clamming up.
You were ready to tap out at one point.
I definitely was hurting, yeah.
But I'm all bark and no bite.
The thing is that I know your potential,
and I wanted to see it,
and I was feeling that it wasn't there.
-What was baby Pearl like?
-Baby Pearl?
-Yeah. Like, say, seven years old.
-Oh...
God!
When I was seven, you know,
I was scared shitless all the time.
I was going through
some pretty traumatic times.
It was just mental, emotional, physical,
psychological torment every day.
That's pretty rough. When I first met you,
I felt there was something else going on,
-and it felt like a traumatic issue to me.
-Yeah.
I'm not the kind of person
that opens up a lot.
So every time I do, it makes the weight
feel a bit more lifted off my shoulders.
Oh boy, has there been
a transformation in you.
At this point,
nothing can break my spirit.
Good. Well, condragulations.
-Mwah! Mwah!
-Mwah! Mwah!
<i>Flazéda</i>, girl!
-Hi, girls.
-Hi.

[Candis] Is there something going on here?
-Is that boy hair?
-Is it okay?
-I think your wig is sliding back.
-It's sliding back.
{\an8}These queens. Don't they know

You all are having wig problems.

I'm talking about with flies on it.
Bitch...
We might have got something.
I hope it's enough.
We'll see.
What the hell are you looking at?
{\an8}It's our acting scene,
directed by Matthew Anderson.
<i>We'll play three different characters,</i>
<i>and they're gonna be cut together.</i>
I'm gonna kick y'all's ass.
Ru is gonna act alongside us,
and it's a bit intimidating.
And... action.

we learned that all human beings
-evolved from lizards.
-You're a lizard.
Zip it, boy.
You kids are the reason
mommy needs her happy pills.
Ha-ha, look.
My dollies are kai-kai'ing.
You don't even know
what that means. I...
I hate it here. Woosh!
Okay, cut.
Pearl, you seem to just be hitting
one note all the way through.
You know, the anger you had
when you were gonna walk off the show?
-Remember that?
-Whoo-hoo!
-We all remember.
-Use that.
-Okay.
-Okay.
[Matthew] Here we go. Action!
Don't you give me no lip, boy.
Oh, I hate it here!
[Matthew] And cut. Very nice.
That was better with emotional intensity,
so, time to do the great switcheroo
and get into your next character.
All right, darlings, round two.
And... action.
Hurry up and eat.
Mommy's got to watch her stories.
Somebody pass me the potatoes.
Pearl is doing really well pilled-out.
[laughs]
-[Matthew] Action.
-What's that?
It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>,
available on iTunes.
Don't forget
to shamelessly plug that CD.
-Pick it up and show it.
-Okay.
Just show me
how you would do it right now.
Got it.
{\an8}Kennedy is an amazing performer,
but her biggest weakness
{\an8}is her short-term memory...
...loss.
Oh, pick it up?
It's RuPaul <i>Born</i>...
It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>,
available on iTunes.
Um, okay. Get the hell out of here
and change those damn outfits.
Action.
Don't you dare give me no lip, boy.
Don't call me boy.
Call me... Violet Chachki.
{\an8}Miss Violet
is flat lining as the teen queen.
Violet, you tend to sort of read
a bit of a monotone.
So let's just get
a few more spikes into your read.
-Okay.
-[Matthew] Very good.
[RuPaul] Isn't she clever?
-Action.
-Don't worry, little sister.
I'll come back for you when I'm famous.
Please make it stop.
[upbeat music]
-Whoo!
-Aaah!
-It's the last day.
-The last day.
It is the last time
that we are entering the workroom,
and at this point in the competition,
we're pretty much evenly divided
right down the middle.
On one end of the room, you have
Violet and Pearl, the "pretty girls,"
which they call themselves.
We don't call them that.
<i>And on the other end of the room,</i>
<i>you've got Kennedy and myself</i>
representing the bitter old lady brigade.
[Ginger Minj] I want to know
your first impressions that first day.
Pearl, when she came in,
and she was like, "Um,
I have a face chin on,
and blah, blah, blah."
-I was like, "This stupid bitch."
-"She's stoned."
"She's high as a kite out of her mind,"
so I guess my first impression
of Pearl was kind of spot-on.
Violet...
My first impression of you
is that, I mean,
you was full of yourself.
And has that changed?
No, it hasn't because...
because you haven't let it die down.
So I do respect you,
but still think you full of yourself.
I just feel like you are too young
to take on this type of responsibility.
I agree with Kennedy. It's a level
of maturity that you haven't reached yet.
[Kennedy] Thank you.
[Ginger Minj] This is a job title.
It's not just,
"Here's a check and a crown
and have fun."
You've got to be an ambassador
for <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
You are a representative, and I don't feel
like you've been in this game long enough
to know that you must step out of Violet
and be professional about some situations.
And I don't feel like you've been there.
You're not there yet.
Okay, I understand
more of what you're saying.
You don't want to be known
as being a bitch.
[Violet] That's it.
Violet is different.
In the beginning, she would be like,
"Fuck you.
I don't give a fuck what you think."
But here in this moment,
she's just listening and accepting it.
[Kennedy] You've got the bitter old
lady brigade to help guide.
I'm just saying.

{\an8}Tonight it's just family, so God help us.

[RuPaul] Yes.

<i>I am just head-to-toe pride.</i>

♪ <i>Now sissy that walk</i> ♪
Welcome, ladies.
I couldn't be more happy
to see my kids succeed,
and you really did.
Kennedy, you were born naked,
but you've grown to become
a fierce drag queen.
Here's a photo of you
as a little bitty boy.
If you could time travel,
what would Kennedy Davenport
have to say to little Ruben?
I would definitely have to tell him
that it's okay
that you are different
from the other kids.
All the nights that you have cried
yourself to sleep,
it'll be over soon.
And that you're gonna be respected
for your gift.
Thank you, Kennedy.
Violet, here's a photo of you
when you were four years old.
What would Violet Chachki
have to say to little Jason?
Um...
I would tell him
to try to have more patience
with everybody,
especially with your parents,
and you just need to know
how special you are
and really bask in moments of weakness
and find strength in them
and push through everything and get
to a ballet class as fast as you can.
-Thank you, Violet.
-Thank you.
Ginger, here is a photo of you
when you were five years old.
What would Ginger Minj
have to say to little Joshua?
When it feels like
the entire world is against you,
you've always got a friend in yourself,
and when it gets to that moment
where you feel there's no alternative,
and you want to end it,
remember that in your life
there's gonna be stupidity coming at you
from a never-ending parade
of bigoted assholes.
And the only way to survive that parade
is to make yourself the grand marshal.
-Thank you, Ginger.
-Thank you.
Pearl, here is a photo of you
when you were four years old.
I've never seen
that child before in my life.
What would Pearl have to say
to little Matthew?
Oh, God.
I'd have to start with a warning.
You're about to enter the toughest...
You're gonna enter
the toughest years of your life, and...
it's gonna suck really bad
for a long time.
People are gonna fuck you up
and take advantage of you,
and people are gonna be looking at you
from across the room for so many years,
and you're not gonna understand why.
-Do you understand why now?
-Yeah.
You're a star, baby.
Yeah...
Thank you, Pearl.
Ladies, the winners
of this week's challenge
will move on to the top three.
And one of you will be going home.
It's time for the judges' final critiques.
First up, Kennedy Davenport.
Let's take a look at your dailies.
♪ <i>We're all born naked</i>
<i>And the rest is drag</i> ♪
Hurry up and eat.
Mama's got to watch her stories.
Look, my two dollies are kai-kai'ing!
You don't even know what that means.
For the acting challenge, for me,
it was flat lined with no separation
between characters,
but you've made a lot of progress.
You look beautiful tonight.
This is representative of your best drag.
I really am very touched
about the transformation you've made.
Thank you.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
♪ <i>We're all born naked</i>
<i>And the rest is drag</i> ♪
-What's that?
-It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>, now on iTunes.
What happened to manly music?
Oh, I hate it here!
This is why we can't have nice things.
I know dancing is not your favorite thing.
With that said,
I thought your dancing was really good.
For the acting challenge, I think
you had separation between characters.
You told the story beautifully.
Don't take this as shade,
-but did you run out of clothes?
-Oh, God, no.
Because for me,
this does not say "Violet's best drag."
It's a natural progression.
I think I get what you're doing.
-I think you do too.
-Okay, thanks.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
♪ <i>We're all born naked</i>
<i>And the rest is drag</i> ♪
Guess who I saw
putting on mommy's makeup.
Shut up!
Boy, you'd better take off
that hoodie right now.
Don't call me boy. Call me...
Ginger Minj!
Your characters were the most fleshed-out.
Dancing is not your strong suit,
but I think you did it your way.
You had a wig malfunction,
and you made it work.
The fact that you went with it
shows your professionalism.
This bombshell white diamonds number
is the best drag that you've had
in the entire competition,
-and you saved the best for last.
-Thank you.
Next up, Pearl.
♪ <i>We're all born naked</i>
<i>And the rest is drag</i> ♪
You get out of my house now!
Fine! I'm leaving.
Wait! Don't leave me here with them.
Little sister, I'll come back for you
when I'm famous.
Attagirl, Pearl.
Who would have thought,
a few weeks ago, that we'd be here today?
-I figured it out. You're a weirdo.
-Oh, fuck yeah.
In this particular challenge, you pushed
yourself out of your comfort zone.
You gave us three definable characters.
Then with the dancing, you don't move,
and it becomes that stoner stripper
so high she just wants the dollars.
We've all been there.
I think you look beautiful. I'm proud.
-You earned your spot here. Congrats.
-Thank you.
[RuPaul] Ladies, final question.
Why should you, and not your competitors,
be crowned America's next drag superstar?
We'll start with Kennedy.
I've been in this business
for 17 long years,
and I condone myself with professionalism.
As far as my competitors,
with the exception of Ginger,
I don't think the other girls are ready.
So I fear that they may not know
how to condone themselves.
That makes me think, "What do you have
to offer once you become the queen?"
And it's not much.
[RuPaul] Thank you, Kennedy.
All right, Violet Chachki.
I already feel like I am
America's next drag superstar.
I've been telling myself that
for a long time.
I've always looked up to myself. The only
validation I need is from this show.
As far as my competitors go, I feel
like I represent the past, the present,
but more than anything, the future.
-Thank you, Violet.
-Thank you.
-All right, Ginger.
-If I could,
I'd split this with Kennedy.
I'd say, "Crown us both.
We'll get conjoined twin gowns,
and we'll wear them all year."
But my other two sisters,
as much as I do love them,
Violet has the shortest temper
I've ever seen.
And that's a problem
when you're dealing with the world.
And Pearl, as much as she has grown,
was ready to walk away
from a golden opportunity.
Not to mention this is America,
land of the free, home of the fat people,
and if we supersize our French fries,
why can't we at least supersize
our next drag superstar?
Thank you, Ginger.
-All right, Pearl.
-I've busted my fucking ass my entire life
for everything that I have,
every article of clothing,
every rent payment.
You've been telling me how exhausted
I come off, and it's because I am...
from life. Yes,
I totally had a moment on this show
where I didn't think that I could go on.
But that doesn't define
what I've done on this show.
I do not like to keep myself limited
into some kind of drag box,
and I have so much more to show America.
Thank you, Pearl.
Now, while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
All right,
just between us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
Her dancing was amazing.
She got rhythm.
And she is a great representation
of glamorous drag.
She's a hard worker,
and she is the professional of the group.
If she's the pro,
why wasn't that speech professional?
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
She's not a dancer, but she gave it
all she's got. She did a great lip sync.
And as far as her acting goes,
I was really proud of her.
She has told such a story
in her looks constantly.
I believe that she had
this last outfit planned all along.
That is not the best look.
Don't try to convince me.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Not a great dancer, but fine.
But she can give you comedy,
glamour, acting, and singing.
<i>She's a quadruple threat.</i>
She offers something different.
I grew up as a full-figured young boy.
And it does say something to kids
in small towns who may be chubby
that there's a chance
that they could rise to the top.
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>
At a certain point, we were all like,
"Check, please. I'm out."
But here she is in the top four
of this competition. That is so difficult.
{\an8}And she fought her way back.
And she made me fall in love with her.
She does have a boozy charm.
And it's star quality that she has
where you're intrigued, you know.
But is it too off-putting,
the sort of distance, for a fan
-to fall in love with her?
-I think they'll love her.
One more topic we need to discuss.
Michelle Visage. Carson, pros and cons.
Ah, you're funny.
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Ladies, before I can decide
who makes it to the top three,
this is your last chance to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come...
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life!
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

but you will not be moving on

Kennedy, the struggle is real.
And so is your God-given talent.
And your journey has just begun.
Thank you.

Hello.
I'm RuPaul, editrix in queef
of the <i>Drag Race</i> empire.
With just one week until the grand finale,
{\an8}<i>let's flip through the glossy pages</i>
<i>of the most fashionable season ever.</i>
{\an8}Is this the most fashionable season ever?
It is.
{\an8}This season, my girls had the skinny
on how to be a mean, lean queen.
{\an8}Coming in at number four,
abs everywhere! Abs everywhere!
{\an8}I'm here!
{\an8}Jasmine Masters' abs.
You could do your laundry on those.
You'd think her costumes would be cleaner.
-How did you get this body?
-Girl, I don't know.
{\an8}Abs everywhere. Just abs.
Boop, boop, boop.
{\an8}I hope she markets
a Jasmine Masters Ab Master.
{\an8}Get it? 'Cause her last name is Masters.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Serving Sleek Chic!</i>
Miss Fame is sleek and slim.
{\an8}Miss Thing is giving me supermodel.
{\an8}She should be called Miss On Fleek.
<i>Her body's on fleek,</i>
<i>her brows are on fleek.</i>
Fuck Fame. Just be Fleek.
I'd like to thank Mexico
for the tapeworm that snatched my body.
These girls are making me feel fat.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>No Pads, No Problem!</i>
Was padding out this season?
What's going on?
-Pearl.
-Uh-huh.
Now that you've come out of your shell,
maybe you could use that as a butt pad?
{\an8}Is she allergic to foam? I don't get it.
{\an8}If you are not wearing pads,
you are not doing drag.
I don't have to wear pads.
Pearl's body is fine.
She doesn't need pads. She's gorgeous.
Of course she needs to use pads.
You mean pad her personality? Oh, no.
I don't mind a skinny queen.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Cinch It!</i>
{\an8}Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh, Violet Chachki. That bitch.
She needed a breathing machine.
Iconic, legendary. That was epic.
I really could die, bitch.
I'm giving you realness.
I never want to meet you.
I hate you. Skinny bitch.
{\an8}Violet's a lovely girl.
It's a shame she's so morbidly obese.
-Hey, Violet, did you cinch?
-No, I have a hog body.
You call that a hog body, bitch?
Fail. #fail.
Thin may be in, but don't get it twisted.
Fat is where it's at.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Large is still in charge.</i>
{\an8}At number three: It Do Take Curves!
Kennedy is a perfect example
of a curvy queen.
[RuPaul] She has got
quite a backstory going on there.
She wears this horse's ass as pads,
and I fucking love it.
She's talented.
Big hair, pageant, Texas drag.
[RuPaul] The rainbow leads
right to her pot of gold.
Her ass.
Come on, badonkadrrrrrk.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>Binge on the Minj.</i>
{\an8}<i>I like to describe myself</i>
<i>as a glamor toad.</i>
I love a glamor toad. [croaks]
I'm envious

and just the cheeseburgers
and the ham hocks all around her.
You owned being thick-ums.
Come on, thick-ums!
I'm suffering from Ginger-vitis.
And I love it.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one:</i>
<i>May the Fierce Be With You!</i>
{\an8}How y'all doing?
{\an8}Jaidynn walked in
jiggling from left to right.
I love a big bitch. Work, mama.

[Ross] Oh, Beyoncé who?
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm giving the judges curves</i>
<i>and swerves and plump-a-liciousness.</i>
We've got to cook together.
I can throw down in the kitchen.
Fried chicken, corn bread, green beans.
<i>J'adore </i>Jaidynn Diore.
My girls always give good face.
But this season, they took it up a hair.
{\an8}Let's hear it for our hairy Marys. Ooh.
Ooh, girl, you know Willam was pissed
for missing out on that beard challenge.
{\an8}[RuPaul]<i> Number five: Abe-solutely!</i>
<i>Yowza, Baberaham Lincoln.</i>
Katya came out as Abraham Lincoln,
who has one
of the most famous beards in history.
His wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: Red Alert!</i>
I really liked Pearl
in her little papier-mâché beard.
[RuPaul] It's the devil made her do it.
[Jinkx] <i>She kind of looked</i>
<i>like the villain from the Powerpuff Girls.</i>
The one who's like,
"Yes, Powerpuff Girls."
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Use Your Head!</i>
I haven't had any complaints.
Kandy Ho had this amazing
box of hair on her head.
-[RuPaul] Who doesn't love a hairy box?
-[Michelle] My husband.
Which actually happens to me a lot
when I put wigs in suitcases.
You pull them out,
and that's how they look.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Hello Dalí!</i>
-[Mel B] I love the beard.
-My favorite beard look was Max.
He just looked like avant-garde.
Although I don't know what it is.
{\an8}Number one: Good Golly, Miss Molly!
{\an8}It's rock and roll legend Little Richard!
If you're wearing facial hair in the game,
you'd better be the biggest queen there.
{\an8}♪ <i>A-wooo!</i> ♪
Good golly, Miss Molly,
you might want to shave the upper lip.
-You can't do that.
-Why?
'Cause it's a man.
It was crazy that the other girls
were complaining about it
{\an8}because there was a Needles impersonator
who happens to be a man,
{\an8}and an Alyssa Edwards impersonator,
who happens to be a man.
{\an8}♪ <i>Wooo!</i> ♪
{\an8}Shut up.
When it came to showing skin,
my girls were born naked,
and they stayed that way.
You're born naked and the rest is awful.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Now touch all this skin, Henny.</i>
{\an8}<i>Number four: Show Your Assets.</i>
She just bent over
and gave you the whole story.
-Emphasis on the hole.
-[Michelle] What an ass.
I hope she had shaved.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>She's a Real Cut Up!</i>
{\an8}Ginger ripped it all off
in that conjoined twin lip synch.
That bitch pulled out scissors
and cut herself away from Sasha Belle.
Where was she holding them?
Were they under her wig?
Sometimes you have to allow
your audience to see you bare it all.
Even if that means that your titties
are hanging out and your wig is off.
That was a titty-twister.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>When in Doubt, Whip it Out.</i>
{\an8}There is some stuff in that workroom
you do not want to see.
I mean, some of y'all do.
[Pearl] Trixie's back,
that uncut dick hanging out.
[Pearl] Let's see your wiener.
We haven't seen one in a while.
-It's not in a good place right now.
-Show us your dick!
-It's shriveled up now.
-I want to look.
Can I fluff for a second?
Hold on, I need to think good thoughts.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: You Do You!</i>
{\an8}For Violet's nude illusion,
she just came out nude with a little tape.
[judges gasp]
[Violet] <i>I'm comfortable being naked</i>
<i>with a piece of duct tape on and a smile.</i>
If I was doing nude illusion, I'd come out
naked and say, "This is what you wanted."
And then I'd lift up my penis,
and there'd be a disco ball underneath.
Panties, bitch!
My fashionistas, with just one week until
the grand finale of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
which one of these top three cover girls
should be America's next drag superstar?
{\an8}<i>Are you Team Ginger Minj?</i>
{\an8}<i>Team Pearl? Or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
Let your voice be heard.
I think I was confused by the assignment.
-More nudity!
-Okay, girl.
This has been
our most snatched season ever.
Basic witches not wanted.
{\an8}What keeps my girls looking good
and feeling gorgeous?
{\an8}Well, they got their secrets.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Fitness is fierce.</i>
{\an8}Health tips from drag queens?
Are you crazy?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Fit tip number five:</i>
<i>Don't Forget to Stretch.</i>
{\an8}♪ <i>All I ever wanted</i>
<i>All I ever wanted</i> ♪
{\an8}Katya, that bitch can spread
her legs like peanut butter.
[Katya] <i>I pounded my vagina into the stage</i>
<i>so hard that the building shakes.</i>
{\an8}Katya's very limber.
[Bianca] <i>Katya has amazing muscle control.</i>
She must be
the most popular hooker on her corner.
I'm kidding. Nobody fucks her.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: Don't Act Your Age.</i>
Sissy that walker?
That is <i>All Star 2055.</i>
Senior citizens' edition.
[RuPaul] Girl, your pacemaker is on fire!
[laughter]
Ru is shady, making them dress up
like old ladies so he looks young.
Don't you wish your granny
was hot like me?
{\an8}Another challenge
where Max never dropped character.
{\an8}I think he remained an old lady
for the rest of the season.
I love the smell
of Bengay in the morning.
{\an8}We know what they're going to look like
in about 20 years, some in five.
Shade goggles.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Get Plenty of Rest! But not too much.</i>
{\an8}Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.
A drag queen who's sleepy
all the time. Original.
[RuPaul] It's like a runway on Ambien.
{\an8}I think Pearl just sleep-lives.
{\an8}You just have those personalities
that are just natural stoners,
even if they've never picked up a blunt.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
{\an8}Wake the fuck up, Pearl.
Pearl, honey, it's time for school.
Wake up.
Ah! Okay, I'm awake.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>Dance Your Padded Ass Off!</i>
{\an8}♪ <i>Strawberry, kiwi, peach</i>
<i>Tongues tied, slur your speech</i> ♪
Dancing is important exercise.
Well, actually, I don't dance.
I just have sex.
♪ <i>When I shake my ass</i>
<i>I'm makin' money, money, money</i> ♪
That shit looked hard. I can't do that.
I thought I was watching
<i>So You Think You Can Dance?.</i>
♪ <i>Can I get it to go?</i>
<i>Can I get, can I get it to go?</i> ♪
From the house of Beyond Belief
Dance Company, two thumbs up.
Ding!
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Fly Girl, Fly!</i>
{\an8}Flinging yourself off a stage
and landing in a split is always in vogue.
Kennedy served all the fitness.
Calisthenics and Pilates was happening.
And the facial muscles were all working.
Roar, Kennedy! [growls]
[meows] That's my roar.
Whew, that was a workout.
But if getting physical isn't your thing,
you can always get some good work.
I've never thought of that before.
{\an8}'Cause Plastic is Fantastic.
Tape: it's not just for tucking anymore.
[Bianca] <i>Those tape face-lifts</i>
<i>looked so natural.</i>
Just like Miss Fame's face
in the first episode.
Who knew looking this good
could be this cheap?
{\an8}This is the nose
I have always dreamed of.
{\an8}It's like Phantom of the Opera
meets Joan Rivers. Oh!
How do I sleep at night?
Ask your husband.
[laughs]
[chewing]
People always ask me,
"What's your diet secret?" It's simple.
A mint for breakfast,
a mint for lunch, and for dinner...
-a glass of water, no mint.
-Really?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>I'm proud to present</i>
<i>the Drag Race Diet.</i>
Eat it!
Now here's some real useful advice:
never skip meals.
There's always room for Jell-O.
{\an8}[groaning]
What in Fantasia Barrino
is going on up in here?
{\an8}-Cut!
-Oh, my fucking god.
[Pearl] <i>I was sitting</i>
<i>in 40-degree Jell-O. I'm freezing.</i>
Miss Fame has a total erection
rubbing on me.
Just get me out of here.
I actually heard red wine
is quite good for you... by the box.
{\an8}-[Michelle] Leopard line, box of wine.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
{\an8}I don't drink wine,
{\an8}but if I were on the stage and it's
all that's there, let's get classy drunk.
He better have that boxed wine chilling.
Pinkies up, girls.
My number-one diet tip? Protein.
I like long walks on the beach,
big dicks, and eggs.
{\an8}♪ <i>Eggs, eggs, eggs</i>
<i>All I want is eggs</i> ♪
She's the egg queen.
Coo, coo, ca, choo.
This season, everyone is wearing eggs.
♪ <i>All I want is eggs, eggs, eggs</i> ♪
Your country breakfast is ready.
When it comes to coining an expression,
my girls are real trendsetters.
That's right.
{\an8}So pay attention
and get ready to sissy that talk.
My pussy is trending on Craigslist.
What are these kids
coming up with nowadays?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number eight: Better Call FEMA!</i>
{\an8}When I see Jamal there,
I about flood my basement.
Bring out the sandbags.
-[all cheering]
-[Violet] Oh, my goodness!
Santino Rice.
I flood my basement, bitch.
That's going to be a mess to clean up.
Mildew and mold.
You need, like, the Rug Doctor.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number seven: The Chachki Cheer.</i>
{\an8}[Violet] Aaah! Come through!
[RuPaul] Come through, mama.
[Violet] That waist, bitch. Come through!
Come through, long hair.
Come through, psoriasis.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number six: Cooking with Pam.</i>
{\an8}[Jaidynn] <i>No, ma'am, Pam. No turkey.</i>
-No, ma'am, Pam.
-Yes, ma'am, Pam.
Yes, ma'am, Pam.
No, ma'am, no ham, no Pam,
no cauliflower, no cornbread, no beans.
Who's Pam?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number five:</i>
<i>Build that Brand, Girl.</i>
{\an8}Miss Fame is a fucking brand.
I'm like, ew, I don't, bitch. My brand.
I'll call myself a brand every day.
I'm a goddamn brand.
You a brand, a brand.
A brand what, muffin?
Miss Fame's brand...
Well, she's a hand model.
Isn't she? She always doing this.
-Miss Fame.
-Oh, the brand.
Miss Fame claims to be a brand.
Yeah, so is Kirkland, bitch.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: The Kennedy Curse.</i>
{\an8}Child, the struggle is real.
Clearly, the struggle is real.
You know what's real? The struggle.
The real struggle she's having
is getting her ass in pantyhose.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>When Life Gives You Lemons.</i>
No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.
Ooh, I love me some pink lemonade.
Bitch got me thirsty.
[Jasmine] <i>No tea, no shade,</i>
<i>no pink lemonade.</i>
Why's she taking all the beverages away?
-Don't be mad.
-Ding!
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Pearls of... Wisdom?</i>
{\an8}We're probably the two most,
kind of, <i>flazéda</i> sort of, like...
-The most what?
-<i>Flazéda</i>, it's a new hashtag.
She sleeps. When she wakes up,
she's talking shit nobody understands.
-[RuPaul] Well, <i>flazéda</i>.
-How you spell that?
F-L-A-D... No.
F-L-A...
{\an8}Give me a pen.
F-L-A-Z, E with a hyphen over it, D-A.
{\an8}Make sure that you hyphenate that "E."
It's very important.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] <i>Number one...</i>
-Shit RuPaul says.
Hey, that's me.
She done already done had herses.
She done already done has herses.
Is that correct?
She done already done had herses.
What does "herses" mean?
Um, okay. I was coming from the club.
And I went to Krystal Burger
in Atlanta, Georgia.
And we would go and get our food on after,
you know, partying and everything.
Somebody had come up to pick up a bag,
but it actually didn't belong to them.
And this girl behind the counter said,
"Uh-uh, no, no, no.
She done already done had herses."
And of course, I've, you know...
taken that to the bank.
With one week until the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
which one of the top three cover girls
deserves the crown?
{\an8}Sound off now,
because if you snooze, you lose.
-Right, Pearl?
-[blows raspberry]
<i>Our cover girls weren't the only ones</i>
<i>who exposed themselves this season.</i>
Our judges and extra-special guest judges
kept it real,
served it raw, and got it twisted.
<i>Get ready for</i> Star Secrets Exposed.
-Am I giving too much today?
-No.
-Look around.
-Okay, good.
-Yeah, true. What am I saying?
-Look around.
You're young to have hot flashes.
[Mel] I'm not that young.
I'm 39. I was like, shit.
So Victoria was
the first one who turned 40?
[Mel] Geri. But then again,
nobody really knows how old Geri is.
She holds that passport so tight.
How dare you, Michelle?
She comes out here in crutches
with some Amadeus realness, right...
Darling, it's always the same silhouette.
You can throw crutches on it,
still the same silhouette.
-That silhouette with the powdered wig--
-Snatch waist. The same thing.
No dessert for either of you tonight.
Poop is natural. Everybody poops.
[Demi] I don't.
Ever.
This season, the fashion was on fleek.
But in a season of killer looks,
which bitch wore it best?
Let's hear from Raja and Raven
on how to look like a winner, baby.
{\an8}We're talking about our favorite looks
of season seven of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
And one that we didn't quite... get.
One of my top picks was Miss Kennedy
in her leather and lace gown.
[Raja] <i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Very Kennedy. Very LaGuardia.</i>
Probably more Newark, but still cute.
Here's my first favorite.
Katya in the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.
I always love a bit of a sight gag.
It's like the banana peel in comedy.
<i>If I were in that challenge,</i>
<i>I would've done something more glamorous.</i>
Asphyxiation via a fabulous silk scarf
from a floating chandelier above me.
And then I would sing
"Chandelier" by Sia.
Cue music. Oh, no, we can't afford it.
My next look was Violet Chachki
in her Hello Kitty extravaganza.
<i>Other-worldly, very reminiscent</i>
<i>of Hello Kitty herself.</i>
Isn't Uranus the planet
with the ring around it?
-No.
-That's Jupiter.
-[Raven] <i>Now, let's talk about RuPaul.</i>
-[Raja] <i>The goddess herself.</i>
My favorite was the black velvet dress
painting of herself with the white afro.
[Raven] <i>Honey, this look featured</i>
<i>naked RuPaul riding a black panther.</i>
-It was different.
-Yeah.
She never brings
anything up around the neck.
Maybe she just had a hairy chest that day.
Whatever. She looks great.
I love this look. Yes, God.
Now, my least favorite look
from the entire season
had to be Kennedy's look
for the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.
-What was that?
-A huge WTF.
[Raja] <i>#chickenorwhat, remember that?</i>
Her explanation of the outfit
did not make sense.
Something about being a hooker
and a phoenix rising and...
-Crystallize.
-Oh, my God.
She just looks like a crystal meth addict
in Phoenix, Arizona.
-Can we go to break?
-No.
The biggest prize of all is still to come.
{\an8}<i>Which of our top three cover girls</i>
<i>deserves the crown?</i>
Let me and the world know all about it.
Scientists have discovered
that honesty isn't just the best policy,
it adds years to your life, which means
these bitches are going to live forever.
{\an8}<i> Realness rules</i>
<i>in our top three moments of truth.</i>
{\an8}Is honesty the best policy?
Of course.
{\an8}At number three: Mad About Michelle.
{\an8}I hate Michelle Visage.
{\an8}Yeah, you're gonna win now.
{\an8}Some of these queens,
I feel like they bitchy-osed this season.
{\an8}What contestant that young goes on
a reality show competition like RuPaul's,
which is a lot of work,
and says, "I hate the main judge"?
Like, that is punk.
Girl!
She probably has a bigger man-body
than I do without her implants.
[Jasmine] Come on, don't go there, girl.
{\an8}I like her.
{\an8}How are you going to win the challenge
and then get back in the workroom...
and done try to sneak one in
on Michelle Visage?
Honey, we all hate Michelle Visage.
We just don't say it with cameras around.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Queens Go Clean.</i>
-How long have you been sober for?
-I've been sober for nine years.
But counting days in here
feels like being a newcomer.
That's what it feels like.
{\an8}It's nice to see drag queens
talking about their sobriety
{\an8}because partying and drinking excessively
have been a part of the gay community,
but it doesn't have to be.
You're being so hard on yourself.
You're in it, but you're not alone.
I'm here with you
having those same fears and feelings.
I mean, good for Katya and Miss Fame.
I love sobriety.
<i>I mean, good on them.</i>
Clean streets are the best streets.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Motherly Love.</i>
{\an8}Pearl had that sort of really scary,
uncomfortable moment
{\an8}with RuPaul.
Well, you kind of told me
I had no personality.
I mean, that doesn't make me feel good
or give me confidence.
I said, "Oh, girl.
Don't do it, Jackie. Don't do it."
Stop, stop, stop it, stop, stop.
No, no, no, no, no, no, stop.
[Bianca] <i>Don't look at Ru in the eyes.</i>
<i>You're turning into stone.</i>
You're turning into stone.
She is taking your soul.
Do I have something on my face?
Bitch! Ow! No.
No, I'm just not convinced.
And I want you to do well.
That's why I brought your ass here.
I was uncomfortable.
Clutching my pearls.
I didn't even mean that like that.
You know, FYI, for all you girls up there,
I don't want to hear any goddamn excuses.
Ru got into it this season too.
She let them have it after that challenge.
Be prepared.
-We didn't have time to re-rehearse...
-Make it work. Make it work.
If Ru yelled at me like that,
I would have just cried.
I'd be like, "I'm Jasmine Mastering it up.
I'm packing all my shit, and I'm out.
I'm not wanted here anymore."
Fucking make it happen. I don't want
to hear any goddamn excuses anymore.
The last thing you want to do
is piss off Ru. Mm-mm.
I still can't look her in the eye.
She's terrifying.
[laughs]
It's hard for viewers to truly appreciate
what our girls go through each season.
I'm sorry, I need to relax.
[RuPaul] <i>So I've called</i>
<i>a professional to break it down.</i>
Coming from a place of love,
light, and understanding,
please welcome... Bianca Del Rio.
Aw, who needs a hug?
Kidding. Don't come near me.
<i>Let's start with Tempest DuJour.</i>
[grunts]
I saw a drag queen in a Mexican restaurant
do that exact same entrance.
Except it wasn't a baby.
-That's disgusting.
-[Ru laughs]
Which leads us to Mrs. Kasha Davis.
I'm home!
Miss Kasha Davis is from Upstate New York,
where they produce winners
like Pandora Boxx and Darienne Lake.
-What?
-There's no talent in the water.
-Trixie Mattel.
-So...
It was really so sad to see Trixie go.
Twice. Ha-ha!
<i>Max.</i>
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.
Max is always complaining
that drag queens are too vulgar.
You know what's vulgar?
That fucking accent, bitch.
And that brings us to Miss Fame.
I'm hitting a wall, and I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.
Her personality is so amazing
that, growing up,
her only friends were chickens.
Some people would say I love cock.
Ca-caw! And then there's
our distinguished top three.
Ginger Minj claims to be the glamor toad,
but when you look at her,
she's been eating more than flies.
Pearl. The best thing about Pearl's drag?
She's cute as a boy.
[Bianca] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
[Michelle] <i>Her waist is so small!</i>
I was really shocked when I saw
Violet come out with that oxygen tank.
-'Cause that meant Ru wasn't using it.
-Bitch!
-And who can forget Michelle Visage?
-Mmm...
She's constantly saying that,
"RuPaul is my best friend."
Funny thing is you don't hear Ru say it.
The opinions expressed
by Bianca Del Rio do not represent
{\an8}those of RuPaul's Race,
Logo TV, World of Wonder,
{\an8}the NAACP, or the Friends
of the Pacoima Public Library.
Except the part about Michelle Visage.
I kind of agree with that one.
Now, our top three queens,
Pearl, Ginger Minj, and Violet Chachki,
have each made it this far
thanks to a certain thing
we call <i>je ne sais quoi</i>,
which in French means
"their pussies are on fire."
{\an8}-Hi, fellas.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger, a plus-size powerhouse,</i>
<i>a killer comedian,</i>
<i>and a natural-born performer.</i>
{\an8}-I love you, Justin Bieber.
-[laughs]
Ginger can serve up some strong tea...
We don't mean any harm, girl.
Except when we do.
And still leave you gagging for more.
{\an8}Ginger Minj for the crown.
This girl has it all.
{\an8}She can sing, act, dance...
Nope, not so much dance.
Boom, boom, boom.
{\an8}She is confident, funny,
and she just looks like she smells good.
Pearl, your razor burn is so bad
the only way I can read you is by braille.
She can read a bitch for filth
with a beating heart underneath it all.
I can't believe I'm crying on fucking TV.
What Ginger has that no one else has
<i> is that extra...</i>
fifty pounds.
{\an8}[laughs]
{\an8}I cannot wait to see
a big girl win <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}I always thought Jinkx Monsoon
was the first plus-sized winner.
This season,
Ginger accomplished the impossible.
<i>She got gay men everywhere screaming...</i>
I love the minj.
[RuPaul] <i>But does Ginger</i>
<i>have the right amount of sugar, spice,</i>
<i>and show-stopping skills</i>
<i>to snatch the crown?</i>
In one week, all will be revealed.
{\an8}<i>Next up, a precious gem</i>
{\an8}<i>who took her own sweet time</i>
<i>to come out of her shell.</i>
{\an8}-'Sup?
-<i>But once she did...</i>
-she sparkled.
-Thank you.
-Pearl.
-Pearl is beautiful.
This porcelain mug.
You can't mess with that.
Pearl has
a very New York approach to drag.
She always puts
that high-fashion twist on it.
Bitch, you can wear fur in spring, okay?
I mean, Pearl's hot. As a boy, goddamn it,
she can get me pregnant.
Totally. I'll raise it.
I think the turning point for Pearl
was she started listening to the judges.
And she, like, took her Adderall.
It's neat to see
vulnerability come out of Pearl.
I didn't know that tears
came out of them sleepy eyes.
What would Pearl
have to say to little Matthew?
You're going to enter
the toughest years of your life.
It makes you want to hug her.
And everybody grows.
I mean, she's growing. She grew!
You're a star, baby.
I love her.
Sleeper queen Pearl had the tenacity
<i>to rise and shine her way to the top.</i>
<i>Her attitude and edgy looks</i>
<i>have fascinated the nation,</i>
leading many to believe
the jewel in the crown will be a Pearl.
Yeah!
{\an8}Uh-oh. Ooh, la, la, la, la, la.
-Last...
-Yay!
But by no means least...
<i>She's young, beautiful, and outspoken.</i>
That's right.
With a sophisticated knowledge of fashion
well beyond her years.
<i>When it comes to style,</i>
<i>she just might have this competition</i>
<i>all cinched up.</i>
This is Violet Chachki.
I love her style. She has a great eye.
She does a beautiful makeup.
Violet should win based purely
on the fact that she had a black thing
and took off the belt,
and it turned into a plaid thing.
Oh, that look was everything.
{\an8}-Miss Thing.
-[tongue pops]
{\an8}That ho's been reading some magazines.
The internet happened.
Have you heard of it?
Oh!
Violet is a bitch.
I don't trust a drag queen that isn't one.
[Violet] <i>People think I'm mean,</i>
but everything I've done comes
from a place of humor or a place of truth.
She's not bad.
She's just painted that way.
I want you to know that I'm going
to be working on the way I come across.
She's like Courtney,
you got to get to know her
to know that there's no malice.
-You have something that I don't have.
-Beauty?
She's still a bitch,
but she's a bitch with a heart of gold.
Like Bianca Del Rio.
Violet evolved
from a fiery-tempered fashionista...
-What?
-<i>To a glamazon with grace.</i>
<i>But in a race</i>
<i>that's tighter than her corset,</i>
can Violet snatch the crown officially?
Come through!
There you have it. Your top three queens.
But which one of these cover girls
will be America's next drag superstar?
{\an8}It's anybody's guess.
Are you Team Ginger Minj?
{\an8}<i>Team Pearl? Or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
{\an8}<i>Hashtag it now and tell the world.</i>
It's your chance to break the Internet.
Who do you want to snatch the title
of America's next drag superstar?
<i>Are you Team Ginger,</i>
<i>Team Pearl,</i>
<i>or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
And one week from tonight,
I'm reserving you a front-row seat
<i>to the grand finale of</i> RuPaul's Drag Race<i>.</i>
All right, girlfriends. Loosen your tuck.
Let it all hang out
for the world premiere
of <i>Born Naked: The Music Video.</i>
And remember,
if you can't love yourself naked,
how the hell you going to love
somebody else naked?
Can I get an amen up in here?
[all] Amen.
Now, let the music video play.

-That.
-Fuck!

-Oh, my God!

for a reason.
{\an8}Kandy Ho."
{\an8}I survived the lip sync,
and no, ma'am, Pam, no ham,
{\an8}no turkey, no cauliflower.
I can't do that again.
{\an8}I'm fixing to do one wig that's not gray,
and then I'm going right back to gray.
{\an8}Sorry, Michelle. She was like,
"What did I tell you last week?"
If they gave me specifics,
I would fucking do it.
{\an8}Miss Max still choose
to pull out them dust-ass gray-ass wig.
<i>I'd like to see her at the bottom,</i>
so she can get a reality check.
I.J.S. I'm just saying.
Let's talk about you in this corset.
How does she breathe?
I don't get it.
I feel amazing!
Are we gonna sit around and talk,
or are we gonna get out of drag?
[Violet] Collect all them stones, girl.
{\an8}I'm over Kennedy missing
the mark on these looks.
Didn't look like she was dead
nor like a woman.
{\an8}Kennedy's look is like, "What?"
She was like...
"The fuck, what am I supposed
to do for this one?"
I honestly think Kennedy just needs to go.
She looks like Tony the Tiger on crack.

<i>You're a drag queen. Be funny!</i>
-I have nothing to say.
-For once.
[Ginger laughs]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi.
[Violet] A vision in polka dot.
For weeks, you have been encouraged
to show us the real you.
And you know what?
I've had about all of that I can take.
So today, it's time to find out
who else you can be.
-That's right!
-[Max] Oh, no.
This week's maxi-challenge...
Snatch Game!
{\an8}Now go on and hashtag that.
{\an8}Snatch Game is the challenge
that every fan has been waiting for.
We put on giant, latex frog costumes,
and we go through a fiery obstacle course.
Okay, all right. I'm sorry.
You compete on a live game show,
a parody of the <i>Match Game</i>.
You need to impersonate another star's
charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
But be careful whose you choose.
'Cause it could be a very hairy situation.
I know that feeling.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Okay, Snatch Game. Down to business.
-Who are you doing?
-Donatella Versace.
I'm doing Donatella Versace!
I've been working on this
for eight months.
I should be out there.
This would be a great chance to push
myself out of the pretty little box.
{\an8}I'd been planning to do Donatella
since the first time I auditioned.
I mean, come on, girl.
One of you has to be
the bigger person and just bow out.
-[Miss Fame] Do you have a backup?
-Not at all.
I literally don't have
any other choice. I'm doing it.
-[Katya] Who are you gonna do?
-I was thinking about...
doing Little Richard.
-But he's a man.
-You can't do that.
-Why?
-'Cause it's a man.
But I'll be in drag.
He been in drag his whole life.
-No, ma'am.
-No Richard.
It's a man!
Snatch... Vagina!
[Ginger] Why don't you do Sweet Brown?
She only has one line.
-She's got a monologue.
-She's got, "cold pop,"
"bronchitis," and,
"ain't nobody got time for that."
It's funny,
and people are gonna know who it is.
I'm really torn. I just don't know
who I'm gonna do at this point.
[Violet] Who are you gonna do?
[Max] Sharon Needles.
Max is doing Sharon from season four.
She has a darker side to her.
I'll do Disney Sharon Needles.
Really? Sharon's shocking and punk-rock,
and that's kind of
out of character for Max.
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hello.
-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.
-Who are you gonna be?
-Raven-Symoné.
How are you gonna channel Raven-Symoné?
She's just kinda high-pitched,
and she's always like, "Oh!"
Girl, no comment.
If we met, we could be best friends.
But what does that have to do
with Snatch Game?
We sitting in the audience have to say,
"Ah, that is so Raven!"
You get back to work.
Hey, good looking. What you got cooking?
I had an unexpected turn of events today.
-What happened?
-Two of us had the same character.
-What queen is it?
-It's Violet.
We were both gonna do
Donatella Versace, but...
I've chosen to do Theresa Caputo,
the Long Island Medium.
Yeah, yeah.
Was it a discussion, or she said,
"I am doing Donatella"?
-She didn't have a backup, and--
-Listen, Miss Fame,
the competition is narrowing down.
So you've got to go for the jugular.
You were kind enough
to change your first choice,
But being kind is one thing.
Being the winner is completely different.
Do what's in your best interest,
not in the best interest of others.
Well, shit, I'll be Versace.
This is a competition. Sometimes,
you have to step over other girls
to get where you wanna go.
So... Sorry, girl.
{\an8}Today's maxi challenge is Snatch Game,
which is a <i>Drag Race</i> version
of the original show, <i>Match Game.</i>
-Hello, Katya.
-Hi.
-Who are you?
-Suze Orman.
-Have you done her before?
-No.
I know that you do a Russian accent,
'cause the Katya character is Russian.
Why didn't you do a Russian character?
'Cause you do it so well.
What is it you're afraid of?
I don't know. I think my whole life,
I've been riddled with anxiety,
-fearful of things that aren't a big deal.
-Ah.
{\an8}I'm afraid to show
this character because it's...
{\an8}the thing that I do best,
and I am terrified of failing at it.
You have an addiction to the anxiety.
I've never thought of that before.
I've been addicted to alcohol,
crystal meth, cocaine.
You're here because you're super talented.
-Don't be afraid.
-Okay.
[Katya] <i>Addicted to anxiety.</i>
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.
-Who are you doing?
-I've been trying to figure it out,
so I came up with Sweet Brown...
-"Ain't nobody got time for that."
-Or Little Richard.
Uh-huh. Is that what you're gonna go with?
I just... I don't really know.
I'm torn, really.
Well, I'm gonna leave that to you.
I can't decide for you,
and that's all I'm gonna say.
{\an8}I think it's very risky
going with Little Richard.
The stakes are very high going into
the Snatch Game, so I'm just debating.
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.
I heard a little rumor
that you're doing an Italian superstar.
-I am Versace.
-She's been funny in skits on television.
How will you avoid doing
what someone else has done?
I think I can execute a better look than--
Look is one thing.
There is a different skill to be funny.
-Let me hear your Italian accent.
-A woman should feel confident, sexy.
She should put something on her body
and feel like she owns the world.
All right.
What other ideas did you have?
I was thinking of even doing
Alyssa Edwards maybe.
Can I see your Alyssa Edwards?
Real once, done. Top, bottom, done.
That's good. You might want
to consider switching to Alyssa.
Motherfucker. Stir the pot, RuPaul.
Do you want a spoon?
All you gotta do is make me laugh. Okay?
-Get to work.
-Thank you.
All right.
Can I get a time check?
I cannot believe this shit.
[Pearl] If you're more comfortable
doing Donatella, then do it.
I'm more comfortable doing
Donatella when there was just one.
I guess I'm gonna fucking do
Alyssa Edwards then.
[Pearl] You don't have to do it
just because RuPaul said you should.
Am I gonna do better than her?
Or is it gonna be competition?
It will definitely be a competition.
Ladies, later today, I will meet you
on the set of Snatch Game.
So good luck and don't fuck it blank.
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome to Snatch Game.</i>
Let's meet our contestants.
A talented actor
who's spent more time in Barbra
Streisand's basement than she has.
Michael Urie!
-Hi, Michael.
-How are you?
Good to see you.
And all's fair in love and war
with the real Miss Tamar Braxton.
Are you ready to meet our stars?
{\an8}Let's go.
{\an8}Our first star is drag superstar
from the House of Haunt,
{\an8}Sharon Needles.
{\an8}Have you been to any good séances lately?
{\an8}I just got back from one.
{\an8}[dramatic music]
{\an8}[chuckles]
{\an8}All right, down to our next star.
This Cosby kid is all grown-up.
{\an8}Welcome Raven-Symoné.
{\an8}-I just had a vision.
-Really?
{\an8}-I'm a lesbian now.
-[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness!
{\an8}-That's so Raven.
-That is so me.
{\an8}Next up, financial adviser Suze Orman.
{\an8}Hello, my darling dear
little chickadee RuPaul.
{\an8}Now, Suze,
I make $8 an hour hosting this show.
{\an8}-Can I afford a yacht?
-How about a little rubber ducky?
{\an8}I'll throw in
a hot bag of nickels just in case.
{\an8}You've got a deal!
{\an8}Now, from the hit web series
<i>Alyssa's Secret,</i>
{\an8}-Alyssa Edwards!
-[pops tongue]
{\an8}I'm Alyssa Edwards, and this...
is Snatch Game.
I've always wanted to ask you,
what is your secret?
{\an8}-I'm sitting on it.
-[RuPaul] Oh, okay.
{\an8}[cackles]
{\an8}-[Violet] Almost got me there, bitch.
-Oh, good to know.
{\an8}From the Genovese crime family,
it's Big Ang!
{\an8}Hi, RuPaul. I'm feeling very excited.
{\an8}-What is your bra size?
-It's a medical mystery.
From the House of Versace,
it's Donatella Versace.
{\an8}Donatella Versace how's them boots?
How are you?
I'm doing great. Is it pronounced
"Ver-sayz" or "Ver-sa-chi"?
{\an8}It depends on where you come from.
I would have had an Italian accent
instead of a Russian accent.
{\an8}I don't mind.
But... hey.
{\an8}Good golly, Miss Molly!
It's rock and roll legend Little Richard.
{\an8}Are you feeling a little more tutti
or a little more frutti?
{\an8}A little more tutti, baby!
{\an8}[holds a note]
{\an8}Shut up.
{\an8}Last but not least,
music superstar Adele is here.
{\an8}-Hey, girl!
-Could I buy vowels?
{\an8}-What is that, darling?
-No whammies!
{\an8}No, this is the wrong show.
{\an8}Okay.
{\an8}Are you ready to play the Snatch Game?
{\an8}[Kennedy] <i>It's time for Snatch Game!</i>
Whooo!
Shut up.
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome back to</i> <i>Snatch Game.</i>
{\an8}Here's how the game works.
I ask a question, you give an answer
{\an8}that you think will match
our celebrity contestants'.
First question is
for the beautiful Tamar Braxton.
{\an8}Quentin Tarantino is remaking
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> as an action movie.
{\an8}In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}-All right, Tamar.
-She kills him, okay? Good-bye.
{\an8}Now let's go to our stars and hear
what they have to say. Big Ang?
{\an8}You know what, in my family,
we like to do it the old-fashioned way.
{\an8}You gut 'em like a fish.
-That's a match!
-Yes. Ding, ding, ding!
{\an8}-Big Ang!
-Yeah! Yeah!
{\an8}Financial adviser Suze Orman.
In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}Of course she bangs him,
{\an8}which is what I'd like to do
to most of these women here on stage.
{\an8}Except for this one down here,
Miss Donatella.
{\an8}She looks like a skeleton
made out of beef jerky.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}I love you, Justin Bieber.
{\an8}Let's move on down
to rock and roll royalty.
{\an8}Little Richard!
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}She tightens the screws.
{\an8}'Cause we all love a tight screw. A-whoo!
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Sorry, that is not a match.
-Shut up.
{\an8}[Kennedy] Whoo!
{\an8}Raven-Symoné. That's so Raven!
{\an8}-I just saw it.
-What is it?
{\an8}-She blows him.
-Unfortunately, that is not a match.
{\an8}I'll try again.
{\an8}-No, I saw the same thing.
-Same thing?
{\an8}Let's move on down here to Adele.
{\an8}-Where in England are you from?
-My house.
{\an8}-All right. Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
-Well, if it was me,
{\an8}I would say she rips out his heart
and then sings a whole album about it
{\an8}and gets really popular, but...
{\an8}-it's not me.
-No, no.
{\an8}So I said she polishes his chrome.
It's a good answer, but not a match.
{\an8}Well, could I get a match, please?
It's a fake cigarette.
All right, Donatella Versace.
{\an8}This is not
a doctor prescription refill card?
{\an8}I must be confused.
{\an8}But I did say,
"Hose down Versace boots," eh?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Interesting answer.
{\an8}Honey, that wig was a bad investment.
That's read.
All right, this one's for Michael.
{\an8}Rumor has it that they're making
a gay version of <i>Batman &amp; Robin.</i>
In this movie, the dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a "blank".
-A bed &amp; breakfast.
-I would stay there.
-I would too.
-Let's go to Sharon Needles.
{\an8}I said haunted house!
{\an8}[RuPaul] I'm sorry, but not a match.
{\an8}Moving on down to Raven-Symoné.
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...
{\an8}Weave shop!
{\an8}Oh, Jaidynn, I just got a vision.
You might be lip-syncing
for your life tomorrow, baby.
{\an8}I'm sorry, raven.
Moving on down to Suze Orman.
{\an8}I was looking over here at Big Ang,
and I thought of a foreclosed mobile home.
{\an8}You know what, that's fucked up.
{\an8}[RuPaul] All right, Alyssa Edwards.
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...
{\an8}A dance studio, baby.
Hashtag, beyond belief.
{\an8}Not a match, but a nice plug
for your dance studio.
{\an8}-All right, Big Ang.
-Well, I don't know
{\an8}about Batman and Robin,
but I love money, yacht, and mansions.
-Mansion.
-It's underneath a mansion.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] It is.
-I had a rough childhood.
{\an8}I wasn't watching
fucking <i>Batman and Robin.</i>
What say you, Little Richard.
{\an8}You know, me and Batman and Robin
have a lot in common, baby.
{\an8}I said a bathhouse
in a dark room with glory holes.
{\an8}There'll be a lot of singing
going on up in there, honey. Whooo!
I'm sorry, Little Richard.
That is not a match.
{\an8}Shut up.
{\an8}Next question is for Tamar Braxton.
{\an8}Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.
I'm gonna have to say coins,
honey, makes them laugh.
-Even her coins.
-They so rich they pee pennies.
Pssh, pennies.
Let's go over here to Sharon Needles.
{\an8}I said temper tantrums.
{\an8}-You know why?
-Why?
{\an8}Because Ellen never has temper tantrums.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Wait a minute.
{\an8}Her temper tantrums make her laugh
because Ellen does not have them.
{\an8}She does, but everything she says
is so damn funny. You can't even tell.
{\an8}Not a match for Tamar. All right, Adele.
{\an8}Adele, how much food
do you have down there, girl?
{\an8}-Smorgasbord.
-I have low sugar.
-[RuPaul] Low sugar.
-[Ginger] I do.
{\an8}She's using my EBT card.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Oh, Lord!
-[Kennedy] Whooo!
{\an8}-Oooh!
-Wrong note, sugar.
Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.
{\an8}Sad, sad tears of a clown.
-Like the Smokey Robinson song.
-Yeah.
{\an8}I'm so sorry, Adele. That is not a match.
{\an8}-But it's a song.
-[RuPaul] It is a song, but--
{\an8}-Did I sing it?
-[RuPaul] No, you didn't.
{\an8}So it's not a good song.
{\an8}Probably still won an award for it anyway.
[RuPaul] Probably, yes.
Oh, my stars! Time is up.
Which means our winner is...
{\an8}my therapist.
{\an8}We'll be tweeting more questions
@RuPaulsDragRace.
{\an8}So you can keep on playing at home.
-Say good night, stars!
-Good night, stars!
[RuPaul] See you next time
on the Snatch Game! Bye-ee!
{\an8}Child!
{\an8}Sir, what do you want me to do today?
{\an8}It's time for another elimination,
and people are really feeling the pressure
because there's only a handful of us left.
{\an8}[Katya]<i> </i>I'm second-guessing myself
about my performance.
<i>I don't know where I stand</i>
<i>in the eyes of the judges.</i>
All I can hear is the voices in my head
telling me how terrible I am.
-Can I talk to you?
-I'd love to.
Okay.
What's going on?
I am kind of freaking out.
I've been completely sober
for the past year and a half.
Most of the time, I'm fine. But being away
from my support network has been brutal.<i> </i>
I know that Fame is sober, so she's
the only other person who can understand
exactly what I'm going through.
-How long have you been sober for?
-For nine years,
but counting days in here
feels like being a newcomer.
That's exactly what it feels like!
Like, it's hard.
-I've never seen that of you.
-I'm pretty good at hiding it.
-I am terrified of failure.
-Yeah.
And my sense of humor is just, like...
-It's been a smoke screen for that.
-Yeah.
And I have to tell you,
the first day I came in here,
the first thing I thought of was,
"You don't belong here.
You're not good enough."
I didn't realize how badly...
I've actually never been able
to love myself, and it's like...
You are, love. You are loved.
I'm having to deal
with the insecurities I don't wanna face,
and I did not expect that.
You're being so hard on yourself.
You're in it, but you're not alone.
I'm here with you,
having the same fears and feelings.
My character defects are on fire,
and people are seeing me,
and they're like, "Girl talks a lot."
That's my obsessive mind running!
{\an8}There's a lot that I'm relating
with Katya on an emotional level.
To connect and let go of those fears
makes me feel stronger.
This moment is what I needed.
-I needed it too.
-Thank you so much.
-Let's go put some war paint--
-I'm Miss Fame, and I'm an alcoholic.
My name is Katarina Zamolodchikova,
and I'm a drug addict and alcoholic. Ugh!
After my talk with Fame,
I feel like a weight has been lifted.
-Oh, God!
-I can't go back!
Let's go paint.

Violet Chachki.
Pearl.
You are both...
...safe.
You may leave the stage.
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
Starting with Ginger Minj.
I thought you were truly brilliant
as Adele.
You never left character,
and it was a complete transformation.
Today, you owned being thickums.
It was like, "This is me, eat it."
The only thing that I would change
is your hair is a little too triangular.
I was trying to do
like an Elvis "Prissley"
-kind of thing.
-I would've gone all the way.
-I usually do.
-I heard that about you.
I'm the one that wrote it
on the bathroom wall.
-[RuPaul] Next up, Miss Fame.
-You look stunning.
It's not '40s, it's something different.
And that's really refreshing.
Snatch Game. You had so many
missed opportunities, and I wanted more.
It felt like you were 20% there.
You'll never have this opportunity again.
Be here in the present,
and don't let this moment pass you by.
All right. Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy.
I am not a fan of anybody
doing boy drag. You know this.
You killed it.
I was like, "Who let
meetratchetpeople.com in here? What?"
But you gave me all the light
that I needed yesterday.
I didn't expect this risk from you.
You're my pageant queen.
I'm not always head to toe.
I like to get messy too.
-Oh, okay.
-And this gown, I would climb you.
-Oh!
-[RuPaul laughs]
-Can we go to break?
-Shut up.
-[RuPaul] Next up, Max.
-Thank you for the new hair color.
You know what I miss?
Is the gray hair. You look fantastic,
but I think you look normal.
[Michelle] Snatch Game.
You had the look down 100%.
What was missing was everything else.
Sharon's got a twisted sense of humor,
and that was missing,
-and I hate to say--
-It looks like Max is coming apart.
Yeah, I just really needed
to loosen the corset.
-Okay.
-I apologize.
Can we get some help for Max?
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>Oh, bitch, here we go.</i>
{\an8}Cue the dramatics.
You can tell she's an actress.
-Max, are you okay?
-♪ <i>So I can't quite recall</i> ♪
♪ <i>All the night's sensation</i> ♪
I took advantage of the moment.
[Miss Fame] <i>Is this a strategy?</i>
{\an8}Because this is one of the first times
that she's not been a shining star.
-Yes.
-[exhales]
-Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Tamar] Today...
I'm still trying to put it all together,
the look. Somehow, it just...
falls flat.
As far as being Raven-Symoné,
it became real like,
"Okay, she's gonna see a vision."
Once, it was funny.
The second time, it was cute.
The rest of the time, it died.
[RuPaul] Next up, Katya.
To go from Suze Orman
to Xena the Warrior Princess,
you look so beautiful and...
I'm losing my train of thought.
You really strutted your stuff,
and you were like Britney at 45.
And yesterday was just "hilarical", okay?
I really laughed the whole...
I just wanted even more.
I know I'm always asking for more,
but y'all can take it further, so push it.
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will braid
each other's hair.
Oh, fun!
You may leave the stage.
Just between us squirrel friends,
let's talk about Ginger Minj.
She chose a character
that was creative and also challenging.
She came out in all white,
and everybody was in all black.
<i>Only superstars know</i>
<i>to do things like that.</i>
-There's no cons.
-No cons.
I bet there's been a con in her
-once or twice, you know.
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
She looked the part of Donatella,
but she didn't deliver comedy.
She's not breaking through.
She doesn't feel solid in herself.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-[Michael] The way that she walked,
<i>look at the spot she would stand in,</i>
<i>even point at the spot,</i>
and then circle it and leave it
and not even stop.
And then Snatch Game,
it was such an over-the-top caricature.
It just worked.
The giant Bea Arthur shoulder pads.
-The lip gloss.
-[Tamar] <i>She changed Little Richard.</i>
She killed it for me.
-[RuPaul] <i>Next up is Max.</i>
-When she came in looking so great,
and then there was no characterization,
that was a real bummer for me.
Max likes to stay in a comfort zone.
I think that Max has more potential.
She just needs to find it.
-[RuPaul] <i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce.</i>
-The Snatch Game was one note.
-I was over it... dot com.
-Okay.
If I'm on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
don't come as Chaka's little sister.
You come as Chaka.
-That's all she has to say about that.
-Okay.
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-Her Suze Orman was spot-on.
I understand that it didn't go full-tilt,
but I loved it.
Like, she gave me futuristic
Britney Spears tee-hee-hee, honey,
and Whitesnake tee-hee,
and, you know, Guns N' Roses.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girlses.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Katya.
You're safe.
Kennedy Davenport. Great gosh almighty.
You rocked the Snatch Game.
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
Thank you.
{\an8}I won another challenge. Yay!
Ginger Minj, your Adele
had us rolling in the aisles.
Condragulations, you are also
the winner of this week's challenge.
That's right, ladies. First tie
in Snatch Game herstory.
{\an8}I won! If there was ever
a challenge to win, it is this one.
[RuPaul] <i>You've both won fabulous</i>
<i>feather accoutrements from Mother Plucker.</i>
You may join the other girls.
Ebony and ivory.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, your vision
of Miss Symoné was not so Raven.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Miss Fame, "don't-a-tella" me
that was your best impersonation.
Max, your Sharon Needles missed the point.
Max...
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}[Max] <i>Damn, damn, damn!</i>
{\an8}I can't get over the feelings in my head
of disappointment in myself.
{\an8}It's really sort of overwhelming.
Miss Fame, you may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life!
{\an8}I can't go home. I refuse.
I gotta protect my spot here.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

Max, you are a true original.
Thank you for taking us all to the max.
Now, sashay away.
[Max] <i>I was able to represent myself.</i>
<i>I stayed as classy as I possibly could.</i>
I feel like I've been in a dream.
For me to go back to Kansas from Oz,
it's all so surreal.
But there's no place like home.
My seven sisters,
I have a confession to make.
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.
That I've let one of the eliminated queens
go home... too soon.
{\an8}Ru, girl, what?
{\an8}I'm just not sure which one.
Could it be Tempest DuJour,
{\an8}<i>Sasha Belle,</i>
<i>Jasmine Masters, Trixie Mattel,</i>
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis, Kandy Ho, or Max?</i>
{\an8}Ah, shit.
{\an8}No, no, no!

{\an8}But it doesn't count. She's gone. Next.
-Goodbye, Sasha. We love you.
-We love you, Sasha.
{\an8}This week, I survived by the skin
of my fucking fingernails.
It was the most stressful thing
I've ever done.
I'm gonna fucking murder
that next challenge, whatever it is.
Get me out of this shit.
I'm so happy to be out of these heels.
[grunts]
We got good feedback and recognition
for our group, girl.
It was very well-deserved.
I already knew when they picked the group
that it would be weaker.
When they picked that group,
I knew it was buffoonery,
because they all look alike. They're all
the same height and weigh two pounds.
{\an8}Fame, Trixie, Pearl. Then there's that old
tight-ass, long horse-face Violet.
Them four just rub my nerves out.
All they want to do is talk and walk
their asses in heels, that's not drag.
Y'all sashay away. [laughs]
Get your asses up out of here.
I don't like shit about them hoes.
Not the air they breathe, not their
bony-ass, slim, up-and-down pole bodies.
I would love to send all them

{\an8}The two winners
of today's mini challenge are...
{\an8}Max and Kennedy Davenport.
Plinko!
We'll be posting these gifs at logotv.com
so grandma and them can see them too.
Now ladies...
The word "drag"
was first used by Shakespeare
as an acronym for "dressed as a girl."
Back when, you know,
all the female roles were played by men.
For this week's Maxi Challenge,
you'll be acting in a comedic adaptation
{\an8}of two Shakespeare classics.
<i>Romy &amp; Juliet.</i>
{\an8}And my favorite, <i>MacBitch</i>.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Hashtag Shakesqueer.
{\an8}Now, Max and Kennedy,
you get to pick your castmates
and assign the roles. Max, you pick first.
Ginger Minj.
Come here, you little comedian.
Jasmine.
Trixie Mattel. [clicks tongue]
Katya.
Mrs. Kasha Davis. Get over here, girl.
Pearl.
Jaidynn. Get over here as fast as you can.
Kandy.
That leaves Miss Fame and Violet.
Max, who do you want on your team?
-Fame.
-My mothballs are on fire.
Which means Violet Chachki
is on Team Kennedy Davenport.
{\an8}I have no idea
why I'm getting picked last again.
Now, in a moment, Michelle Visage and I
will meet you on set
to direct your shoot.
Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is Bearded and Beautiful.
Gentlemen, start thine engines,
and may the best woman winneth.
{\an8}Let's see what this <i>MacBitch</i> is about.
{\an8}So we get MacBitch,
a crazy cheerleader parody of <i>Macbeth</i>.
{\an8}I've never even seen...
What is the original name? Mc...
{\an8}-[producer] <i>Macbeth</i>.
-<i>Macbeth</i>?
I don't even know what <i>Macbeth</i> is,
honestly. Call me young. Call me,
like, illiterate. Whatever.
I've never seen <i>Macbeth</i>.
Okay. I think I'm ready to assign.
Lady MacBitch, the pretty one,
the ambitious, ruthless wannabe mean girl.
That sounds like Violet.
[laughter]
Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. [laughs]
-The tough ghetto woman.
-I don't want to be the ghetto girl.
Because that's, like, so common. I could
really turn myself into Lady MacBitch.
-Lady MacBitch?
-Yes.
I kind of don't want
to put people in their, like...
-Comfort zone?
-Yeah.
So, Violet, I would like
for you to be ghetto.
We have an hour to get this down,
so we need to figure it out.
Yeah, it's figured out.
You Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. Okay?
Her and Jasmine are friends, that's why
Jasmine has the role of MacBitch,
even though it is perfect for me.
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, Boo-boo.
<i>There's no pleasing Violet</i>
<i>if it doesn't go her way.</i>
She always has a stank face.
She's just a bitch.
{\an8}So this is some Shakespeare shit.
{\an8}This week's main challenge is to act
{\an8}in a new adaptation
of a Shakespearian classic.
I'm so excited.
I've done Shakespeare plenty...
and he liked it every time.
[Max] <i>We got </i>Romy and Juliet
<i>and I'm excited.</i>
{\an8}I do have, like,
some legitimate Shakespearian experience.
-So let's go through the characters.
-Do you have a 30-day trial?
Attention, please. Everyone, when I have
my hands up like this, attention.
All right, kittens. Lady Cappuccino,
Juliet's drag mother, a little older.
-I think I know who that one sounds like.
-[laughs]
Juliet's BFF, a vapid, ditsy party girl.
Let's see how many lines she has,
then we'll talk.
Mercutia, she's more ratchet,
kind of a hoochie.
-See, I think you should be Mercutia.
-Come on, house...
-Capulet. Is that correct?
-House Capulet, yeah.
-Capu... Capulet.
-Capulet. Exactly.
I don't know what that means.
-You're, like, totes montage-eau.
-Montague.
Monta-goo.
{\an8}Some of these girls look like
their Shakespeare is gonna be shaky, dear.
Montag-ew!
Ew!
{\an8}This is so not your gig.
{\an8}When you go:
"This is so not your gig," you be like...
-So not your gig.
-This is so... not your gig.
Sound like more Regina George.
{\an8}Jasmine has the role of MacBitch
and it's, like, a really sassy, bitchy...
This is so not your gig.
She's not really serving that.
Basic bitches not wanted.
I get the ghetto girl
and I'm serving it well.
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanni. That's right.
The struggle is real. Um...
I want to make a judgment call here
because I just don't feel comfortable.
I need Jasmine and Violet
to switch characters.
Jasmine, just be the ghetto girl
and make it work.
Bitch, I already gone done
filled my ghetto fantasy.
Let's switch scripts.
So because of Jasmine's fucking up
we should change quick?
We should definitely
run through it right now.
No, no. Just read on your own.
<i>So now, well into our challenge,</i>
<i>Jasmine and Violet</i>
{\an8}have to learn new parts.
Now it's just a race against time.
{\an8}[Renaissance music playing]
{\an8}Team Max. Welcome.
{\an8}It is time to showcase
our "Shakesqueerian" play,
<i>and my team better know their lines.</i>
But in case they don't,
I know them for them.
-All right, you lipstick thesbians.
-Get it, guys. You got it.
-And action.
-[beep]
First day of school.
House of Caparus is gonna rule.
-Capulet.
-Fuck! Sorry.
-All right. Action!
-[beep]
Soft, but what light do break?
I'm Juliet,
but you can call me Cupcake. Hey!
Ho! You two have to chill.
You're from enemy crews!
-"Romy? You'll get yourself banished."
-Oh.
Romy, you'll get yourself banished...
if you hang with that flooz.
I'm sorry, I need to relax.
Mercutia, what's going on?
I'm not really experienced in acting.
I'm giving it the best...
Girl, you are a drag queen.
You are experienced at acting.
Okay.
What's going on, Jaidynn?
What's happening?
I just... [sobs] I get in the moment
and I just kind of freak out.
I want this so bad and...
I'm sorry. [sniffles]
I just... [sobs]
{\an8}Jaidynn begins to tear up and it all
sort of comes down on her at once.
-I got this.
-Yes, girl.
-You got this.
-Shake it off!
-Shake it off!
-Yeah.
So we're gonna do it one more time.
Romy, girl! You was my sister!
Why?
Ladies, uh, we're done.
-That's a wrap.
-Thank you.
{\an8}It's unfortunate because, had Jaidynn been
a little bit more confident and prepared,
<i>we could've really nailed it.</i>
And now, I'm thinking,
she may have just lost it for us.
{\an8}[RuPaul] The cast of <i>MacBitch</i>.
Places, people. Places, people.
Let's make magic.
Yes.
-Action!
-[beep]
Friends, drag queens, hunty men.
Cheerleader tryouts are happening today.
Uh, cut. Pearl, is that your normal voice?
-No, I deepened it a bit...
-You deepened it.
-...for the character.
-You shouldn't do that.
You are the narrator of this thing.
-Everyone will look at you.
-Okay.
With that lame-ass whistle.
Hey, Hogwarts rejects,
what's your prediction?
-"The spirit."
-The spirits
[both speaking] have spoken.
We saw it in a dream.
-[both] Lady MacBitch is the...
-[Kandy Ho] New cheer supreme.
[beep]
Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna.
-Oh.
-"Head cheerleader."
Head... Head cheerleader... Oh, fuck!
Head cheerleader is gonna be me. Ki...
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanni.
-Cut. It's about that rhyme.
-It's really a rhythm.
It's: "Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna.
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanna."
Watch out, sisters. I'm prim... Oh!
Keep going.
Watch out, sisters. I'm the queen...
I'm the real prima donna.
Head coach is gonna... Head cheerleader
is gonna be me, Laquisha Quian... Fuck!
So we're gonna move on.
{\an8}Oh, my God. I'm like...
like when is this gonna be over?
-Okay, here we go.
-[beep]
Tastes like burning...
[Renaissance music playing]
Basic witches not wanted.
-What is happening?
-I'm lost.
[Katya] <i>It was a domino effect. One</i>
<i>screwed up, then another screwed up</i>
<i>and then this person doesn't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>
It's a mess.
Kennedy, did you rehearse your team?
I got to tell you, in seven seasons
of doing <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
I have never seen
a car crash like this before.
I don't know what to tell you, ladies.
This is not good.
Everybody on my team
is in deep shit right now.
[gunshot]
{\an8}You ready for another day in paradise?
{\an8}It's elimination day and I'm feeling
horrible. Yesterday, my team sucked.
{\an8}Worst day of my life.
Like, someone bring me a puppy.
{\an8}I want to die.
-How we doing, Miss Jasmine?
-You know, I don't like to be, like,
-I don't know my shit.
-Right.
So it was just like, fuck!
I think you just need
to turn that gown out and give it to them.
{\an8}I was part of a team that was the worst
in the whole entire history
<i>of Drag Race. But I know for a fact</i>
this dress is the best gown that ever
walked down the runway of a drag race.
I wouldn't be surprised if Ru got up
and said: "Bitch,
just because of that gown, girl,
you're safe as fuck."
[laughs] Who the hell are you?
I say: "I'm Trixie Mattel."
And they say: "Who?"
-They're like: "Who?"
-Right, yeah.
Yes!
These young girls
ain't been through nothing. And, girl,
it's getting on my nerves.
You have to discover
what your aesthetic is.
{\an8}Girl. Please, honey. Find one.
[laughter]
-They don't even know who they are yet.
-They don't.
-What's that color one?
-What? Oh, Violet.
-Yeah, that one.
-Lavender.
Tacky drag.
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis, Jasmine,</i>
<i>Kennedy and myself,</i>
{\an8}we just call ourselves
the bitter old lady brigade.
But we don't mean any harm, girl.
Except when we do.
It worries me,
the younger ones don't get it.
And then they get hit hard
with what comes afterwards.
People tell me:
"Why do you take drag so seriously?
You're not curing cancer."
No, but I'm making it easier to live with.
-Right.
-This one woman came up
and we said: "What are you celebrating?"
She said: "My bucket list."
She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer
and wanted to go and see a drag show.
They gave her two weeks to live.
She came for a year.
And we were like: "You know, one day,
she's not gonna come." And she didn't.
We found out she'd been taken
to hospice, so we put together
the entire show, drove over to hospice,
and gave that girl one last show.
It's stuff like that makes it worthwhile.
Somebody needs that.
-Right.
-When you're on stage,
you're ministering somebody
in some type of way.
I just had a meltdown.
I broke down right there on stage,
crying, acting a fool.
And, honey, if I have to lip-synch,
I'm gonna give that my all,
because I didn't come here to go home.
{\an8}I worked so hard to get here.
This is my dreams and my goals.
Everything is at stake right now.
They'll need security,
escort me out, honey.
It will be a real drag show
because they'll drag me off the stage.
I ain't going home.
No ma'am, no ham, no cauliflower,
no corn bread, no green beans.
I'm not going home.

are you ready to tame some shrews?
-Bring me the shrews!

My favorite broke girl,

{\an8}-Kat Dennings is here.
-This is the best day of my life, Ru.
And the spiciest girl of all,
from <i>America's Got Talent</i>, Mel B.
{\an8}Welcome to my show,
<i>America's Got Drag Queens</i>.
I'm so bloody excited,
I cannot even tell you.
This week, we challenged our queens
to hamlet it up
in two twisted Shakespeare classics.
And tonight, they're ready to gag us
with the hair on their chinny chin chins.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best bearded woman win.

Welcome back, ladies.
It's time to debut
the greatest love story of all time,
<i>Romy and Juliet.</i>
Starring Team Max.
[Renaissance music playing]
In a world of charisma
uniqueness, talent, and nerve,
two rival drag houses
are gonna get on they swerve.
First day of school.
House of Capulet's gonna rule.
-Drag mother, who's there? Do you know?
-Juliet,
pay her no mind.
It's that skank Romy-ho.
-Soft, but what light do break?
-I'm Juliet,
but what's in a name?
You can call me Cupcake.
-Okay?
-[both gasping]
Oh, chill out, you two.
You're from enemy crews.
You'll get yourself banished
if you hang with this flooz.
What did you say? RuPaul-ogize, trolls.
Calm down, Beyoncé,
or I'll clock those back
-rolls.
-[all gasp]
<i>The queen-on-queen rumble</i>
<i>turned into a thriller.</i>
Meanwhile, later that night
at Juliet's villa...
-Wherefore art thou, Romy, yo!
-Be still, sweet Juliet.
But how is she, though?
-Romy, let's live forever.
-Do you fancy a shag?
Yes, god. On your eleganza
I gag! [gasps]
-[sniffs and gags]
-Oh, girl, you really gagging.
Oh, wait. Status update: dead.
There we go. [moans]
[gasps]
Oh, man. We never even got to kaikai.
And with this death drop, I do die.
[moans]
Romy, girl!
Why?
Teenage suicide...
Don't do it.
[sniffles] I just...
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[laughter]
Well done, ladies. Next up, <i>MacBitch</i>.
Starring Team Kennedy Davenport.
[Renaissance music playing]
Here in Tuckahoe,
it's the season of the witch... [sniffs]
but none are as shady as Lady MacBitch.
[laughter]
Friends, drag queens, hunty men.
[blows the whistle]
I got something to say.
Cheerleading tryouts are happening today.
Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanna. That's right!
Girl, not on tonight.
This is so not your gig.
I'm lady MacBitch
and you're a pig in a wig.
Hey, Hogwarts rejects,
what's your prediction?
If I'm not head cheerleader,
it's purely fan fiction.
The spirits have spoken.
We saw in a dream.
Lady MacBitch is the cheer team supreme.
Wicked, please.
Attention, cheer trolls.
Let the tryouts begin.
Start your engines.
May the best Tuckahoe win!
-Basic witches not wanted.
-Oh, sisters, I'm stressed.
If I don't win, I may die.
Try this. It'll help.
It's Oprah's new chai.
[whispering] With a shot of drain cleaner.
Well, all right, Mary MacBitch.
Give it a go. You're up first.
Okay. Give me a T. Give me a U.
Give me a...
[gags]
Byeeeee!
[blows the whistle]
U-G-L-Y. You ain't got no alibi. You ugly.
Tragic.
[dramatic music playing]
Well, there you have it, ladies,
master-queef theater.
{\an8}It was hard to watch.
I'm trying to black it out.
The reviews are in, and one production
are all safe from elimination.
Team Max, condragulations.
-Good work, guys.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
-kudos for working through your fears.
-Thank you, Ru.
And for your dual role as team leader
and the tallest Juliet in herstory,
Max, you are the winner
of the challenge.
[applause]
You've won two couture latex outfits
<i>from Syren Latex,</i>
<i>a leader in latex fashions.</i>
{\an8}This is the perfect ending
to a good week. It feels grand.
Now, get thee to a nunnery.
[electronic music playing]
Team Kennedy Davenport,
you are all up for elimination.
-First up, Kennedy.
-I have to say, the runway outfit
is probably my least favorite
of all of the contestants.
-Oh!
-Your performance...
the fact that you were the team leader
and your team was a disaster.
-What the hell happened?
-It was a shock to me as well.
During your rehearsal,
couldn't you sense
-that it wasn't even going right?
-Nobody knew their lines.
Well, that was pretty evident.
-Moving on. Katya.
-You knew your lines.
You delivered it okay
and for this group, it's a lot.
Your choice on the runway
shows intelligent humor.
The hair, the beard,
the whole entire look...
-Flawless for me.
-Thank you.
All right, Jasmine Masters.
Oh, what a gorgeous gown!
-Thank you.
-You just look unbelievable,
and I'm sure the dress weighs 100 pounds.
-Yes, it does.
-Your beard is the most disturbing to me,
-and it looks like a chin strap.
-I don't glue stuff to my face.
The slightest thing will break me out.
I didn't want to take that chance
and put something on my face and going
to the hospital because my skin broke out.
Your Shakespearean performance wasn't fun
to watch, we could kind of see
-that you were having a hard time.
-I knew my lines,
but they didn't come out
how they should.
You did not know your lines.
Next up, Pearl.
Your look makes a statement,
and you're the only one
that used
some really creative materials.
You were a cheerleading coach,
and you were, like, lifeless
and borderline dead.
I like borderline dead. I find it great.
-Once.
-I've only seen it once.
I mean, it was rough.
The domino effect was real.
But you had the first word.
So if you have a domino effect,
you started it.
Yeah. Sorry. Thanks.
-Next up, Kandy Ho.
-Hello.
Yay on the contouring.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
You changed your face and it shows.
-Thank you.
-It's pretty, and now we see you.
-Isn't it funny?
-That's the irony, she wears a beard.
-For the beard challenge...
-She fixes her contour.
I liked the nerdy kind of twist you did
with the tape on the glasses.
-I think you did a fantastic job.
-Thank you.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
I love that Dior silhouette, girl.
You look very elegant and pretty,
and that's hard to do with a full beard.
[RuPaul laughs] Yeah.
Lady MacBitch just fell flat.
How can anyone be crap at being a bitch?
It was a hard day for everybody.
Why is everyone saying a rough day?
Haven't we had days when we just
have to pull it out
and just deal with it and be professional?
Um...
I'll say this. I specifically remember
turning to Kennedy
and saying: "Should we run it as a group?"
And she shot me down and said:
"No," and that was
the root of our problem.
I'll take responsibility as a leader.
But as far as taking correction,
I'm not gonna take their blame.
You know, FYI,
for all of you girls up there,
I don't want to hear any god damn excuses.
-Be prepared!
-We didn't have time to re-rehearse.
Make it work. Make it work.
Fucking make it happen! I don't want
to hear any goddamn excuses anymore!
[sighs]
Having said that, my children,
while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us, spice girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
It looked like she had some pubes
that she glued to her face
-and that was it.
-As a performer...
-Thesbian.
-As a thesp... thesbian...
-I heard that about you.
-What a mistake to not run
-the play as a group.
-It was a mess
from top to bottom.
I don't like messy bottoms.
[laughter]
-[Rupaul]<i> Katya.</i>
-She was consistently delivering.
I think she's always ready,
willing, and abe-le.
[laughs]
-[RuPaul]<i> Jasmine Masters.</i>
-As a fan of the show,
the biggest fan of all time,
it's so frustrating
<i>when you watch someone talented</i>
<i>get in their own way so much</i>
-and they can't pull out of it.
-You have to make it work.
Work. Work it out.
I don't know what it is,
but I really like Jasmine.
[RuPaul] All right.
Let's move on to Pearl.
Her role... I think she was trying
to be, like, a couture football player.
[Michelle] <i>The pants had</i>
<i>this gaping crotch that kept</i>
-grabbing my eyes.
-I saw that. Yeah.
Then, when her lines came,
it was like, "Hark.
-Who goes there?"
-[laughter]
This performance
brought to you by Lithium.
[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>
This will sound shocking,
but I actually enjoyed her hairy box.
-[laughter]
-[Carson] <i>Immensely.</i>
She did seem like one of the only people
having a good time.
-She's an enigma.
-Wait, what did you call me?
-[laughter]
-You better watch it.
-[RuPaul]<i> Violet Chachki.</i>
-I don't want to be a MacBitch about it.
However, she is the one
I remember the least.
Come on.
We can all be a bitch. She wasn't.
-Rude.
-[Michelle laughs]
Silence! I've made my decision.
Bring back my shakes-beards.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kandy Ho...
You're safe.
Katya...
-You're safe, Mr. President.
-[whispers] Thank you.
Jasmine Masters,
your Shakespeare performance
was a tragedy.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki...
-You're safe.
-Thank you.
Kennedy Davenport, you were team leader,
and heavy is the head
that wears the crown.
Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.
Consider tonight your wake-up call.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
Pearl...
You're safe.
[dramatic music playing]
Kennedy, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}I don't want to go up against Jasmine.
That's my sister.
You know, we have a bond.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself...
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch for your life.

No.

Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
Tempest DuJour, sashay away.

{\an8}I need to show the judges
that I do have what it takes.
Well, condragulations, girl.
{\an8}-How does that feel?
-I hate Michelle Visage.
-What?
-Girl.
What she said
just rubbed me the wrong way.
I would have liked to see it
zhooshed a little 'cause I'm getting boy.
She probably has a bigger man body
than I do without her implants.
[Jasmine] Don't go there, girl.
{\an8}Of course Michelle Visage
is gonna judge you. It's her job.
You'll get negative criticism
no matter what.
[Violet] It wasn't tasteful.
It was like, "Ew, Michelle."
{\an8}Michelle seems underwhelmed
with what I was doing,
{\an8}<i>but I impressed myself.</i>
{\an8}[blows raspberry]
-I thought you was gonna win.
-I mean, there has to be a winner,
and I think that your win was valid.
I stand by that.
-I'm not sitting here mad about it.
-A little bit.
{\an8}Did the judges get it right?
<i>Pause, pause, pause.</i>
Maybe not.
-[Kandy] Well, congratulations, girl.
-[Violet] Oh, girl, yes.
Are you mad at me?
{\an8}Tonight, Sasha threw me
under the bus on the stage.
Which queen
has least impressed you thus far?
I'd have to say Pearl.
I expect to be hated on.
I wasn't expecting it so soon,
because she's been cool
to my face the whole time.
-Whatever. It's all good.
-Well, obviously it's not.
Half of me saying Pearl's name
was strategy
because Pearl is
one of my biggest competitors,
and half of it was 'cause she acts
like she doesn't want to be here.
I get it. You're playing the game.
-You should be.
-I don't want an evil game,
-but I'm--
-Whatever.
Okay, well, never mind.

-Hi.
Condragulations, ladies.
For today's mini challenge,
you need to give face, face, face,
while the pit crew blows you.
With a leaf blower.
-[Jasmine] Damn.
-[RuPaul] Oh, pit crew.
[Ginger] Girl, I'm from Florida.
I have survived many a hurricane,

You have 15 minutes to get into drags.
Ready, set, go.

We're never gonna pick up
hot men looking like this.
[RuPaul] All right, time's up, ladies.
Now, to help judge today's mini challenge,
give a big drag-race welcome
{\an8}to my good friend, music superstar Moby.
{\an8}Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello, my darling.
Look at all these beautiful people.
Hi, everybody.
I feel short and homeless next to you.
Well, and rightfully so.
All right, ladies, show of hands.
Who wants to get blown first?
[RuPaul] Pit crew,
let it rip.

Wow.
I think that's the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.
The two winners
of today's mini challenge are...
Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel.
Condragulations, ladies.
We'll be posting these gifs
at logotv.com.
Now, for this week's maxi challenge,
get ready for a lip sync-a-palooza,
as you'll be performing
a mashup of spoken word and song,
{\an8}the safety preflight video
for #GlamazonianAirways,
the first airlines
run completely by drag queens.
You'll be working in two teams.
Ginger and Trixie,
since you won the mini challenge,
you get to pick the crews
and assign the parts.
-Ginger, you pick first.
-I'll take Sasha Belle.
Yes!
I'm a Pearl girl.
[Ginger] Take Miss Jasmine.
-Miss Lame.
-Hi, boo.
-Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-Thank you, darling.
-Miss Katya.
-Yes.
-Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Well, Ru, I'm all Maxed out.
-Yes.
[Ginger] I'll take
Miss Kennedy Davenport.
[RuPaul] That leaves
Violet and Kandy Ho.
[Violet] <i>I won the first challenge,</i>
so I don't really understand
why they are not choosing me.
Violet.
Which means, Kandy Ho,
you're on Ginger's team.
[Kandy] <i>What the hell?</i>
You're underestimating what I can do.
I've got to catch a flight,
so I'm gonna make this really quick.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-See ya!
-Bye.
Here's part one,
so we can all listen together.
-Does anyone lip-sync extremely well?
-Duh.
For the first part, where it's two girls
who start singing together,
I think you guys should look like--
We got to figure it out soon, because--
Should we all just listen?
Because when we're talking,
we're not what? Listening.
{\an8}Violet has been rubbing me
the wrong way.
Whatever you say,
she needs to snap back at you,
and it's like, "All right,
public school. Calm down."
Is anybody not a dancer at all?
I'm not not a dancer,
but I'm not a dancer.
So are you a dancer?
There's definitely
a tense sort of air with Violet
<i>that can have an effect</i>
<i>on our energy as a group.</i>
Positive energies, positive energies,
positive energies.
Yeesh!
{\an8}[Ginger] We should listen to it,
kind of get an idea,
{\an8}-and then we'll assign parts.
-[Jasmine] Yeah.
{\an8}Our challenge this week
is to do a live lip sync
<i>in front of the judges with choreography.</i>
This is right on my alley.
What'll make the first part pop
when we're all singing together,
we should get our vowel movement...
Our vowel movements synced up.
So I'll be 7, so I could do
the thing about the padded ass.
My pants are out to here.
I think 13 and 11 should be
Jasmine and Kennedy.
[Jasmine] I'm down.
♪ <i>Wee da-ba-de-do, da-ba-de-do,</i>
<i>da-ba-de-do, da-ba-de-do...</i> ♪
-I like the scat.
-I bet you do.
I think looks-wise,
I want to have you do the scat thing.
Are there any questions about that?
Let's try one more again.
{\an8}Ginger gives the scat part to Kasha.
-And you could be... twelve.
-Twelve.
I think I'm most concerned about
having such a small part.
{\an8}[Kasha] Sasha doesn't like the role
that she's been cast. She's meh.
{\an8}[scoffs]
{\an8}Exhausting.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hi.
-So, Ginger, you're the leader.
-Uh-huh.
What made you pick this team?
I wanted to go for a team
that was not only talented,
but also very diverse.
If you look at the other team,
they look like Aryan Airlines.
[laughter]
Now, has any of you girls
not done spoken-word lip-syncing?
-I don't think I have.
-You have not?
You don't think you have?
Okay. All right.
Did you assign the parts,
or did you let your team choose
what they wanted to do?
I assigned them.
I made sure everybody
was comfortable with their role
because I want everybody
to be able to express themselves.
-What are you most worried about?
-Well, I'm not a dancer.
I'm gonna throw that out there now.
If I fall, y'all better not showgirls me.
You better pick me up.
{\an8}To be the one who is leading
this team in a dance number...
All right, get to it.
...if something goes down,
I'm going down with it.
-[RuPaul] Hey, ladies.
-[all] Hi, Ru.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-So, Trixie, you're our team leader.
-An amazing team.
-You have a theater background.
-Yeah. This is my gig.
And any other girls
have acting experience?
-Miss Fame, any acting?
-Not yet.
I've had some opportunities
that could be considered
an entryway to acting,
but not to the degree that I'd like to see
my future evolve into.
You just described a Craigslist ad.
{\an8}I'm worried about Fame because
she has hardly any performing experience,
{\an8}so she looks amazing,
but can she deliver on stage?
Katya, don't you have a dance background?
A little bit. I wouldn't call myself
a "dancer," per se,
but I can move my body
in a compelling way.
Usually it compels people
to leave the room but...
-All right, get to work.
-Thank you.
All right, gather round,
sexy stewardesses. Gather round.
In a moment, you'll meet
with choreographer Jamal Sims.
So I expect your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
to be on fire!
Don't fuck it up. All right, bye.
[dance music playing]
{\an8}-Ladies.
-[Violet] Hi.
How's everybody doing?
Marvelous.
-Who's queen one?
-That's me.
You have your whole speech?
The first thing that I'm freaking out
about is, of course,
memorizing my lines.
-And let's go.
-Welcome aboard, welcome aboard.
[mumbling]
I have a fucking monologue.
I'm the first impression.
I'm the first part of this group.
If I fuck it up, I could go home.
[Jamal] Violet, you're gonna come center,
and then when you say,
"They're there to make you skinny,"
you're gonna take it and tighter
all the way around her,
and you're, like, "It is skinny."
All right, here we go.
♪ <i>It's gonna be pulled real tight</i>
<i>Real tight, real tight, real tight, go!</i> ♪
[Jamal] Everybody sing.
♪ <i>Tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter...</i> ♪
-[Jamal] Okay.
-[Violet] Bitch, pull it tight.
Get it right on that waist.
{\an8}I have the smallest waist
in <i>Drag Race</i> history.
<i>I want people to see it.</i>
[Violet] Really tighten it.
[Pearl] I don't have time to tighten it
all the way, run around you,
and tuck it into your belt.
Tighten it all the way.
{\an8}Don't tell me what to do
and don't get an attitude with me.
You're not the only one
dancing on the stage right now.
[Jamal] Pearl and Miss Fame, take center.
Can I put this in the pocket while we...
I'm just trying to take this all in.
{\an8}I'm feeling a little bit nervous.
<i>I can dance at the club</i>
<i>and get a husband,</i>
but I don't...
I'm not a choreograph dancer.
[Jamal] All right, you guys go
shake, shake, shake.
So booty, booty, booty, booty.
Five, six, seven, eight, hit.
[Miss Fame] Oh, lost it.
So Miss Fame, her execution is so bad.
There's no rhythm. There's no musicality.
-Just that, that, that.
-Like that?
Her hips don't move
like a woman's hip should move.
[Jamal] "There are two in the front
and only one in the..."
Uh-oh. Something happened here.
{\an8}Pearl and Fame are not together,
{\an8}and neither are doing
the choreo correctly, which is bad.
[Jamal] "There are two in the front
and only one in the rear."
This way.
-All right, this is already wrong.
-Oh, sorry.
We've got to get you guys in sync,
because right now it's looking like...
-A mess.
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-All right, let's go again.
[Trixie] <i>They're not dancers,</i>
<i>but they better get it now,</i>
because we don't have time
to struggle with the choreography.
{\an8}[Jamal] Hey, hey, hey.
{\an8}-Team Ginger's in the house.
-Something like that.
[Ginger] <i>When I lead</i>
<i>our group in for our rehearsal,</i>
<i>and I see Jamal standing there,</i>
{\an8}I about flood my basement,
'cause that is one good-looking man.
The choreography goes like this.
♪ <i>If there be, one, two,</i>
<i>understanding, and none--</i> ♪
I can't do that.
It's just a rehearsal.
It's doing it over and over again.
Let's try it all together.
Let me see what that looks like.
From the top.
Ginger's like a bull in a china shop,
but when she's doing the choreo,
she becomes a mouse.
I keep getting caught up on that thing.
I'm thinking about it before I get there,
so I'm kind of screwed.
I could tell that.
You look scared in the front.
[laughs]
Let's do it again. Here we go.
Come on. Say, ah, ah, ah...
I'm gonna slide. I'ma have to put
some slippy slides on the bottom.
Yeah, we gonna have to do
something with them shoes.
I need you to not be in your head,
you know what I mean?
And I see it with you. You know,
you have to let all of your things go.
I need you to sell it right now.
I had a knee injury last year.
I'm not trying to make any excuses,
but I did have a knee injury last year,
so I'm kind of still scared.
[Ginger] I picked my big girl sister,
Jaidynn, to be on my team
because I feel like there's solidarity
in solid girls,
but all I want to do is, I don't know,
call in a bomb threat or something
and hopefully we can postpone the show.
[lounge music playing]
-Girl, another day.
-Someone's going home.
[Ginger] How about the other team?
What do you guys still got to work on?
Honestly, we've...
Everything was really smooth.
How's that going for you?
Because I know you're not a performer.
What do you mean?
Well, you say. You're a fashion girl.
-But I still have to evoke emotion.
-But you don't have to do that,
-and one, two, step all the time.
-True. I mean...
Be careful the things that you say.
You have to remember,
-all this talking you be doing.
-Right.
[Miss Fame] <i>Some of them</i>
<i>are selling me short.</i>
<i>I've been hired to work</i>
<i>and do drag at clubs,</i>
<i>but I want to push the boundaries</i>
<i>of where drag can go.</i>
{\an8}I want to be the supermodel in drag.
We have strengths in other departments.
That's why we're all here together.
[Jasmine] A drag queen performs,
unless you just playing dress up.
It's not about trying to be pretty.
It's about entertaining.
But some of us don't want to be
at the club for the rest of our career.
[Jaidynn] Oh!
-Bitch, you in the wrong competition.
-You right, girl. You right.
[Ginger] Whoo!
I just wanted to call it
like I see it with Miss Fame.
I didn't mean for everybody
to jump in at once and start a turf war.
It's not <i>West Side Story</i>.
[lounge music playing]
This is my first time in drag.
-It's actually kind of adorable.
-Shut up!
You look kind of the same.
Miss Fame, get your pictures real quick.
[Miss Fame] This is my husband, Patrick.
These are my mom. She didn't raise me.
She struggled with drugs and alcohol
throughout my entire life.
-[Violet] Your grandparents raised you?
-[Miss Fame] Yeah.
Sorry. This picture
is just getting me today.
I don't know why. It's so weird.
My grandfather was murdered
when I was 15, in high school.
Oh, my God.
I remember the phone call.
I couldn't comprehend that loss.
<i>It was so sudden.</i>
<i>That was the man that supported me</i>
<i>and raised me since I was six months old.</i>
It's like my... my soft spot is there.
{\an8}Miss Fame's been through a lot.
Overcoming all of that and being here
is an accomplishment in itself.
It must be really hard
to go through a lot like that.
-[Trixie] It's okay, girl.
-[Violet] We'll win this challenge.
We're fucking here to win it,
and you should be proud of yourself.

Welcome, ladies.
You performed in teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.
[tense music playing]
Trixie Mattel. Max.
Pearl. Jasmine Masters.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Kennedy Davenport. Kandy Ho.
Ladies, you are safe.
Please deplane to the backstage.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
-Loved your hair.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Thanks for flying.
Is this your bag?
Ladies, you represent
the top and bottom of the week,
and now it's time
for the judges' critique.
First up, Katya.
You're like Hawaiian Barbie
airline flight attendant, and I love it.
[Michelle] But...
you were given the biggest monologue
and didn't know the words.
I don't know what the fuck happened.
When you're on a live performance,
just keep rolling with it,
because maybe people aren't noticing--
No, we noticed that. We noticed that.
-Next up, Violet Chachki.
-I love your outfit.
-[Carson] Her outfit's a little <i>Grease</i>-y.
-Sandy would love that.
You were so great in the skit.
It wasn't over the top. It was funny.
I noticed that you take yourself
rather seriously,
but underneath there's a clown.
So I'm waiting for her to come out.
Next up, Miss Fame.
I don't think the look says
"Jet Set Eleganza."
And the jewelry is gonna be
a real bitch at the TSA.
Just a heads up.
You were stiff. Maybe you were
uncomfortable with the choreo,
but that shouldn't be the reason
why you stand out.
We get that you're gorgeous,
you're a model.
Now you have got to loosen up.
Relax. Take your hands off your hips.
Yeah, there you are.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
You led your team
to what I think was a victory,
but explain to me how this dress says
"Jet Set Eleganza," please.
I picture this as something
that Elizabeth Taylor could wear.
-On an airplane?
-Of course.
-On her private jet.
-You have a huge personality
and a great charisma,
and you've got it.
Can I do something I've always wanted?
Yeah.
[deep voice] Sandy!
Next up, Sasha Belle.
I kind of lost you in the safety video,
except for when I did see the hair.
<i>That caught my eye,</i>
<i>'cause you kept trying to fix it.</i>
I get it. You don't want
something to just be hanging.
I love the big hair,
but it's so heavy in the front.
We can't see anything
that's going on the top part of you.
And you know, the dress,
it's just kind of shlumpy.
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
You were so alive.
You came out with so much energy.
You stayed in my mind.
I actually thought
you could have done more.
I wanted to see you really sit
on their tray tables.
-That's another show.
-Right. Yeah, okay.
-Jet Set Eleganza, I'm not getting it.
-No?
But what I am getting
is wife of the town lawyer.
He's taking you out to dinner, so you go
to Caché, and you get a nice dress.
Clocked.
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us frequent flyers,
what do you think?
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Jet Set Eleganza was adorable,
but she completely flubbed the words
on the largest monologue.
But I think she had good attitude.
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
Everything about her
is super poised and polished.
She grabbed me with her beauty
and her little seatbelt bit.
We got to see
a little glimmer of personality,
but there's so much more
that she's got to let bust out.
[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
She needs to just let it all hang out,
so to speak.
She's so concerned with looking beautiful
that she completely gets lost.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-[Carson] <i>I didn't know it,</i>
but now I love minj, which I know
is one of the world's great ironies.
-Do you really love minj?
-I love the minj.
Put a little ginger on that,
I could eat it all day.
I love her personality, and she's a star.
But with that said,
Jet Set Eleganza... Meh.
-[RuPaul] <i>Sasha Belle.</i>
-[Olivia] <i>I feel sorry for her.</i>
She was going for the hair, and I thought,
"Stop, let it go. Take your hand away."
And then her Jet Set Eleganza.
Girl, nobody's sitting on a plane in that.
Everything seems
a little bit flat to me with her.
-Except her ass.
-Except her ass, yes.
[RuPaul] <i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>
She upped her camp factor.
I was so happy with her.
That scat performance
was pretty impressive.
-Then, Jet Set Eleganza.
-You really hate this one.
It was so regular.
Well, she borrowed the outfit from me.
-Uh-oh.
-[Carson] Wah-wah.
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Sasha Belle, your performance
was a real departure
but to a destination unknown.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}[Sasha] This is a nightmare come true.
{\an8}I didn't come here
to be in the bottom two on week two.
Mrs. Kasha Davis,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Violet Chachki,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Ginger Minj, you love to fly,
and it shows.
Condragulations, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
{\an8}You've won five-night
luxury hotel accommodations.
{\an8}-Courtesy of My Gay Getaway.
-Thank you.
{\an8}Winning means
absolutely everything to me,
{\an8}because it was something
that I was afraid to do,
and not only did I survive it,
I conquered it. It's a big day for me.
[RuPaul] Katya, your outfit is a Xana-do.
But your lip sync was a real Xana-don't.
Miss Fame,
you were on automatic pilot,
and you never landed it.
Katya,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-Miss Fame, you may join the others.
-Thank you.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life!
{\an8}I'm about to perform a song
by Olivia Newton-John in front of her,
and I am sweating
like a hooker in church.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

{\an8}Welcome to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}Tonight, the queendom has gathered
from far and near
{\an8}to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
{\an8}In fact, we have the largest turnout ever.
Sixty queens, past and present,
under one roof. Now that's... Yes.
[cheers and applause]
Yes.
That's a lot of duct tape.
A lot of duct tape.
Hey, PorkChop.
Michelle Visage,
I see you brought the girls.
-I never leave home without them.
-[RuPaul] I meant Ross and Carson.
[both] Hi!
Now, tonight, we're doing
things a little differently.
Ginger Minj, Pearl, and Violet Chachki,
I have not, repeat,
I have not made my final decision.
So, to help me make up my mind,
I've asked each of you to prepare
a lip-sync performance
to a song created especially for you.
Ladies, this will be your last chance
to impress me and to prove to the world
that you have what it takes
to become America's next drag superstar.
Yes.
So, gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
This season's race for the crown
is the tightest in herstory.
So I've challenged the top three queens
to perform one last time.
First up, get ready to pray and slay
with the right reverend Ginger Minj.

[RuPaul] Ginger Minj,
you just flooded my basement.
While you catch your breath,
let's talk to the judges. Michelle Visage,
-what did you think?
-Very Patti LaBelle. No, she better do.
-I'm very proud of you, Ginger Minj.
-Thank you.
You have always been an entertainer,
and that's how you got here.
-Congratulations, honey.
-Well, praise the Lord and hallelu-jer.
I still love the minj.
Well, thank you, judges.
Ginger, tonight, you took us to church,
but all season long, you've been taking us
on one wild ride. Let's take a look.
{\an8}Hi, fellas. I like to describe myself
as a glamour toad.
{\an8}She always wants to look neat,
petite, and ready to eat.
-I have low sugar.
-[laughter]
♪ <i>Eggs, eggs, eggs</i>
<i>All I want is eggs</i> ♪
[Michelle] <i>She can give you comedy,</i>
<i>glamour, singing, and acting.</i>
<i>I mean, she's a quadruple threat.</i>
This is America. Land of the free,
home of the fat people.
If we're supersizing our French fries,
why not supersize our next drag superstar?
[laughter]
-You and the bitter old lady brigade...
-Oh, girl.
were throwing shade at the younger girls.
-Do you regret that?
-Well, let me say, I'm a size 22,
no matter which way the light hits me,
I'm gonna throw shade somewhere.
But, in all serious... You know,
when I was growing up, I came
from a very Southern, very practical,
church-going family, so I was
never encouraged to speak my mind
or ask questions.
Drag gave me my voice.
So I'm finally not afraid
to ask questions and say what I feel.
I know, girl, that I do come off
a little bit abrasive sometimes,
but it all comes
from a place of love. That's it.
All right. Good.
So I'll tell you what. We're gonna take
some questions from your fans.
[Darienne] Hi.
{\an8}Celeste from Richmond wants to know:
"Is it time for a big girl to win?"
{\an8}Well, it is time for a big girl to win,
but I don't want to win because I'm big,
but because I came in with guns a-blazing,
and I killed the competition.
So, you've got a lot of people
rooting for you. Let's take a look.
Hi, Ginger, this is your sister.
I've always known you were a star.
I hope America sees
what the family has always seen in you.
Hi, I'm John Waters,
and I'm here for Ginger Minj.
Congratulations on getting to the finals
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I'm rooting for you, and so is
Edith Massey from beyond the grave.
Hi, Ginger, it's mom.
I'm so proud of you.
I love watching you perform. I love you
so much, and congratulations. Bye!
Hey, Ginger, this is dad.
You know I've always been proud of you,
and I'm proud that you're my son,
and I've always tried to be there for you,
and I know sometimes I've failed at that,
but, you know, I'm a work in progress.
For you to think
that I don't approve of you
makes me feel like I failed as a father.
There's no way
that I don't approve of you.
Hopefully, tonight,
we can start two new chapters.
One, you winning everything
and going on to your fame and fortune,
something that you've worked...
[exhales deeply]
...you've worked very hard for.
And hopefully, we can start
another chapter, you and I,
and we can move on and bond together
from here forward. Sorry.
Nobody knows how hard he's worked.
He's very special.
Good luck tonight. I'm so proud of you.
And we'll definitely be watching.
[cheers and applause]
What does it feel like
to hear your father say those words?
{\an8}Other than my mom,
I never felt loved growing up.
{\an8}And I hope that this does lead to...
not only reconciliation, but...
a relationship that I never had.
[cheers and applause]
And I hope he feels bad enough
to buy me new bottom lashes
'cause these were custom.
So what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?
Oh, God. Who doesn't want
to be part of that legacy?
I mean, you've created something
that's so special for all of us.
And to even be considered
to be part of that is overwhelming.
Ginger, you are my kind
of plus-size queen.
You've got a big talent, a big heart,
and a big future ahead of you.
-I love you, Ginger.
-I love you too.
We all love the minj.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

-Good morning, Pearl.
-Good morning.
It's time to hear from the judges.
Michelle, what do you have to say?
You came into this competition,
you had a bit of an attitude,
but as time went on,
you became lovable, you became awake,
and you earned
your spot here in the final.
-You had to come out of your shell...
-Oh, look at you.
-Don't you love...
-Like a pearl, pearl in a shell.
But I think the audience has spoken,
and the people like you. They really do.
Congratulations.
You've come a long way, baby.
Let's take a look.
{\an8}'Sup? I would describe Pearl
as a robotic Stepford wife bitch.
<i>I've been drawing Pearl since I was ten.</i>
<i>Then one day, I just painted her on me.</i>
You've been sleepwalking.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
You kind of, like,
told me I had no personality.
Well, I'm hoping
it will light a fire under your ass.
-Do I have something on my face?
-Ah!
I had a rough childhood, okay?
I wasn't watching <i>Batman and Robin.</i>
[Michelle] <i>Someone set</i>
<i>their alarm clock and woke up.</i>
[RuPaul] <i>Well,</i> flazéda<i>.</i>
-<i>You're a weirdo.</i>
-[Pearl] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
[RuPaul] <i>Boy, have you changed.</i>
Now, there's nothing
that could break my spirit.
Attagirl, Pearl.
[cheers and applause]
-So, Pearl, what made you wake up?
-You said something a long time ago.
It was like, "The fear of looking
stupid is really holding you back,"
and, yeah, I mean, I'm not a quitter.
And I wasn't about to quit on <i>Drag Race</i>.
Good, I'm glad you didn't.
Have you heard of this conspiracy theory
called the Curse of Pearl,
where any queen who crosses you
immediately goes home?
Yeah, it's been brought up.
You didn't go home though.
Uh, bitch...
The thing is, I actually...
I didn't cross you.
I almost just threw your ass
out of the door.
{\an8}Take a look at this.
Which queen has least impressed you?
I'd have to say Pearl.
[RuPaul] Sasha Belle, sashay away.
I noticed this black trim around her chin.
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"
[RuPaul] Jasmine, girl, sashay away.
There is this part of Pearl
that is too cool for season seven.
[RuPaul] Sashay away.
I can forgive her, but I'll never forget.
[RuPaul laughs]
-We have some questions from some fans.
-Oh.
Oh, look who's here. It's Alaska.
{\an8}Hi!
Hi!
'Sup?
Xavier from California wants to know:
"Pearl, is it just me,
or does everybody want to fuck you?"
I'm single. Single.
How do you deal
with the attention you've gotten?
I want people to like me
because I'm talented and I'm unique
and I have nerve,
and I have, you know, charisma,
or... not in that order. But thank you.
[RuPaul] Now,
you have a lot of people
in your corner. Let's take a look.
I have something on my face,
and it's a big smile of love,
pride, and joy
for my number-one grandson.
-Love you, Matty. From your grandma.
-Ah!
Hey, Pearl.
Chicago family sends you love.
-You've slayed all season.
-You've been killing it. We love you.
Come on, chin strap!
-We're so proud of you.
-So proud.
-We wish you all the luck in the world.
-We love you.
-Love you so much.
-Love you. More than anything.
I wanted to send you a quick message
letting you know how proud I am of you.
You have always been a special...
special little boy,
from the time you were two and three,
running around in your sister's tutu,
to the time that I knew
I was going to lose you to a big city.
I knew one thing would never change,
and that is my love for you.
I love you as my son.
I love you as Pearl.
And we could not be more proud of you.
And I am so happy
to have watched you go through this.
I love you, and we'll see you soon.
[cheers and applause]
Pearl, your mother is here.
I want to say hi to the mother of Pearl.
{\an8}-Hello, mother of Pearl.
-Hello, Ru.
{\an8}Now, you've gone over and above
for your support of Pearl. Tell us more.
One day, I thought,
"I should do a fan page."
Within just a few hours,
I was literally inundated
with private messaging
from younger gay boys, um...
Looking for sex.
-No, that's... that's <i>my</i> fan page.
-No, that's your fan page, right.
[Pearl's mother] I was messaged
by so many people.
"How do I come out to my parents?"
It's been pretty amazing.
That's fabulous. That's wonderful.
So, Pearl, what would you do
with $100,000?
Maybe buy some nice wigs after seeing
myself in thirsty-ass wigs all season.
Now, one final question:
do I have something on my face?
The answer is yes.
And it's a mixture of pride,
affection, and about
two and a half inches of foundation.
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Pearl.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
It's time for one last tango
with a queen who's always in vogue.

[RuPaul] Come through, mama!
Okay, Violet, let's talk to the judges,
starting with... I hate Michelle Visage.
You can hate me all you want.
I loves me some Violet Chachki.
What's so impressive about you
is you have beautiful clothes,
but you wear the clothes,
they don't wear you.
You really present yourself.
Thank you.
Every week,
I've been on the edge of my seat
waiting for you to electrify me
with your looks.
And tonight, though, you electrified me
with your performance, honey.
-[Ross] You earned it.
-Thank you.
Thank you, judges.
Now, Violet Chachki, since day one,
you wowed us with your runway,
but this competition
has not always been a cinch for you.
Let's take a look.
{\an8}I'm a one-of-a-kind collectible.
{\an8}Party.
{\an8}<i>My biggest strength is aesthetics.</i>
<i>I'm very visually appealing.</i>
Is that conceited?
[RuPaul] <i>You took fashion risks,</i>
<i>and they paid off.</i>
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you tartan eleganza.</i>
<i>I'm giving you 1956 Dior.</i>
<i>I'm giving you John Willie</i>
<i>vintage smut for your nerves.</i>
You might have been playing
a dead person, but we were living.
Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of bitchy.
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, boo-boo.
They think I'm mean, but all I've done
either comes from a place of humor
or a place of truth.
The biggest thing
that I've learned in this process
<i>is to just be aware</i>
<i>of your first impressions.</i>
<i>I represent the past, the present,</i>
<i>but more than anything, the future.</i>
So when did you start
designing your own clothes?
I think I started sewing
around, like, eighth grade.
Skinny jeans were just becoming a thing,
and they didn't have them
in boys' clothes.
And I also tailored
my Catholic school uniform.
-You went to Catholic school?
-K through 12.
I would do alterations mostly, so I think
at 12 or 13, I got a sewing machine.
Where'd all this confidence come from?
I got to a point in my life where I was
sick of dealing with other people's...
What they wanted me to do.
I said, "You know what? I'm gonna
live my life for me, and that's it."
We have some fan questions.
Are you ready?
-Yeah, let's do it.
-All right, there is Gia Gunn.
{\an8}[Violet] Hi, Gia Gunn.
From Skylar from California:
"Violet, what would you tell a teenager
who wants to do drag
but is afraid of how their family
and friends will react?"
What I did is, I would do drag
in the middle of the night in my bedroom.
Eventually, I went out, snuck around,
just do it in secret until it became okay
and I became comfortable to do it
and be proud of it.
-Oh, that's good advice.
-Absolutely. I think that's wonderful.
Thank you, Gia.
Do we have another question?
-Hi.
-Hi, Mimi.
{\an8}Okay, Violet Chachki,
{\an8}you were voted
the shadiest queen by the other girls.
Chris from San Diego wants to know:
"Who did you vote for and why?"
I think I voted for myself, actually.
I'm honest.
If you can't hate yourself, how the hell
are you going to hate somebody else?
There you have it. It's time to hear
from some of your biggest supporters.
-Let's take a look.
-I'm Team Violet because she is sickening.
Team Violet for the win!
Yes, bitch! Fuck it up!
Slay! Come through!
<i>Hi, Violet, mom here.</i>
I just wanted to say congratulations
for making it to the finals.
I am so proud
of the way you have handled yourself.
We wanted to let you know
how proud we are.
We never doubted
you'd make it to the finals.
Now the world knows it too.
We're proud to be your friends.
-Now make them bitches eat it.
-We love you.
Hi, Violet, your dad here. I would like
to wish you all the success in the world.
I am proud of the level of accomplishment
you've achieved doing what you love to do.
I hope to see you go all the way
to the top. Good luck. We love you.
{\an8}Your mother, Alex, is here.
{\an8}What advice do you have for parents
with children as flamboyant as Violet?
As a parent, you have to let them
be their own person.
-That's all you can do.
-[RuPaul] Right.
That's good advice. Thanks, Alex.
Now, Violet, what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?
It would mean everything.
This is it. This is what I love to do.
I have such a passion for it.
It gives me life. It's everything to me.
It brings me so much happiness and joy.
In whatever mood I'm in,
I can watch a bitch like Kennedy twirl
and just get so happy watching it.
It moves me. I love it so much.
And it would mean the world to me.
Well, Violet Chachki, you are not
just a one-of-a-kind collectible.
You are a treasure.
Ladies and gentlemen, Violet Chachki.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Now, while the top three
are backstage getting ready,
it's time to catch up with the queens
that made this season sickening.
Starting with a drag dad, a code cracker,
a corn popper, and a very married lady.
{\an8}Mama's home. Ah!
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}My drag style is influenced
by campy and kitschy people of the world.
[Kandy] So how old are you?
-Oh! How old am I? Really?
-How old?
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle.
Say hello to my little friends!
{\an8}<i>I can tell you every episode,</i>
<i>what the challenge was, who went home.</i>
I've cracked the code.
<i>We'll never pick up</i>
<i>hot men looking like this.</i>
<i>I'm the next drag superstar</i>
<i>because I've done my homework.</i>
{\an8}-We made it, bitches!
-Yes!
{\an8}<i>Jasmine is class and elegance.</i>
{\an8}I am here. H-E-R-E, bitch. I'm here.
Where did you get a loaf of bread?
[Jasmine] <i>No tea, no shade,</i>
<i>no pink lemonade.</i>
Ding!
{\an8}Hi, my honeys. I'm home.
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-[RuPaul] Is that Joan Rivers?
-What are you wearing?
[Kasha] <i>Anybody can be a girl,</i>
<i>but it takes balls to be a lady.</i>
There's always time for a cocktail.
Tempest DuJour, Kandy Ho accused you
of being too old. How did you feel?
Well, it never feels good,
but Kandy and I are friends.
I wish that, you know, at my age,
she looks half as fabulous as I do.
I'm sorry for calling you old.
-Apology accepted.
-My mom taught me better.
To be nice to old people.
-I love you, girl. I love you so much.
-I love you, too, I really do.
You also have an eight-year-old
and a five-year-old at home.
-Correct.
-Did they watch?
They did.
My daughter watched the first episode.
She cried when I got eliminated.
She said, "Papa, why doesn't
RuPaul like you anymore?"
Mimi, if you're watching,
RuPaul loves your daddy. Now, go to bed!
Next up, we've got Sasha Belle.
You arrived thinking that you had cracked
the code. What happened?
I thought that I did crack the code.
I thought I knew what you wanted,
but I think what makes the show so great
is that it's so different every season.
-And I wasn't ready.
-All right.
Now, back in Iowa, you host a night
called "Sasha Belle's Drag Race,"
-is that right?
-Yes, yes.
First of all, you'll be hearing
from my lawyers.
And, second of all, how is that going?
It's going really good. We do it
because I really fucking love this show.
I do.
If there was no grand prize,
I would still play.
You keep ringing them bells.
All right. Thank you.
-Up next, Jasmine Masters.
-Oh, my God.
What was your most exciting moment
on the drag race?
-Meeting Kennedy.
-Really?
Yeah. Because I have watched her
at least nine years, ten years
on VCR tapes doing pageants
and dancing and stuff.
And... I'm sorry if I snitch
on your age, girl. Forgive me, girl.
-Jasmine, who inspired you to do drag?
-Patti LaBelle.
She who she is when she on stage,
when she off stage. She gives 1,000%.
-I just love her. She's everything to me.
-Well, we have a surprise for you.
-Take a look.
-What?
Hi, Jasmine.
I love the way you stirred it up, honey.
Thank you for always looking
like Patti LaBelle at my concerts.
I love you. Bye.
Are you serious, Ru?
You did that for me?
[RuPaul] Yeah.
Yes. Yep.
Well, I felt like we needed
to lift you up even more,
because on social media,
people were very harsh to you.
-How did that make you feel?
-When you...
...are getting so much negativity,
it's like you can't breathe.
And it took me back to a friend of mine
who had committed suicide
when they were bullied so much
being young and gay.
Their parents put them out.
The straight and the gay world
didn't accept them,
so they just ended it 'cause they didn't
feel like they belong. That's how I felt.
-Well...
-So it was hard,
but I just ate a lot of food
and a lot of hot sauce, and...
[RuPaul] I'm glad you did get through it,
and I'm glad you're here.
For seven years, our show has been one
of the most popular ones on social media.
But recently, there's been a shift
with more and more comments
having a darker tone.
But like my mama always said,
"Unless them bitches is paying your bills,
you pay them bitches no mind."
All right, next up, there's always time
for a cocktail and Mrs. Kasha Davis.
During the competition, you had
some issues with some of the younger kids.
What were they?
Some of the young gals on the show
just had sort of a sense of entitlement.
It gets a little grating in that respect,
where somebody, you know,
"I've been doing this
for seven months. I will win."
And they might. So, um...
But I learned a lot from these girls.
Trixie taught me how to put
way too much makeup on.
And I'm wearing
two of Violet's corsets right here.
I've always wanted to ask you,
is there really a Mr. Kasha Davis?
-There is.
-[RuPaul] Where is he?
{\an8}-Right here in the...
-[RuPaul] That's him?
{\an8}-[Kasha] That's Mr. Davis.
-[RuPaul] Hi, Mr. Kasha Davis.
-He's cute.
-He's cute.
Get ready, Mr. Davis,
'cause mama's coming home.

Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
As our top three prepare backstage
for the crowning of our next superstar,
these four queens are the perfect balance
of sugar, spice, and everything nice.
Oh, and, um, chickens too. Take a look.
{\an8}I hope you girls got a sweet tooth,
because Kandy's in the fucking house.
{\an8}<i>Kandy is hot. Kandy is </i>candente<i>.</i>
<i>If you touch her too close,</i>
you might get burned.
I think this runway is right on my alley.
{\an8}Well, it's about time.
{\an8}<i>I do drag because I have the yearning</i>
<i>for old Hollywood glamour.</i>
{\an8}<i>I'm a starlet on the rise.</i>
There's a man on the wing!
-Tramp!
-You're the Meryl Streep of drag.
[Max] <i>It's all so surreal.</i>
{\an8}My name is Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
How y'all doing?
{\an8}<i>Because I am what? Fierce.</i>
Work that puss.
I have not officially come out
to my family yet.
I think it may change my relationship,
and that's what I'm scared of most.
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>My brand is runway shows,</i>
<i>magazines, beyond-this-planet beautiful. </i>
Should I not talk about my feelings,
or should I just keep moving on?
My God. I feel like I'm dating you.
How's your head?
How is your head?
How's your head?
Fine.
[clucking]
That's how I talk to chickens.
Kandy Ho, I hear that you are thinking
about leaving Puerto Rico?
-I am.
-<i>Escándalo</i>!
<i>Ay, sí.</i>
I love Puerto Rico,
and I've been there since I was ten,
-but...
-Where were you before?
Connecticut.
[Max] You're a liar!
-I guess I'm a fake Puerto Rican, right?
-Okay, all right.
-What would you have done differently?
-I wouldn't have painted on a beard.
I looked like a Neapolitan ice cream.
-Do you do your own makeup?
-I started doing it
a month before auditioning for the show.
In Puerto Rico, we just go up
to our fabulous makeup artists, like,
"Paint me and do my hair
and dress me up, and I'm gone."
-Yeah.
-It's, like, my mistake. Sorry.
Yeah. Kandy, my dear,
you are one of my favorite hos, and...
That's saying a lot,
because I know a lot of hos.
Next, the silver fox of season seven, Max.
Yes. Now, this season,
when the queens were talking about sex,
you weren't having it at all.
You were like...
Listen, these girls, they don't talk
about anything else besides sex.
But I was tired of it. Just for a moment.
-Okay.
-I'm not...
I'm not that big of a prude,
honest to goodness.
You coached Jaidynn and Pearl
through a few tense moments.
Tell us about that.
Well, Jaidynn is an actress.
She is a performer.
For her to say, "I'm not," that was
nerves, so we had to calm down.
Pearl had to calm down, we had to regroup,
and then we had to go kill it.
-Yeah.
-I love it. That's great.
That's great advice.
Well, Max, when it comes to my feelings
for you, there are no gray areas.
Thank you.
Up next, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
What surprised you the most
about being on the show?
Um, well, I didn't think
we were gonna be locked up so much.
-Child.
-You're sequestered.
And that was... I was imagining myself
going out to dinner with you, darling.
-Yeah.
-I thought we'd go to Hollywood Boulevard.
Get some munchies,
some cauliflower, corn bread,
green beans, a turkey.
And I wasn't able to do that.
I was sitting in my hotel room,
-beating myself up and eating Doritos.
-That's different from your normal life?
You revealed that your mother
and your brother knew that you did drag.
-Yes.
-But they didn't know that you're gay.
-Right.
-And now?
-Where is that right now?
-Well, I think it was...
she didn't want me to be that way.
I don't think they understand,
-you know, fully, who a gay person is.
-Well, that's funny,
because we have a little surprise for you.
Take a look at this.
Surprise, surprise!
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.
You had some concerns.
I've experienced rejection in my life,
so it's very hard for me to reject mine,
because I know how hurtful
and painful rejection is.
<i>You know, this is not a battle,</i>
<i>it's just...</i>
one thing that we're just gonna learn
to just go ahead and do what we do,
and that's love one another.
My love is not based on what you do.
My love is based on who you are.
And you're my precious,
handsome Christopher.
What are you feeling right now?
I feel like my family is now gonna be able
to get to know who I really am,
after 26 years of my life.
If I don't get anything else, I got
the peace and the freedom to be who I am
around my family, and to be happy.
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>, still bringing
families together. Hallelu.
All right.
Up next, Miss Fame, girl, hey.
Hi.
-By the way, how's your head?
-Well, there have been a few complaints.
[Miss Fame] What?
You and Katya came clean
-about being sober.
-Right.
-And what's the reaction been?
-You know what,
I've had so many people write me
personal stories about how much time
they had, how inspiring it was.
It's just a dream come true
to be able to walk through
the obstacle of addiction
and be able to...
live your life.
Miss Fame, all season long, you served
fierce couture, gorgeous fashions,
and people only want
to talk to you about chickens.
I'm not mad about it.
At least they're talking to me.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
I grew up on a farm
with the chickens, so...
Can you talk a little chicken?
-Can you do that?
-I can, but I think it's best I have...
a special guest come out
to help me do that.
-Is Colonel Sanders here?
-Hold on one moment.
Colonel Sanders? I thought he was dead.
-Oh, my God, you fucking bitch!
-Gorgeous!
She's got bigger hair than me tonight.
-Do you do tricks with it?
-I'm afraid of it shitting on my couture.
Oh, dear.
Miss Fame, whether in fashion or poultry,
you have a bright future ahead of you.
-Just don't cluck it up, okay?
-I promise I won't!
[RuPaul] Okay.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
We are moments away from finding out
if Ginger, Pearl or Violet Chachki
will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
But first, some fierce contenders
that gave our top three a real run
for their money. Let's take a look.
{\an8}This isn't Maury Povich.
{\an8}<i>Drag queens say,</i>
<i>"Paint for the back row."</i>
I paint for the check-cashing place
down the street.
If you're gonna be the comedy queen,
you gotta go all the way.
You right, girl, you right.
<i>I'm back. Good evening,</i>
<i>distinguished panel of judges.</i>
Sashay away.
All right, public school. Calm down.
{\an8}[speaking Russian]
{\an8}<i>I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill,</i>
<i>Russian bisexual transvestite hooker.</i>
♪ <i>Feel the heat on my sizzling meat</i> ♪
I'm not going anywhere.
Ru and I are great friends.
-Miss Fame did our makeup.
-[Michelle] Ah!
{\an8}When do I get to blow them?
{\an8}-I can't say that either?
-[laughter]
{\an8}Well, hello.
{\an8}<i>I'm Kennedy Davenport. I spin, I flip,</i>
<i>I jump off the stage in six-inch heels.</i>
-Kennedy, did you rehearse your team?
-That was a rough spot.
Next. Whoo!
-[Ross] Kennedy...
-[Ross and Kathy singing] Davenport!
Shut up!
[RuPaul] <i>Newark, LaGuardia,</i>
<i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
Ain't nobody got time for that.
-So, Trixie Mattel.
-Hi, Ru.
When you first left, the internet
went cray cray. What was that like?
I felt very supported and loved.
I felt like less of a loser.
-Well, losing is the new winning.
-Yes!
What's your life been like
since <i>Drag Race</i>?
Oh, my gosh.
If I never get a chance again,
I have to thank you, because...
you reached into my little blond,
pink life and changed it so much.
[cheers and applause]
I'm glad you got to experience this.
Now, I hear you do
a mean RuPaul impersonation.
I could never.
-Let me hear it.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-Trixie, on the runway you're a doll,
but your comedy seems manufactured.
-Are you mad?
-Sashay away.
Three times! Three times!
Next up, Katya!
Katya, all season long, you were
plagued with doubt. What was going on?
-I was terrified the whole fucking time.
-Really?
RuPaul, you are sitting there, I see you,
-but I want to tackle you to the ground.
-Uh-huh. Yeah?
I want to stuff your entire wig
inside my mouth...
[RuPaul] Okay, yeah.
-And I want you to pee on me.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-And listen.
The first time you came over
to me, I was, like,
waiting my whole life for this.
-Sure.
-And... I don't know.
There's something in my brain
that said, "She wants to kill you."
And I... I know you don't want to...
I mean, I'm 98% sure at least.
Oh, no, I did want to kill you.
And then I just couldn't...
I don't know.
But now, having seen the show,
do you see that it's unfounded,
that you have no reason to doubt yourself?
Do you you were fabulous?
Watching the show has given me...
some self-esteem.
So thank you so much, Ru.
Katya, you are a freak. And...
-I freaking love you.
-Oh, my God.
[cheers and laughter]
All right, up next,
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.
Now, Kennedy, when I started
saying that, I had no idea
that you would actually
fly off the main stage.
-Have you ever hurt between me down there?
-No, I mean, I'm a trained dancer.
-You mean "dahn-cer."
-"Dahn-sah."
[RuPaul] Yes.
So I did the necessary things to stretch,
to make sure that did not happen.
But there's more down there
that could get hurt.
Yeah, way more than Katya.
-It's true.
-Yeah.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
Throughout the season,
we joked about "the struggle is real."
It became one of your tag lines,
but in your family, in your background,
that's a reality.
I know that you recently reunited
with your mother after a long separation.
My mother's been in and out.
My dad got custody when I was two,
and my sister was two months.
And she would make me mad
because she said she'd come,
and she never did, and she was in and out.
-She was on her own journey.
-But she's here tonight with you,
-right?
-Yeah.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Chicory, are you there?
Is that Chicky right there? I love it.
{\an8}-Hey, Mama Chicory.
-Hi.
I am so glad you are here with us tonight.
Give her a big round of applause.
And on another note,
if you ever have the chance to get out
and see Miss Kennedy Davenport in concert,
live, it will give you life. Trust. Yes.
-Yes, it's true.
-Thank you.
{\an8}Now it's time
for viewer questions. Who's first?
{\an8}-Hi! I have a question for Trixie...
-[RuPaul] Uh-huh.
{\an8}-From Sarah.
-Yeah.
"You and Max knew each other in college.
Did Max speak
with that fake-ass British accent then?"
[crowd hooting and cheering]
I don't think so, but I've never been
to that area of Wisconsin.
-Maybe they talk that way.
-Yeah, that's true.
It's just an elocution thing, a diction
and an elocution thing, not an accent.
-What'd she say?
-She says it's elocution, not an accent.
-"Alacutia"?
-Uh-huh.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
-Is she from Inglewood?
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-I know her. I know her.
-I went to high school with her.
Yeah.
{\an8}-Well, Delta Work, you better work.
-I have a question from Amy in Boston.
"If there's an <i>All-Stars Two</i>, which queen
from season seven deserves to compete?"
Kennedy, who would you condone?
Nominate. Who would you nominate?
To be honest and to answer the question,
I really would choose Katya.
So you guys know something
about <i>All-Stars Two</i> that I don't.
Well, thank you, ladies.
Now it's time to announce the winner
of this year's Miss Congeniality.

{\an8}Greetings, earth queens.
I come in peace.
{\an8}I'm Miss Fame, I'm 29 years old,
and I'm beyond-this-planet beautiful.
Well, it looks like I'm the only one here.
Thank God.
My brand is classic,
chic fashion model.
I think I might choose a center spot.
Center stage, it feels appropriate.
I'm ready to show everybody
what I'm meant to do,
<i>which is leave a beauty mark</i>
<i>on the face of the planet.</i>
Hi, fellas.
{\an8}My name is Ginger Minj,
and I am a overweight, asthmatic,
{\an8}chain-smoking cross-dresser
from Orlando, Florida.
I like to describe myself
as a glamour toad.
-You look gorgeous.
-Something subtle for groceries?
Just a little something
to pick up some apples.
I know that I will never be
the prettiest one,
but I will always be the beautiful one.
How are y'all doing?
<i>My name is Jaidynn Diore Fierce,</i>
{\an8}capital F-I-E-R-C-E,
because I am what? Fierce.
Hi, gorgeous.
-How you doing? Come on, Miss Sickening.
-Okay, girl.
And is there another big girl?
I can only be the only big girl.
She's gonna serve you body. She's gonna
serve you everything you need to survive.
I'm always gonna give you life.
[laughs]
[Jaidynn] Uh-oh... Who is it?
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.
{\an8}I'm Violet Chachki, I'm 22 years old,
and I am a one-of-a-kind collectible.
-Hey, gang.
-Come on, shoes.
How are you doing?
[Violet] <i>My biggest strength</i>
<i>is probably aesthetics.</i>
I'm very visually appealing.
Is that conceited?
-Miss Fame.
-Violet Chachki.
Violet Chachki,
you can't forget that. [laughs]
I've seen Miss Fame's work before, and I'm
pretty impressed, but not that impressed.
[Violet] Tall fish.
{\an8}Well, it's about time.
{\an8}My name is Max,
and I'm a starlet on the rise.
-And you're Max?
-Yes, I'm Max.
-Period? Just Max?
-Max, period or capitalized,
or any way you want
to say it or spell it.
Cool.
I do drag because I have the yearning
for old Hollywood glamour.
-Where are you from, Max?
-I'm from Wisconsin, actually.
[Violet] Wisconsin.
Well, yes, this is a contest for queens,
but not the Queen of England, girl.
-Can I look at your paper?
-Of course.
[Miss Fame]
Let me teach you a beauty trick.
[Miss Fame] Blot away that shine.
I don't know if that came across shady,
but thank you, Max.
C'mon season seven!
-[Miss Fame] Is this Russia?
-[Katya] With love.
{\an8}My name is Ekatarina Petrovna Zamochkova,
but you can call me Katya.
[Jaidynn] Come on, accent.
{\an8}I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill,
Russian, bisexual transvestite hooker.
Is this the Shulman Bar Mitzvah?
[speaking Russian]
Katya is at the intersection
of glamour and comedy.
You can find her right on the corner,
selling her ass.
-Is this Soviet Union inspired?
-It's my great-grandma's army uniform.
[laughter]
-I'm here! We made it, bitches!
-[all] Yes!
{\an8}I'm Jasmine Masters,
and I'm 37 years old. Ding!
-How did you get this body?
-Girl, I don't know.
Jasmine is class and elegance.
Jasmine is... [snapping fingers]
...it.
-Where are you from?
-Nashville.
-Nashville, I'll be there. And you?
-Atlanta.
All right, Atlanta. Hotlanta, girl.
No one says that, but yes.
Okay, work.
Hi, my honeys, I'm home! [laughs]
Are there any other queens here?
Oh, just me, I guess. [laughs]
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis. [laughs]
I'm an international celebrity housewife,
because of that one time
I performed in Canada.
-Nice to meet you.
-I like your tits.
-Mine are still bigger, though.
-[all] Whoa, whoa!
-Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
-I'm jealous.
I don't have any fat to push together.
This isn't Maury Povich.
{\an8}My name is Trixie Mattel,
and I'm 24 years old.
Oh, my goodness!
Well, here's another comedy queen.
She has her overdrawn lips
and clown makeup. She is ready to go.
I'm a hair and makeup artist.
So...
I think a lot of the queens don't
necessarily get where I'm coming from.
Drag queens always say,
"Paint for the back row."
I paint for the check-cashing place
down the street.
I hope you girls have a sweet tooth,
because Kandy is
in the motherfucking house.
[Jaidynn] She's got a tag line.
{\an8}I'm Kandy Ho, and I'm 28 years old.
-From Puerto Rico.
-[all] Puerto Rico!
Kandy is hot.
Kandy is <i>candente</i>.
If you touch her too close,
you might get burned.
[cheering]
-[Jaidynn] Look who walked in, bitch.
-'Sup?
{\an8}I'm Pearl. I'm 23 years old.
I would describe Pearl as some kind
of robotic, Stepford Wife bitch.
-[Pearl] Hey, girls.
-[all] Hi, welcome.
I notice this black trim around her chin,
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"
But hey, you like it,
rock your own boat.
Come on, chin strap.
-Well, hello.
-[cheering]
{\an8}I'm Kennedy Davenport,
and I am the dancing diva of Texas, honey.
-Wait, Kennedy!
-Yes.
-Oh, my God!
-That's me.
I spin, I kick, I flip,
I jump off the stage in 6-inch heels.
That's what puts the diva in it.
Get over here.
I wanted to meet you forever, girl!
I'm a big fan of Kennedy Davenport.
I've been wanting to meet her for so long.
Like, Ru turned the party for me.
Oh, my God! [laughs]
For real, y'all,
I'm geeked the fuck up.
I'm geeked! I'm geeked!
Hey, it's me.
Say hello to my little friend!
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle,
I'm 28 years old,
{\an8}and I have been mentally preparing myself
for this for years.
[Miss Fame] Just anywhere will do.
I could tell you every episode,
what the challenge was, who went home.
I feel like I've cracked the code.
Hey, girls, what's going on?
I'm the next Drag Superstar
because I've done my homework.
Girl, please. No, sorry.
Next.
Who's ready for some hot tuna casserole?
'Cause mama's home.
Ugh!
[laughter]
[Jasmine] No, ma'am.
{\an8}I'm Tempest DuJour,
and I'm 46 years old.
[Miss Fame] A baby!
My drag style
is influenced by Phyllis Diller
and the campy
and kitschy people of the world.
-Your baby is adorable.
-Thank you. It's Amber, Amber Alert.
[Max] Amber Alert.
Tempest, she's an old-fashioned drag.
She tries to be funny, I guess.
-So how old are you?
-[Jaidynn] Oh!
[Tempest] How old am I?
Really?
Who the hell does that?
Who in their first meeting says
"How old are you"?
[Tempest] You don't stop dreaming
at a certain age.
[alarm sounding]

and model two
of your very best looks,
one from your spring collection
and one from your fall collection.
This is right up my alley, and I can't
wait for everyone to gag on my eleganza.
Your runway will be part
of this week's final evaluation.
Kill it on the catwalk
or end up fashion roadkill.
Your choice.
Dang, this is a lot for the first day.
They got us doing runways.
Hashtag too much.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}[sighs] Why do fashion shows
always start so late?
{\an8}For today's mini challenge,
we have to showcase
{\an8}our spring and fall looks on the runway,
sponsored by DKoye, the product for hair.
This is not a mini challenge.
This is a maxi mini challenge...
with wings.
Oh, wait a minute, it's starting.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Serving spring glamour,
Ginger Minj.
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>I'm doing runway for Michelle</i>
<i>Visage, RuPaul and Carson Kressley.</i>
I think I can see her tool.
[laughter]
[Ginger] <i>I know I can excel</i>
<i>at anything I put my mind to.</i>
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Milan, Paris, New York...
{\an8}Pacoima.
{\an8}[Kandy] <i>I'll give you face, I'll give</i>
<i>you ass, I'll give you legs.</i>
This Latina,
she's coming for all of you.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Max.</i>
{\an8}[Carson] Yes, darling. Sell the garment.
I'm making sure that I'm delivering,
and I get to fully portray the character.
[Alaska] I've had pelvic exams
more thrilling than this.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
[Carson] It's very Apollonia.
Apollonia six and seven.
-[RuPaul and Carson] And eight and nine.
-[Michelle] All the girls.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Oh...
-[Carson] I do love a onesie for spring.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-Excellent use of the cape.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
How dull.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
[RuPaul] I love you,
but give me Park Avenue.
[Michelle laughs] Yes.
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis is a lady.</i>
Anybody can be a girl,
but it takes a lot of balls to be a lady.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mitzi Gaynor.
Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}[Michelle] We finally know
what happened to Baby Jane.
My family's Native American.
We grew up very, very poor.
<i>But Trixie, she has it all.</i>
The biggest problem in her life is
what to wear the next day.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
-[RuPaul] Fur for spring.
-[Carson] Yes.
[RuPaul] Blame it on climate change.
Bitch, I'm from New York,
and you can wear fur in spring, okay?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
{\an8}[Michelle] Who is under that skirt?
[RuPaul] My first guess
would be Jimmy Hoffa.
[Michelle]
Oh, Geraldo should have gone there.
♪ <i>Sexy, sexy drag queen</i> ♪
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame!
[Carson] I would read her,
but she's red all over.
My strongest suit is modeling. Ideally,
that will carry me to get that crown.
-I see a red bottom, and it's not a shoe.
-Oh!
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>just a gag-worthy moment. </i>
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters.
[RuPaul] No jacket required.
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine Master is</i>
<i>bright as summer. I am here.</i>
H-E-R-E, bitch, I'm here.
{\an8}[Carson] Simple midriff.
It's tasteful.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
[Michelle] Oh, dear, she has a toothache.
-[Carson] I can see her spleen.
-[RuPaul] Spleens are very in this year.
-[Carson] Spleens are the new orange.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Niecy Nash.
I'm old school and
a touch of new school.
[Kennedy] Everything is bigger in Texas,
and I fit right on in.
[Michelle] She needs a casserole.
[RuPaul] But not tuna.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
{\an8}<i>I see those judges,</i>
<i>give 'em a little look.</i>
{\an8}I need to show them
how much I want this.
[Carson] She already has a fan.
[Alaska] Who uses fans anymore?
Now it's time to do our fall look.
Child, the struggle is real.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Let's see what they're
serving for fall. Ginger Minj.
{\an8}Ginger Minj is a plus-size diva.
{\an8}She always wants to look
neat, petite, and ready to eat.
-[RuPaul] She's like a magazine editor.
-[Carson] Yeah, popular wildlife.
{\an8}It's so hideous,
I think I'll put it on the cover.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Fur again.
[Carson] More fur.
It's shaved beaver, I believe.
[Michelle laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Max.
{\an8}[Carson]
I'm having Jil Sander flashbacks.
-Yes, right?
-And I like it.
-[RuPaul] Very Tilda Swinton.
-[Carson] Very.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
I see Chaka Khan.
[Carson] She's every woman.
This is definitely a signature
Jaidynn Diore Fierce look.
[Jaidynn] I'm the other,
other, other Tyra.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Fur's back.
[RuPaul] Yes, fur is back.
[Katya] I'm giving you dead animal
camouflage, Duck Dynasty realness.
Pamela Anderson, I'm so sorry.
[RuPaul] Oh, my God, she killed it.
I mean, she really killed it.
[Michelle] Literally.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-[RuPaul] Look at those curves.
-[Michelle] These are not for sale.
[Carson] I'm thinking Colombian
mother of the bride.
[Michelle chuckles]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}-[Carson] The handbag matches.
-[Michelle] Is that a sequins dress?
-[RuPaul] That is a sequins dress.
-[Michelle] Yes.
[Michelle] It's like two pigs
fighting under a blanket back there.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
You can't lose with black, you know?
[Michelle] She's a lady DJ.
[Michelle] Eat your heart out,
Paris Hilton.
I'm sure she's listening
to <i>Born Naked</i>, my new album.
-Of course.
-Can you hear us right now?
[Carson] Hello? Nothing.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
[Tempest] <i>The look I've chosen</i>
<i>is intended to show</i>
that I can have more than one kind
of campy, kitschy look.
-[Carson] I like the quilted poncho.
-[Michelle] It's a car cover.
[RuPaul laughs]
Please make it stop.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame. Wow.
-[RuPaul] Golden lady.
-[Carson] It's not lame, it's <i>lamé</i>.
[Michelle chuckles]
[Carson] I do like the fascinator.
-I'm fascinated by fascinators.
-Me too, I could talk about them for days.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters. Wow.
[RuPaul] Purple Rain.
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine is</i>
<i>in a purple trench coat with black fur.</i>
Well, not really fur.
Just some old carpet I straightened out.
[Jasmine laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
[Carlson] Looking smart in tartan.
[Michelle] Getting a reveal.
[all] Oh!
[RuPaul] Bay City Roller.
I'm giving you tartan eleganza. Being able
to serve two looks in one is a talent.
It's okay.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Yes, she's going back to her roots.
-[Michelle] All that green.
-[RuPaul] She's a sexy choir master.
[Carson] Yes.
[Michelle] Exactly what I was thinking.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
Oh, my word!
{\an8}-[Carson] Fan's back. Wow.
-[Michelle laughs]
-[Carson] What's going on in front?
-[Michelle] The underbelly of a lobster.
♪ <i>Cover girl, put the bass in your walk</i>
<i>Head to toe, let your whole body talk</i> ♪
-[RuPaul] I want one in every color.
-[Carson] Now we know what to wear.
-[Michelle, RuPaul] Yeah.
-I'll be wearing lobster.
Yeah. I go for my first
shell fitting next week.
[Carson] Oh, God!
Hi, everybody.
It's so nice to finally meet all of you.
Everybody's taking off their drag, and I'm
like, "Who the fuck are these people?"
Trixie... Did somebody from the crew
just wander into the workroom?
Pearl? Trade.
Ginger's transformation is remarkable.
She goes from Kathy Bates to Bob Hoskins.
-Hello, hello, hello, ladies!
-[all] Hi!
Well, well, well. This is the most
draggedy season premiere ever!
And we're just getting started. Pit crew!
[cheering, applause]
-[applause]
-Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!
I think the new pit crew member
may be Jewish.
[cheering]
<i>Mazel tov</i>.
All right, ladies,
the pit crew arrived in the buff
because for the first time
in Drag Race her-story,
you'll be making your
main stage debut...
naked...
-...and afraid.
-[hooting]
[screams]
You need to create a resort-wear look
that tears away to reveal
{\an8}a nude illusion.
Because you were what?
{\an8}Hashtag, born naked and the rest is drag.
No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade,
but looking at some of these queens,
I'm thinking, "Ru, you don't want to see
these girls naked. I know you don't."
{\an8}The Maxi Challenge this week is
to create resort wear that has a tear-away
{\an8}to reveal a nude illusion.
I pride myself on utilizing literally
none of my natural features,
so a challenge where I compete
with these beautiful fishy girls
with perfect bodies
is a worst-case situation.
{\an8}I'm just hoping
this looks expensive.
{\an8}My brand that is Miss Fame is
runway shows, fashion magazines, glamour.
So I love this challenge.
I really want to win badly.
That looks resort-y.
Does anybody have scissors?
Be a good Christian and let me use them.
-Hey, cutie girl.
-[all] Hi.
-How are my nudie-patootie?
-[Jasmine] Nude.
-Well, Tempest DuJour.
-RuPaul.
I'm excited to see what you come up with.
I know you're a costume designer.
I am. I teach it,
so I feel a little pressure
from my students who'll be watching this.
When you auditioned a few years ago,
you were still heavy.
-Yeah. I was just under 400 pounds.
-Ex-squeeze me?
<i>I'm trying to lead by example.</i>
<i>That was the catalyst for the weight loss.</i>
Part of it was,
I gotta be alive for these kids.
{\an8}I've been with my husband now
for eight years,
{\an8}<i>and I have two amazing</i>
<i>and beautiful adopted children.</i>
I'm at a place in my life now where
my children are more important to me
than that bucket of fried chicken.
I'll let you get back to work.
I want to see what you come up with.
-Thanks, Ru. Bye.
-Thanks.
-Kandy Ho.
-Hey, mamas.
From the Ho family of products.
Tell me about your nude illusion.
Traditionally on our show,
Puerto Ricans like to show a lot of body.
I love to show body.
I think this runway is right on my alley.
-It's on your alley? [laughs]
-Yes.
-Okay. Do you know how to sew?
-I don't.
How do you become a drag queen
without knowing how to sew?
I think it takes more than sewing,
because you can know how to sew,
but you can have
the worst taste ever.
Any sensible queen should know
how to make a dress.
You know, it's part of the game
you have to play.
Oh, bitch!
-Why, Jasmine Masters!
-Yes, mother Ru?
What are you planning
for the reveal on the main stage?
It's like a butterfly in a cocoon.
-I've heard of those, yes.
-I'm going to be
some type of a cocoon that grows.
So, as I'm walking down the runway,
I'm gonna grow.
The butterfly is actually in the cocoon.
This is the cocoon.
-Right...
-Which is me, the butterfly.
-You know, like a butterfly in a cocoon?
-Uh-huh.
Every step that I take down the runway,
the butterfly inside is growing.
Oh, yeah.
So once I get to the end of the runway,
the butterfly is there.
Okay, great. Great.
Well, keep working. All right.
{\an8}Jasmine's resort tear-away
is two hula hoops with fabric around it.
Who the hell is going
to a resort wearing that?
All right, ladies. Get ready to
put on a show, and then take it all off.
Good luck!
And remember, don't fuck it up.
-[Trixie] Your partner, are you married?
-Yeah. We got married last year.
[Trixie] My boyfriend's family,
last Christmas, they really liked me.
Then they found out about drag
and called him in a panic.
-"Don't be with somebody like that."
-[Miss Fame] For real?
{\an8}They don't like drag.
I don't understand how they don't get
{\an8}that it's just me playing a person.
His mom said, "Trixie's clown drag
makes me sick to my stomach."
[Miss Fame] Oh, my God.
They were right about one thing.
[laughter]
-This is really happening.
-[Violet] I know. Someone's going home.
{\an8}I am terrified for this elimination.
We have to be naked,
and I have the body
of a 55-year-old Irish rock climber.
Give me a fucking break!

[RuPaul] Remember that time
Jo Anne Worley posed for Playboy?
[Michelle, Carson] No.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
{\an8}[Michelle] Diane von Fistenberg.
[Sasha] <i>I'm feeling amazing.</i>
[Sasha] <i>I'm giving you J-Lo just waking up</i>

[RuPaul] Well, it looks like everybody's

{\an8}-[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.

[Michelle] Let me just take this off.
It's a little warm in here, isn't it? Oh.
[Tempest] <i>I don't have fish to serve,</i>

<i>It kind of looks like a doll,</i>

She's like Skipper's sister, Stripper.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-[Michelle] Oh.
{\an8}[Carson] That's what I call
Greek Goddess dressing.
{\an8}[Michelle] Let's see your clam, Pearl.
[Pearl] <i>My resort tear-away look</i>

[RuPaul] You may leave the stage.
And while you're at it,
put some Goddamn clothes on!
[Kathy laughs]
[RuPaul] Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
-[RuPaul] First up, Sasha Belle.
-Your fall look, crustacean chic.
{\an8}-It was a little overwhelming.
-[Michelle] You're doing a nude illusion.
{\an8}Why are you showing huge,
black undergarments?
I think I was confused
by the assignment.
Well, to be fair, all of the girls
were told the exact same thing.
All right, next up, Miss Fame.
{\an8}On the runway, the looks are fantastic.
They're bold.
You look frighteningly fierce.
{\an8}And I love a pointed shoulder.
Let's go back to <i>Dynasty</i> while we can.
I thought the little blue number was cute.
I just expected a little bit more.
Next up, Kennedy Davenport.
In that spring look, you are giving me
Oprah Winfrey. [imitates Oprah] Kennedy...
-Davenport!
-Yes!
I loved your Bob Mackie butterfly.
-If you readjust the girls, the nipples--
-I can't. It's the way it's painted.
-Michelle's surgeon can fix you right up.
-Yeah.
[laughter]
Next up, Tempest DuJour.
How did it feel walking the runway?
I just recently lost a ton of weight,
so doing nude body
is a cathartic moment for me today.
-Condragulations on your weight loss.
-Thank you.
On that note, your runway look tonight,
you're wrinkly, you're droopy.
You're a thin girl now.
Let's talk about your runway numbers.
I'm not a fan of quilt-like materials
because they tend to make us look bigger.
You just lost all this weight,
and you just put on 50 pounds.
Next up, Jasmine Masters.
How are you feeling up there?
I am so happy, I'm shitting out
happiness to be here.
I loved your "Cirque de So-Gay" tube
that you popped out of.
Then I was like,
"Take off the fringy thing!"
I want to see that gorgeous body.
More nudity!
And your fall look, I don't get it.
It just looks old and dated.
[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Nothing says resort
like a tunic with no pants.
And I was just like, "Oh, God, I can see
her <i>chocha</i>." That's Spanish for vagina.
You're a beautiful queen.
You've got the body.
Your contouring on the other hand...
Girl, this is not a nightclub. This is TV.
It looks like you literally
contoured on a beard.
No.
[RuPaul] Up next, Violet Chachki.
In the tartan look, when you put your
thing down, flipped it, and reversed it,
-I almost fell off of my chair.
-And speaking about a reveal...
I would've somehow liked to have seen it
jujed a little, 'cause I'm getting boy.
I actually really enjoyed
seeing your real boy body.
You had that essence of those crazy skinny
models that may or may not have boobs.
Thank you, Kathy.
Ladies, I have one final question,
and I want the naked truth.
Which queen has least
impressed you thus far?
{\an8}-Sasha?
-I'd have to say Pearl.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame?
-Jaidynn.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport?
-Trixie.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour?
-Ginger.
{\an8}-The naked truth, Jasmine.
-Sasha, because she just came out plain.
-All right, Kandy Ho?
-Tempest. He is mature,
but I think in drag, you have
to upgrade yourself to not bore people.
Interesting. When we did introductions
the first day, she didn't say hello.
Her first response was, "How old are you?"
I wanted to know your age because you look
older, and your look wasn't my favorite.
I just wanted to know
where you were coming from. That's it.
-All right, Violet Chachki?
-Sasha.
-She kind of faded into the background.
-How did I fade into the background?
-I wore a lobster dress.
-[laughter]
Well, thank you, ladies.
Now, while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Okay, now, just between us
gay icons, what do you think?
-[RuPaul] <i>Sasha Belle.</i>
-Her nude-illusion look was kind of messy.
That body suit sucked.
Come on.
It had a black bra.
Misunderstanding, my ass!
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
-The fall-spring looks made a statement.
She's just so pretty.
I like a little stank on my drag queens.
The proportions of Miss Fame's body
reminded me of Marlene Dietrich
in the later years.
-She had a little stank on her then.
-Yes.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-I just ate her with a spoon.
She might get a little costume-y.
-Why is that a bad thing on a drag queen?
-No, I--
It's not like a star-trooper costume
from Party City.
I'd like to see that.
<i>Tempest DuJour.</i>
Her body suit was all saggy.
I wish she could pull it all together.
-But here's the thing, she's a costumer.
-Yeah.
The style's wrong, but the heart is right.
[RuPaul] <i>Jasmine Masters.</i>
I love the sassy kind of sister
with the NeNe Leakes hair.
-But the other outfit was so wrong.
-I want to see some fabulousness.
-Is that too much to ask for on this show?
-[all] No.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>
-Girl, are you painting on a beard?
I had a beard once. She was wonderful,
but I don't bring her here.
[laughter]
Kandy Ho, Kandy who?
Look, don't you talk
to a 53-year-old comedian about age.
You picked the wrong panel, bitch.
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
Her fashion looks were high fashion,
and that's what I want to see here.
Tonight, I am getting boy
with a tape tuck.
I could not disagree with you more.
She took a risk!
-It wasn't feminine enough.
-[RuPaul claps]
Silence! I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kennedy Davenport,
you're safe.
Violet Chachki, on the runway
and on the main stage,
you took fashion risks,
and they paid off big time.
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
You'll receive a gag-worthy supply
of DKoye the product, hair care.
[applause]
{\an8}Yay, I won! I'm the winner.
I feel like I'll be saying that a lot.
Miss Fame,
you're safe.
Sasha Belle,
you're safe.
[sobbing]
Tempest DuJour, your runway presentation
left the judges feeling...
crabby.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Kandy Ho,
your fashion looks were worn,
and your nude illusion was,
shall we say, overshadowed.
Jasmine Masters,
your personality is off the hook,
but your runway fashions
looked off the rack.
Jasmine Masters,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Kandy Ho, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}What the fuck?
I did an amazing job.
There are other girls
who should have been in my place.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
[dramatic music]
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life!
{\an8}[Tempest] <i>I'm thinking to myself,</i>
<i>"Hold your head up high.</i>

{\an8}[Violet] I feel
I've been through the ringer.
{\an8}-It's so weird to see you over there.
-I know!
{\an8}Girl, that was crazy.
Ever since we started this challenge,
{\an8}I've not really been in a good place.
I've been in my head.
{\an8}This was my wake-up call.
Ginger, you're better than this.
{\an8}You need to make sure
you pull it together.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>That's okay.</i>
{\an8}-[Violet] Welcome back.
-[Ginger] Welcome.
{\an8}-[Pearl] Oh, my god.
-Thank you, guys.
{\an8}I'm back and I deserve to be here.
I'm gonna kill the next challenge.
-Thanks, Pearl, for helping me get back.
-[Violet] Why did you bring that tramp?
I can feel the sisterhood.
{\an8}Should have been the top six,
but we have a top seven, thanks to Trixie.
-You better bring your A game.
-It's a war, bitch.
You can smell the resentments,
as much as you can smell Violet's BO.
I'm pissed off, to be honest with you
and this is not a read on you
but if I walked out there
with a dress I just picked,
they would have clocked me
for not trying hard enough.
{\an8}I'm not on the same page as Pearl.
She's been relaxing.
I came here to play, and to win.
All you can do is chill the fuck out
and just do you.
It's working for me.
The dynamics have changed
since Trixie went home.
{\an8}Some people are falling to pieces,
some people are rising to the top.
{\an8}Some people are cruising

-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi!
Ladies, y'all went through it
during our little reunion last week.
So listen, this is a good time to vent...
o-fficially.
Now, in the great tradition
of <i>Paris is Burning,</i>
the library is about to be open, hey!
-Because reading is what?
-[all] Fundamental.
-That's right, children.
-Mm-hmm.
First up, Ginger Minj.
The library is open, darling.
Okay. Trixie Mattel.
Making fun of you
is like shooting clownfish in a barrel.
Unfortunately,
that's about as fishy as you'll ever be.
Miss Fame,
I think everything about you is original,
except for those lips,
those cheeks and, oh...
everything you present
to the judges on the runway.
You bitch!
Pearl, you've come out of your shell,
maybe you could use that as a butt pad?
-[RuPaul] Ooh.
-[laughter]
Violet Chachki,
you keep training those corsets, girl.
Pretty soon, your waist size
will be lower than your IQ.
Miss Fame,
you are such a talented makeup artist.
I never met anybody who's able to shove
their head so far up their own ass
without smudging their eyeliner.
Ginger Minj, I disagree with the judges.
You should bring your black hairspray
down further, full coverage.
-[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Ooh!
Katya, at this point, you should just make
like your hairline and recede.
Trixie Mattel, haute couture?
More like haute glue.
-[laughter]
-That was good.
Is that... Ben Affleck?
I must be hungry for the dick
if I think this thirsty bitch is her.
[chuckles]
Katya, now you get to increase
your hooking fee.
Thank you, <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Fame, she wasn't funny.
It was like... crickets.
And you like...
[crickets chirping]
Miss Trixie, girl, I am waiting
for you to change that lip color,
'cause your face looks like
the back of a baboon's ass.
[laughter]
Oh, look, it's a giraffe.
No, it's a horse.
Oh, it's just Miss Violet,
serving her [neighs] realness.
Katya, where do you get your outfits?
American apparently not?
Ginger Minj, did you ever save Carol Anne
from the poltergeist in the TV?
Violet, I don't believe the rumors,
 that you took Sharon Needles' crown.
I don't believe
you're taking this one either.
Kennedy Davenport.
You've got your eye on the prize.
And the other eye on the crown.
Katya, are you confused?
The saying is,
"Young, dumb, and full of cup."
-RuPaul...
-Bitch.
The library is closed
and Pearl, the door is over there.
I'm gonna post
all of my favorite reads on logotv.com.
The winner of today's mini challenge is...
-Trixie Mattel!
-[applause]
I'm back.
Trixie Mattel has way more up her sleeve.
You've won
a $500 gift card from SequinQueen.
Thank god.
This week, we are paying tribute
to the Sultan of Sleaze,
The Baron of Bad Taste,
the legendary director John Waters.
Awesome.
From his early cult classics
like <i>Pink Flamingos</i>
to his mega hit <i>Hairspray</i>,
{\an8}<i>John worked with one of my idols--</i>
<i>the late, great Divine.</i>
{\an8}<i>And when these two worked together,</i>
<i>they made magic. Take a look.</i>
<i>I am Divine!</i>
{\an8}[pants]
{\an8}[screams]
[laughter]
Now, I hope you take
some Divine inspiration from that
because for this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be screen testing
for parts in a new Rusical
based on some
of John Waters' most iconic scenes.
{\an8}#JohnWaters4Ever.
{\an8}So I'm gonna give you a quick moment
to break into three teams.
Go ahead.
[laughter]
Pearl, me, and Violet
looked at each other and we're "ugh".
[Fame] <i>We didn't choose to be together.</i>
<i>We were the remnants left.</i>
None of us excel
in these kind of challenges.
Ladies,
we're providing wigs from Weaven Steven.
You know, to help get you into character.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Our scene is called Cha Cha Heels,
and it's based on <i>Female Trouble</i>.
Can I be Dawn?
I wanted to be Dawn Davenport,
because it's a bigger part,
and I see opportunities
to just go over the top.
You know, Dawn is singing.
You can sing, right?
-No.
-[laughter]
-But aren't they all singing?
-Dawn is the most singing.
So we start listening to the music,
and she start hearing
those notes that Dawn was singing...

{\an8}Oh, my god.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi.
{\an8}-Hey, ladies.
-[both] Hi.
{\an8}Who's playing Divine,
and who the mother?
{\an8}-Divine. Mother.
-[Ru] Okay.
-Now, Kennedy, you're a singer.
-Yes.
-Do you sing?
-[laughs] No.
And it was so funny
'cause she was like, "Can I be Dawn?"
-I start hitting the notes. She said...
-We gotta switch.
Last week, you were criticized
for bringing too much pageantry,
so this challenge
could force you out of your comfort zone.
{\an8}This is another opportunity
for me to display a different side of me,
so there's no pageant here, baby.
{\an8}-Hi Ginger. Hi, Trixie.
-Hi, Ru.
{\an8}-Are you familiar with Divine's work?
-Mm-hmm.
{\an8}When I was younger,
I convinced my grandmother
that <i>Pink Flamingos</i> was for children,
and I wanted to be Divine.
That was a changing point in my life.
[RuPaul] Well, she was
the first drag superstar.
Now, I know that you sing. Do you sing?
-I sing.
-So this is gonna be a breeze for you.
We're gonna top
our own expectations of ourselves.
Neither of us
have ever topped anything before, so...
-Well, can't wait to see it.
-Me either.
All right, ladies, gather round.
In moments, you'll be screen testing
with the help of Michelle Visage
-and composer Lucian Piane.
-[applause]
And tomorrow on the main stage,
the category is...
-"Ugliest dress ever."

So good luck and by all means,
fuck it up.

when the bitch before me

All right, let's see
what John Waters thinks of these tomorrow.
{\an8}-[Fame] Yay.
-Ugliest dress, it's finally my week.
{\an8}This week's runway look
is "the ugliest dress ever".
How did you choose your ugliest dress?
I mean, did you just go...
And pull it off the rack?
-Are you feeling good?
-Yes, really good.
Don't trust that feeling.
I already lip synced once,
I don't want to do it again.
{\an8}I'm worried because when someone gets
brought back, they immediately go home.
<i>And I am not ready to go home.</i>
She's going real soft today.
[Fame] I like how you block out
your hairline to put dark brown over...
It gets rid of the texture.
Do I talk to you
about how you do your makeup?
-No, but you should be.
-[Pearl] You're an idiot.
Bitch, you're very blessed, your talents
have taken you far, and I'm struggling.
[Pearl] It's okay,
your insecurities can take you there.
And your lack of will to be here
has really gotten you far.
{\an8}When it comes to Fame,
anyone could read her,
and she's like oh... [rolls tongue],
like, totally joins in, it's cute.
But, like, the second I would,
I always felt
some weird underlying tension.
I don't know. She's, like, odd.
What's been your big struggle with drag?
Well, my whole career has been a struggle.
[Kennedy]
It's my primary source of income.
The bookings are very scarce.
Drag, it barely paid the bills.
I have no retirement. I have nothing.
It's just a lot of sacrifices being made
because you wanted to pursue
your dream as an entertainer.
{\an8}A full time job
as a female impersonator is not easy,
<i>especially when you have bills to pay.</i>
But I stuck with drag
because entertaining is my passion.
It's the life of a working artist.
It's hard, but satisfying and exciting.
I cannot believe
John Waters is gonna be here.
Him and Divine are such legends.
It's crazy.
When I started doing drag,
I started seeing those movies,
and it made me feel like it was okay
to be as un-beautiful as I wanted to be.
I always liked to be shocking and funny
before I be pretty.
-We know.

-[man] Cut!
-I'm so glad that's over.
I'm starving.
You got anything good around here to eat?
-Absolutely filthy.
-[laughter]
All right, my Divine dolls,
time for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
I don't think your look is ugly enough.
It's kind of old lady chic.
As Dawn Davenport,
you lived up to your name perfectly.
The rage was there.
It was very much a tribute to me.
-I was flattered.
-It's an honor.
You know, Kennedy,
it wasn't until just now
I realized you played Dawn Davenport,
and you are Kennedy Davenport.
-[boing]
-Welcome.
[laughter]
Next up, Katya.
You went beyond playing the straight
mother and added a new layer of filth.
You did a beautiful obscenity,
so I wanted to congratulate you.
As for this outfit... ugh, those colors.
They just... give me life.
It's all really ugly. Well done.
But I think the hippest girl in Brooklyn
would love that dress and wear it today.
All right, next up, Ginger Minj.
[Michelle]
Tonight, the color is horrendous.
Your performance as Edie
was a masterpiece.
[John] There was moments
when it looked exactly like her.
-She had some loveliness that you played.
-Thank you.
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
To me, it's not terribly ugly.
There's leopard print in there, so--bing!
I think I might have actually worn this.
It's from the Gunny Sacks catalogue, 1986.
You know, in this scene in the movie,
Divine isn't angry,
so I thought there was a moment of pathos.
-You did that well.
-Thank you.
But I do feel
like Ginger outshined you a little bit.
[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
Your dress
is the least ugliest out of everyone's.
I'm not gonna lie. I feel cute.
With your performance,
you knew your lines.
A bit hesitant.
We're getting down to the wire here.
-Yeah.
-So you need to go forth at this point.
Yes. I didn't even understand
you were supposed to be the good Divine.
[RuPaul] Next up, Violet Chachki.
On your runway look,
more than anybody on this stage,
you nailed this challenge
because you're giving us ugly.
-It's a talent.
-Your performance as Divine.
Out of the group,
you looked the most authentic.
But I didn't quite understand the padding.
If you were gonna go full Divine, do it.
I thought the performance
was a little bit flat for me,
just because it didn't seem to me
you had your confidence with the material.
[RuPaul] Up next, Miss Fame.
Miss Fame, you need ugly lessons.
Because that dress, to me,
is incredibly elegant.
The performance wasn't my favorite.
It was put on so much.
As an actress, you don't have to say,
"Look at me, I'm bad!"
It should come naturally.
[RuPaul] At this point in the competition,
I have to ask the question:
who deserves to go home tonight and why?
-Kennedy Davenport.
-I would have to say Fame.
Because clearly, the struggle is real.
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-I would probably say Fame.
She's been in the bottom consistently
over the past three or so weeks.
-Ginger Minj.
-I would have to agree and say Fame.
I don't know
how much more she has to offer.
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-Fame.
She dropped the ball
on her look and her performance.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-I love her...
But I'd probably have to agree
just based on not winning a challenge yet.
-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
-Trixie got to come back.
She should be looked at
with a magnifying lens, it should be her.
All right, Miss Fame,
I want to hear from you.
Fuck all these bitches.
Truth be told, there's this part of Pearl
that's too cool for season seven,
and that frustrates me
because I'm fighting to stay.
-She knows what I'm talking about.
-I don't.
I don't think
I'm too cool for season seven at all.
I'm actually really surprised
to hear that from her.
Well, my queens,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us filthy, dirty girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
She was hilarious. She had the anger.
She could look like a church lady and go
to a rage-filled Divine at the same time.
Even though she was doing Dawn Davenport,
she was still putting her flavor into it.
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Katya was certainly ugly drag tonight.
Her performance,
she took this really kind of nothing role
and turned it
into something meaty and substantial.
She was not afraid to play not glamorous.
A lot of drag queens I know
are afraid to do that.
You were looking at me when you said that.
All right, moving on. Ginger Minj.
She embodied Edith Massey as the egg lady.
She really did go balls deep.
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-As Babs, she did a good job.
It still wasn't enough
compared to what Ginger was doing.
-It's hard to compete with a Ginger Minj.
-I've tried.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-She's doesn't give a lot when performing.
That outfit--not only is it not ugly,
it's incredibly flattering for her.
So she does not follow directions.
Violet Chachki.
That was the ugliest dress.
[Michelle] She's posed in it,
like when Lucille wore a potato sack.
That moment of "I'm fabulous."
I think her performance was about
as talented as a colorblind makeup artist.
-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-She has something that I root for.
When she said, "Fuck those bitches,"
I was like, "Okay, I like her."
-Her ugly dress was not ugly.
-The performance was ugly.
If I told her to change something, "no".
She hears, but she doesn't listen.
You know who the star of that scene was?
The dog!
Silence! I made my decision.
Bring back my pussy willows.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kennedy...
you're safe.
Thank you.
Katya, you're safe.
Ginger Minj.
This week, you gave us green... eggs...
-And hammed it up.
-[laughs]
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
Thank you.
[RuPaul] You've won a hair-raising
custom wig wardrobe
from Weaven Steven.
{\an8}Oh, my god, I won another challenge.
{\an8}I'm the first bitch this season
to win three.
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-You're safe, <i>huevos ranchero</i>.
-Thank you.
Pearl, your dress
was not a sight for sore eyes.
And your Divine performance
was a little B.M.,
Barely Memorable.
Violet Chachki,
your ugly dress made us happy.
But your Divine performance
was kinda crappy.
Miss Fame, your ugly dress
had too much beauty
and your Divine performance
was a real doody.
Violet Chachki...
[sighs]
You're safe.
Thank you.
Pearl, Miss Fame, I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both up for elimination.
{\an8}She called me out. I'll send her packin'.
[RuPaul] Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip sync performance
of "Really Don't Care" by Demi Lovato.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
-The time has come...
-[thunder claps]
...to lip sync...
...for your life!
[Fame] <i>I hate we had to have this energy,</i>
<i>but I have to fight to be here,</i>
{\an8}and I hope and pray that I get to stay.
Good luck, ladies. And don't...
fuck it up.

I didn't expect it to be so challenging,

{\an8}Whoo!
{\an8}Aaah!
{\an8}Wrong note, sugar. Shut up!
{\an8}I said, "Haunted house."
You have the look down 100%.
What was missing was everything else.
Don't come as Chaka's sister.
That's all she has to say about that.
Kennedy Davenport, Ginger Minj,
first tie in Snatch Game herstory.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, shantay, you stay.
Max, sashay away.
-Oh, my God.
-Ooh, child.
"Love you, darlings."
My Max is gone. I'm so sad.
-It's getting real now.
-It is.
Can we talk about what RuPaul said
at the end about someone coming back?
I fear I've let
one of the eliminated queens go home...
...too soon.
-I want Jasmine to come back.
-I don't!
She's been gone for too long
to come back now.
-What about Kandy Ho?
-She can't lip-sync four times.
{\an8}How can I say this delicately?
I don't want anybody to come back.
Nobody wants that.
<i>Nice to know you. You're beautiful.</i>

Come on out, company.
Latrice! It's like seeing Sharon Stone,
except, you know...
fat and black.
[RuPaul] Ladies, let's face it.
Competing on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is a lot like being in a women's prison.
So, for today's mini challenge, you need
to prove that "orange is the new drag".
Oh, pit crew!
-[Pearl] How sexy.
-[RuPaul] Hey, Latrice,
would you like to inspect
the pit crew's underwears?
Get those nuts away from my face.
All right, kitty girls, you need
to drag up these prison uniforms
using supplies from the commissary...
plus any contraband that you smuggled in.
You have 20 minutes.
Ready, set... Attica!
Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison for Ladies.
[Latrice] Drag queen walking.
You angry, ain't you? Just mad.
-I never expected to be in jail.
-Looking the way you look,
you didn't think that was a crime?
Do the time, don't let the time do you.
Don't drop the soap.
[RuPaul] All right, time's up, ladies.
It's time for the Tuckahoe Prison
fashion show.
First up, Ginger Minj.
But the others call her Wide Receiver.
{\an8}-[Latrice] I know that's right.
-[RuPaul] She's in here for burning bush.
Her dream conjugal visit
would be from the NBA.
The whole NBA.
Kennedy Davenport,
A.K.A. Ho 'N' Good Stuff.
-[Latrice] Working that side ponytail.
-[RuPaul] Sure is.
Her prison job is washing
tray underwear and cooking ramen noodles.
Ooh, look at them ashy knees.
Next up is Pearl, A.K.A. Lil' Bitch.
-[RuPaul] I wonder who Big Bitch is.
-That would be me.
Lucky you. Her prison job is nail tech.
Actually, she did my nails.
-Does she do toes too?
-She do toes too.
Miss Fame, A.K.A. Bam-Bam,
A.K.A. Sad Eyes, A.K.A. Pinky.
She got a lot of A.K.A.'s.
Call her Sad Pink Eyes for short.
Yeah. She smuggle
weave bond inside a cake.
She do weaves? Yes, girl,
no good weave goes unpunished.
{\an8}Katya, A.K.A. Olga.
{\an8}Now, her favorite prison activity
is having gingivitis.
That explains that smell.
Dental damn, girl.
She's in here for 30 years
for smuggling geese out of the Ukraine.
Violet Chachki A.K.A. Princess.
She's a bad bitch.
Her prison job is crack dealer.
I know what kind of crack she's serving.
Hey. Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
A.K.A. Slutisha.
She's here for selling something for sale.
I know what that means.
She's from Cell Block XXX.
-[RuPaul] Oh, damn, girl.
-[Violet] Yes, Beyoncé.
[RuPaul] Yes, mommy.
Nice job, ladies.
We'll be posting all of your mug shots

of today's mini challenge is...
-Kennedy Davenport!
-Oh, my God!
{\an8}Boom. I look good in orange, don't I?
Well, thank you, Officer Latrice Royale.
-Bye, Latrice.
-Bye, girl.
Now, as I promised last week,
one of the eliminated queens
is returning to the competition.
Do you want to know who?
-No.
-Not really.
All right. Are you ready?
Come on out, kitty girl.
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no.
[shouting]
[Trixie] Oh, my God!
-Hi, Trixie.
-Hi.
Looks like I'm gonna trade some girl
some soap for some new makeup.
But wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[Miss Fame] Oh, my God!
Tempest?
-Tempest DuJour.
-Hi, Ru.
[RuPaul] Why, you old geezer.
Now, I've got this sneaking feeling
that...
-Oh, my God!
-It ain't over.
-[Jaidynn] Are you serious?
-[Sasha] What?
[laughs]
Lo and behold.
-Hey, bitches!
-What?
[Kennedy] <i>That's when all the bitches</i>
<i>start coming through the door.</i>
God damn it!
Everyone is back.
All 14 of us.
[woman screams]
Oh, my gosh.
The whole gang's back together again.
Didn't we get rid of these girls?
Why is they back?
{\an8}I'm a lil' bit con-fursed.
That's right. I invited back
all of the eliminated queens.
Which one gets to stay?
Well, that's up to you.
For this week's maxi challenge,
each of you will be paired
with an eliminated queen.
And you'll be in charge
of making her over as your twin.
-As your... conjoined twin.
-[Jaidynn] Oh, my God!
{\an8}-[Sasha] Oh, my...
-#ConjoinedQueens.
{\an8}[Violet] Real makeover.
Two queens sharing the same charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,
because the eliminated queen
in the winning pair
will return to the competition!
[RuPaul cackling]
Kennedy Davenport, since you won
the challenge, you get to pick your twin.
And then you get to pair
everybody else up.
Oh, bitch.
Damn!
-Kennedy, who's going to be your twin?
-Jasmine.
Why he got to be black?
-Who do you choose for Ginger?
-Sasha.
[Ginger] Hey, girl!
-Who do you choose for Pearl?
-Trixie.
Yay!
-Who do you choose for Miss Fame?
-Kandy.
-All right, Kennedy. For Katya?
-Kasha.
[Katya] Hello, darling.
-Who do you choose for Violet?
-Max.
[whispers] We're gonna kill this shit.
The suspense is killing me.
-Who did you pick for Jaidynn?
-Tempest.
{\an8}Kennedy knows exactly what she's doing.
I could see the cogs turning.
There's nothing physically alike
about the two of us.
And I'm not doing blackface.
Gentlemens, start your engines.
And may the best women win!
All right, I'm glad you're back.
If anybody had to come back
and be my partner, I'm glad it's you.
That's a fucking lie. I'm not happy to see
any of these bitches walk back in,
because I have fought too hard
for my spot here
to have somebody go take a vacation
to come back and join the race.
So, it seems like everybody else
will be joined at the hip or at the head.
We got to do something that stands out.
Okay, okay, we can do this.
We can make it work.
What if we connect at the boob?
Like, just share one big boob.
Yeah. No, I like it.
Yes, we need to be funny,
but we actually have to look good too.
[Ginger] Sasha Belle don't sew.
I don't sew. So...
I don't know what the hell we're gonna do
to make this sewing challenge work.
We should do something gorgeous but gross,
just like my drag.
It's pretty but nasty at the same time.
-Yeah.
-We can be beauty queens...
Like in a beauty pageant?
-Like, little kids, though.
-Yes.
-Absolutely.
-But creepy.
{\an8}There's so much to do. I'm stressed out.
But if I'm gonna be doing all of this,
I'm really happy it's for Trixie.
We can give you acne,
and I'll have perfect skin.
Yeah, okay.
-Hello, hello.
-Hi.
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited</i>.
Violet and Max.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Max, you have a chance to come back,
so the stakes are very high.
-Yes, ma'am.
-What is your strategy to win?
You know, taking Max's style
and really amping it up,
-and turn it a little tchotchke, tacky.
-So you're in the driver's seat.
-Yes, ma'am.
-You're still in the competition,
so you're calling the shots.
-Where will you be conjoined?
-We love corsetry.
We'll be completely hourglass together.
{\an8}Girl, please,
we don't need to see how small
{\an8}you can make your waist
with this damn corset every challenge.
-Get back to work.
-I.J.S. I'm just saying.
Miss Fame.
-Hi, Ru.
-Kandy Ho.
-Hi.
-You're an unlikely pairing.
-Did you all connect before you left?
-We never got a chance to connect at all.
But I wish I had a bit of Kandy.
She's fearless, and I'm full of fear.
There's an energy she exudes on stage
I need to have in my life to be better.
I said, "I wish I'd have had the chance
to get to know more about you,
and here's our chance
to really know who one another is."
{\an8}Miss Fame, she talks so much.
Her answers are paragraphs.
She's got such a balance
and a fearlessness about her.
Her energy is what I need. There's been
moments in my life where conversation,
it's like it goes right through my head,
and I want to be able to show who I am.
Girl, just shut the fuck up. Just shut up.
Miss Fame, you've talked about
being too cerebral and in your head.
-Yeah.
-And, in fact, how is your head?
-You know, I was talking with her--
-See, that's it right there.
-You missed that joke.
-I missed--
Wait a minute. Stop it.
You have to listen.
I've said that to you several times.
"How is your head?"
The answer's roaming around,
but you have to listen.
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Miss Fame, how's your head?
Fine.
Are you kidding me?
No, but knock it out of the park.
Can't wait to see you as twins.
-Thank you, Ru.
-All right.
-Ginger and Sasha.
-Hey.
Isn't this crazy? It's totally wacko.
That's kind of how I feel.
I'm not gonna lie.
So you're not happy about this.
What is your strategy to win?
We said, "Let's do something
that's completely outside of the box,
and let's be joined at the nipples."
-Ex-squeeze me?
-Exactly.
Yeah, we want huge, huge boobs.
{\an8}Y'all better not try to have no kids.
No kids gonna suck on them titties.
-This is what keeps us together.
-This is gonna be quite interesting.
Girl, I'm worried. I feel
this looming presence over me saying,
"Something's about to knock you down
to the bottom, and this might be it."
All these hoes will make me feel
like it's day one all over again.
I know, day fucking one.
{\an8}We have to make up the bitches
that went home to be our conjoined twins.
-Katya.
-Hi.
-And Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-Hello, darling.
-This is your big chance to come back.
-I know.
-So what's your idea?
-We're aging hookers from Atlantic City.
-Aging hookers?
-We were born connected by our vaginas.
-But we make do with the other orifices.
-There's several other options.
And we have worked together,
which wasn't my best work.
That's right.
I don't mean to harp on negativity,
but you two worked together
when you got booted.
{\an8}We have worked together,
and it never really flowed that well.
We want to welcome... welcome you
to the first annual Despy Awards.
I'll let you get back to work.
-You have lots of conjoining to do.
-Conjoining.
If I have to go home,
and one of those eliminated whores stays,
I'm gonna have a wonderful time
going to their house and burning it down.
-Well, Kennedy and Jasmine.
-Hey.
Jasmine, how happy are you to be back?
As happy as a ship full of sailors
and one hot hooker.
-That's real happy!
-Yes.
Why did you choose Jasmine?
We come from the same background
as far as drag is concerned.
-Okay.
-And I can make her look like me.
If you're really good,
Jasmine gets to stay.
I would really like that.
She has a lot to offer.
I hope we are the winners,
so she can come back.
-Wow.
-We gonna whip it good.
Whip these hoes' asses, honey.
-Bitch, don't fuck it up.
-Yes, ma'am.
Get back to work,
and I'll see you in a minute.
-Right.
-Right.
You see where the fire is, all right.
Bitch, I'm back up in this piece.
-Tempest and Jaidynn.
-Hey, Ru.
I got to say, of all of the twins here,
you two are the oddest couple.
Yes, honey.
-What are you planning?
-We're gonna do some disco divas,
-some disco mammas.
-Really?
Our back story
is that our mamma was the whore of 54.
And then one night, she had
multiple partners that created us.
We wanted to play on our size differences,
so my "business" is in her back.
-[Jaidynn] Like this.
-[Tempest] You can see us both.
-This time, you got to bring it double.
-Double duty.
-Duty, duty, duty.
-Yes.
-Hashtag "double duty."
-Okay.
-We ready, boo.
-Get back to work.
-All right.
-Thanks, Ru.
We have to slay this,
because I ain't going home.
-Pearl and Trixie.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-Together again.
-I know.
-Again.
Let's see. Trixie, what more
do you have to show us?
Before I left in a lip-sync accident,
I was told by the judges,
"You're funny, but you're not going for
gold." And so that's what I want to do.
Every chance you step out on that stage
is your chance to do it.
There are no dress rehearsals in life.
You've got to take those opportunities.
-So what's the strategy?
-There's always a prettier twin.
-Yeah.
-That's us.
We want to look related,
but possibly in an in-breeding accident.
All right, you kids get back to work.
Cannot wait to see your conjoined twins.
{\an8}I'm bringing everything I had before
with new fire under my ass,
because I know what it's like
to fucking lip-sync and go home.
It's not cute. It's not cute at all.
{\an8}[Violet] Is this you guys
making it sexy? Or very slutty.
That was a compliment, not a read.
Now I tell people when it's a compliment.
-You have changed the most.
-Do you think so?
-That was sarcasm.
-No, in a positive way.
{\an8}I am most impressed
with the change in Violet. I'm blown away.
{\an8}She's much nicer. She's not just biting
and sending out insults.
She's a contender,
and I think that's a great thing.
[Sasha] Temp, I'm so happy to see you.
{\an8}Can I get a cut?
[Sasha] Ooh, I like that fabric.
-Girl.
-[Sasha] How's the game been for you?
I'm pulling the look together
for the both of us. We should be a team.
-[Sasha] Are you insane yet?
-I was gagged.
[Violet] You have no idea.
Come with me.
I need to take a moment
to process my feelings
before I go all Yosemite Sam and explode.
I love Sasha, but she's not pulling
her weight. I'm not a sewer's sewer.
-I'm not good enough for two people.
-Yeah.
If I went home,
I wouldn't expect to be brought back.
They went home for a reason.
I'm just freaked out.
{\an8}[Jasmine] She look
like her nerves are bad.
{\an8}-Who?
-Ginger.
{\an8}She don't want none of us back.
This is the most nervous I've seen Ginger.
She's almost completely shutting down.
If I go home, I want it to be
because of something I did or didn't do.
We've really got to do something
to pull this together
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Back in the messy workroom.
Come on, wig.
{\an8}Today is our conjoined twin runway.
Someone's staying,
and it could possibly be Max.
-Are you ready for the challenge?
-I'm ready, honey.
-We're gonna be sickly now.
-Yes.
{\an8}It's awesome to be back
with my bitch Jasmine.
But she's been a lot of sadness
ever since she left.
I told her to hold her head up.
You still have your dignity.
You still are Jasmine Masters.
And Jasmine tells me that no one
has ever told her to keep her head up.
Bitch, if I get back up in here,
I'm slaying, bitch.
I ain't holding my shit back.
She had a bad run,
but everybody deserves a second chance,
and I do believe she has
a lot to offer this competition.
-Has anyone ever painted you before?
-No, especially someone who looks like me.
I'm thinking about what my sweet...
devout Mormon mother
is gonna be thinking about all this.
-She's never seen the show but...
-Oh, yeah?
I did the whole reparative therapy thing,
trying to turn straight.
-Oh, dear!
-Yeah.
I did the whole conversion
to be straight therapy.
It was horrible. It's all about,
"You've got to pray harder, fast harder,
and date girls." Like it's suddenly
gonna turn you straight.
-Damn.
-It nearly destroyed me.
{\an8}Talking about personal issues
and upbringings gives us an opportunity
to show those kids who are struggling
that there's someone who can empathize.
You know the suicide rate in gay kids
is way above the national average, right?
-It...
-It breaks your heart.
-It's crazy.
-It destroys lives.
Lucky for you, you had a realization
about who you were in reality.
It's kind of a miracle, and it's something
I'm really grateful for every day.
If you can help one kid
live another day, then it's worth it.
[Miss Fame] Is your mom
the closest person you have?
-Oh, yeah.
-Was she a single mom?
No. They broke up when I was young,
but she's been married for 16 years.
-[Trixie] Talking about your family?
-[Kandy] My step-father.
[Trixie] I had a step-dad too,
but we weren't close.
He was super abusive. I was over it.
The police actually took me out
of my home when I was 15.
-That's pretty sad.
-Yeah, it kind of sucked.
You don't really have a clear perception
of abuse, because it's all you know.
Right, exactly.
{\an8}I had a hard time with my step-dad.
If I was being too sensitive or acting
too feminine, he would call me a trixie.
For years, that was one of the worst words
I could think of, so I took that name
and it used to have all this hurt to it,
and I made it my drag name,
and now it's something I celebrate.
If I hadn't gone through all that shit,
Trixie Mattel might not even exist.

♪ <i>Now sissy that walk</i> ♪
{\an8}[RuPaul] First up,
Miss Fame and her twin, Kandy Ho.
{\an8}[Michelle] Sexy, sexy sutures.
This look is a staple on the runway.
[RuPaul] Yes.
[Miss Fame] <i>I'm in love with</i>
<i>this fierce surgical sisters look.</i>
<i>I'm giving you full surgical realness.</i>
[RuPaul] Conjoined twins are like buses.
You don't see one all day,
and then two come at once.
[Michelle] Exactly.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce
and her twin, Tempest DuJour. Disco divas.
Tempest is my plus-one.
[Jaidynn] <i>We done tripped out of Studio 54</i>
<i>right onto the runway. Get into the disco.</i>
[Tempest] <i>I feel like a pioneer woman</i>
<i>who's being pulled by an oxcart.</i>
[LeAnn] Jaidynn, don't have
Mexican for dinner.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport and her twin,

Take that, Tia and Tamara.
[Kennedy] <i>We are giving</i>

<i>Cotton Club realness.</i>
[Michelle] One Beyoncé short
of a Destiny's Child.
[LeAnn] Oh, my gosh.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Pearl and her twin,
Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}Come on, let's go.
[RuPaul] Mama always said
Pearl was the pretty one.
[Michelle] And she wasn't lying.
[Pearl] <i>We're doing this weird routine</i>
<i>where she won't cooperate.</i>
[Trixie] <i>I'm taking every opportunity</i>
<i>to reach for the joke.</i>
<i>I need to show the judges</i>
<i>that they made a mistake.</i>
-[RuPaul] Trixie, how's your head... gear?

♪ <i>Now sissy that walk</i> ♪
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Miss Fame
and her twin, Kandy Ho.
It's been done a few times,
the whole plastic surgery thing.
I agree. It's the least creative
of the conjoining, just at the hip.
Miss Fame, how's your head?
I've never had any complaints.
Got it!
-I am so proud of you.
-It took me weeks!
Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce
and Tempest DuJour.
Your legs stretch up to the heavens.
-Are you talking to me?
-Yeah.
I thought the concept was really cute.
It's a bit basic.
It's a tough stage
for y'all to be on tonight.
[RuPaul] Next up,
Kennedy Davenport and Jasmine Masters.
I know you're both pageant girls,
which is why this is predictable for me.
Michelle, I just disagree.
You walked out here,
and you held your poise and your face,
but in that great kind of stupid I love.
We was thinking
Miss Ella and Miss Billie Holiday meet up,
and we're fighting for the mic,
and she always singing my note.
When you describe that, I totally get it.
I wish you would have brought that more.
Next up, twisted sister Pearl
and her twin, Trixie Mattel.
Good evening,
distinguished panel of judges.
This storyline is magical. I can't look
without cracking up at you, Trixie.
That's to your detriment, Pearl.
She's stealing the show from you.
It was nice to see Trixie shine.
And Pearl, you were in there with it.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Violet and her twin, Max.
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, yeah!
It took Violet to get Max
to give me what I wanted.
-Honestly, I'm feeling this.
-She's gorgeous!
-I thought y'all told your story.
-Thank you so much.
But there was a lot of pressure to do
something that would make us bust a gut.
-And you didn't do that.
-Next up, Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle,
A.K.A. A Tale of Two Titties.
I love the idea.
I'm not crazy about the execution.
There's something white on the bottom
of your boobs, Ginger. What is it?
It might be hot glue.
I hot-glued this to me.
The boobs,
I wish they looked more like breasts.
Next up, Katya and her twin,
Mrs. Kasha Davis.
Listen, she's older than dirt,
but I know true talent when I smell it.
And she smells
like she just pissed herself.
I haven't laughed as hard
as I did tonight when you guys came up.
I've seen these women up at the casino
at the slot machines.
-The casino, the bingo hall.
-Yes!
-Sometimes you got to get ugly to win.
-High five. Ugly-beautiful.
-Miss Fame did our makeup. Can you tell?
-I know, she's so good!
Thank you, Katya. Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Between us quintuplets, what do you think?
Let's start with Miss Fame and Kandy Ho.
In this season, we've seen
a plastic surgery thing already.
Really, that's the best that you can do?
It's too easy, and the stakes
are too high to go so basic.
<i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce and Tempest DuJour.</i>
Standing next to the other queens
on this stage, it didn't stack up.
I wanted something more
and I think they could have brought it.
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport</i>
<i>and Jasmine Masters.</i>
I wish they'd gone over the top
with crowns, sashes, and flowers
and did the whole thing, over the top.
If they had connected at the head
or something a little weirder,
it would have worked better.
-[RuPaul] <i>Pearl and Trixie Mattel.</i>
-They were absolutely stunning.
-How fun was this?
-They were the best storytellers.
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki and Max.</i>
-They could've gone over the top,
but it would have taken away
from their beauty.
The biggest moment was me seeing Max
in a different light, and I loved that.
[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle.</i>
I couldn't get past the costume,
the construction.
I don't think I minded how shoddy it was
because it looked a bit like John Waters,
and that was always low-budget.
-But he attitude didn't sell that.
-It just felt, no pun intended, flat.
[RuPaul] <i>Katya and her sister,</i>
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>
They brought the funk and the fun.
They brought the house down.
-Not to mention they were conjoined...
-[both] At the vagina!
-[Ross] <i>Yeah.</i>
-What's better than that?
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Pearl, as a conjoined twin,
the judges found you creepy and sad.
Pearl, condragulations.
You are the winner of this challenge.
Trixie Mattel, that means
you're back in the race, girl.
{\an8}I'm back, yay! I thought I was,
"Fourth episode, queen, bye."
I thought I was Mimi Imfurst.
Now I'm, "Me, me, I'm second chance."
Pearl, you've won your very own
custom website from Squarespace,
-plus a fabulous weekend in New York...
-Oh, hey!
...where you'll meet
with the Squarespace team
-to make your portfolio and online store.
-Yes!
{\an8}This story has come full-circle,
taking Trixie out and bringing her back.
-Katya, you're safe.
-Thank you.
-Kennedy Davenport, you're safe.
-Yes!
Jaidynn, your disco inferno
did not set the judges' pussies on fire.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
Violet Chachki.
-You're safe.
-Thank you.
Miss Fame,
your plastic surgery story needed work.
Ginger Minj, you served tatas with hahas,
but the execution was... wah-wah.
Ginger Minj, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}Frankly, I'm not surprised.
Stevie Wonder could see this one coming.
[RuPaul] Miss Fame, you're safe.
Two sets of conjoined queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourselves...
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life!
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

and last name should be Fierce.
Your passion brought you here.
Share it with the world.
Now, sashay away.
Thank you so much. I'm just so happy

Thank you.
Thank you.
[Jaidynn] Love y'all.
I love you, baby.
Work that puss.
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm a little bit devastated,</i>
but I stayed as strong as I could,
and I learned a lot about myself.
I learned that I just want to be loved
and accepted for who I am, truly.
[RuPaul] Condragulations, ladies.
{\an8}And remember, if you can't love yourself,
how you gonna love somebody else?

that somebody else is attached to you.

1
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,867
- Oh, but, baby, you know how

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:10,000
I feel.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,033
I mean, you really want me to

4
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,266
say it?

5
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,633
[laughing] This is silly.

6
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,767
Okay, here goes.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,934
[imitating Cher]
Wagon wheel watusi!

8
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,834
[laughs]

9
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,266
You so crazy.

10
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,367
- Hey, Ru.

11
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,867
- Hey, Chaz.

12
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,166
I got that song,<i> Superstar.</i>

13
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,967
You know, the one you wanted to
rehearse for the show tonight.

14
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:34,300
- Oh, Chaz, I been so busy
selling the air rights to

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,667
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I</i>

16
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,767
- Cool.
I-I can come in tomorrow.

17
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,133
- Well, no, no.

18
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,967
Let's just get it over with.

19
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,100
Okay, you want a spot?

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,033

Snap out of it!

00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,066

<i>runway, but they did have a few</i>

49
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>catty things to say about each</i>
<i>other.</i>

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,300
Let's take a look.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,266
- What did you think about
Shangela's Tina?

52
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,100
- Shangela's Tina was okay.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,667
You know.
- Are you serious?

54
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,700
She looked like Tina Turner
after Ike beat her down.

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,100
- Was that my name?

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,767
- Yeah, we're talking about
Tina Turner, girl.

57
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,467
- This hair is not soundproof.

58
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,400
- When people are talking about
you, that means you're doing

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,467
something right.

60
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,433
What's more American than
Marilyn Monroe?

61
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,667
- Oh, my gosh, you don't look

62
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,066
anything like Marilyn Monroe.

63
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,100
You probably look like Marilyn
Manson.

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,200
[laughter]

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,433
- But not Marilyn Monroe.

66
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:43,266
- If, but--I'm not in drag, I'm

67
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,333
so quiet.

68
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,900
- You say you're quiet?

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,467
You're not quiet, bitch.
- You're not quiet.

70
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,834
- Who would you say is the
funniest person here?

71
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,166
- Like, who cracks me up the
most?

72
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,467
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.

73
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,066
I crack myself up all the time.

74
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,800
- No one ever gets your jokes
except for you.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,133
- First of all, she look like a

76
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,700
fat ass, cheap Barbie doll from
the dollar store.

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,066
- [laughing] Damn.

78
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:04,934
- If you have nothing nice to

79
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,433
say, don't say anything at all.

80
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,667
But if you nothing nice to say,

81
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,900
come sit next to me.

82
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
- I like your shoes.
They're cute.

83
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,367
- [deep voice]
Thanks, Heather.

84
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,767
You guys have the most
a-softest voices for men.

85
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:18,200
- Well, that's because you sound
like James Earl Jones, honey.

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
- Oh, fuck off,
sprepper bitch.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,066
- What do you think of Alexis'?

88
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,467
- Wow.

89
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,967
That's just gonna make her look
really thick in the middle.

90
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,433
- That is so ugly.

91
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,066
- I don't want to look like I've
been eating the cake.

92
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,834
- Raja, girl, listen, I'm gonna
give you a little bit of advice.

93
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,266
Don't ever walk into an antique
store.

94
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,667
They just might keep you, girl.

95
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,400
[laughter]

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
- I mean, even her skin is
rejecting the makeup.

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,934
It's like, some people are just
not meant to do it,

98
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,900
and if your skin is rejecting
the makeup...

99
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,500
- Your body is telling you
something.

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,700
- Your face looks so much
better; so much better.

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,633
- Uck, I know, 'cause before I
was painted like Carmen Carrera.

102
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,600
- No, before, bitch, you was
painted like a motherfucking

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,834
ghost, honey.

104
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,867
- Okay, the library's closed!

105
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,400
- Me-ow!

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
Speaking of mean girls, the

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,400
self-proclaimed popular queens,

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,133
led by Raja and Manila, formed

109
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,667
a secret clique called

110
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,367
the Heathers.

111
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,467
- She was fetch.

112
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,533
- Heather!

113
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,500
Stop trying to make "fetch"

114
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,767
work; it's not happening.

115
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:15,867
- They pitted themselves

116
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,667
against the rest of the girls,

117
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,633
who they lovingly referred to as

118
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,800
the boogers.

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
["valley girl" voice] Oh, my

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,500
god, don't you, like, totally

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
miss high school?

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
- Heather.
- Heather wants to talk to us.

123
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,633
- Come hither, Heather.

124
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,700
- Heather, what are you making?

125
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,100
- Carmen, Manila, Delta, and

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,367
myself have decided to call each

127
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,066
other Heather because we formed

128
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,400
this clique which looks a lot

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,066
- There's just Heathers and
boogers.

131
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,200
- Does anyone know why the

132
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
other girls are calling each

133
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,333
other Heather?

134
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,633
- I don't know.

135
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,667
- It's just retarded.

136
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,300
These dumb bitches.

137
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,367
- I love calling you Heather.
It's so much fun.

138
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,333
- How's your outfit going,
Heather?

139
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,533
- It's going gorgeous.

140
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:52,900
- So, Yara, are you still

141
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,066
friends with Shangela?

142
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,967
- Yes.
- We can make you a Heather,

143
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,400
but you can't talk to the other
boogaronis.

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,500
- No, I don't want to.

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,200
- I'm just kidding.

146
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
- Everybody's just playing a
game.

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,934
But I think they're going
overboard.

148
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:07,633
No, I would have never worked
with the Heathers.

149
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,467
- If anyone looks at us as being
a clique, it's just

150
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,734
because they're insecure.

151
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,633
- I don't know what they put in
the breakfast.

152
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:17,467
- Boogers.
- Relax.

153
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:18,767
- I'm so over them.

154
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,700
- We got this.

155
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,734
We're the Heathers.

156
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,767
- Thank you.

157
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,600
- Here at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,333
we don't just entertain.

159
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,834
We "edjumacate."

160
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,567
And this season, our queens

161
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,266
taught us more new words than

162
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,567
Sarah Palin, although she may

163
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,467
refudiate that.

164
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,166
The first<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> word is...</i>

165
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,233
"busted."

166
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,734
- Everybody should have the

167
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,133
right to do drag, even if they

168
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,300
look busted.

169
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,433
- When it's not polished and

170
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,700
it's not there, it's just like,

171
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,266
bitch, it looks busted, and you

172
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,400
need to fix it.

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
- And you have to not be busted

174
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,066
like miss Raja over here.

175
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,400
- Crusted and busted.

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,834
- Busted people, they don't

177
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,433
know they're busted.

178
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,133
- Busted, party of one.

179
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,233
- [laughs]

180
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,333
- These other girls are busted.

181
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,934
- If you want to know the

182
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,133
truth, you need just one letter.

183
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,333
T.

184
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,066
- Ugh, I have so much T for you.

185
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,433
- What is the T?

186
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,367
- Here's the T.
- Just give me the T.

187
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,700
- There's the T.
- What's the T?

188
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,133
- She knows the T.

189
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,633
- You spilled your T to your
mom?

190
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,700
- How do you say, "that's the
T in Spanish?"

191
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,300
- [speaks Spanish]
- What?

192
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,934
- Oh, that is not the T.

193
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:23,100
- Some queens invented
their own catchphrases.

194
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,333
- Hallelu, ladies!
Hallelu!

195
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,734
He said hallelu.
- Hallelu!

196
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,934
- Hallelu.
- Hallelu.

197
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:35,333
- Is that a read?
- Hallelu, lelu.

198
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,166
- To quote Alexis Mateo, it
should say...

199
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,500
- Bam!
- Bam.

200
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
- Bam!

201
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,100
- Love the bam in all that
stuff.

202
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,066
- Bam!
- It was bam.

203
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,900
- Ah, thank you.

204
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,367
-<i> Echa, echa, echa pa'lante!</i>

205
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,266
- Help me say it.

206
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,633
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>

207
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,700
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>

208
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>

209
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,500
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>

210
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,867
- Darling, I have one thing to
say to you.

211
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,166
<i>- ♪ Echa pa'lante ♪</i>

212
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,233
- And there were certain

213
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,800
expressions that seemed to get

214
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,533
stuck in all our heads.

215
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,900
Be a lady.
- Be a lady.

216
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,600
- Be a lady.
- "Don't be shady, be a lady."

217
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,500
- That bitch dances the house
down.

218
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,600
- He is going to ream me the
house down.

219
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,667
The house down is a drawn-out
version

220
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,734
of the exclamation point.

221
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,066
She is fierce, the house down.

222
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
- She is painted the house down.

223
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,633
- I'm padding the house down.

224
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,734
- I'm a diva, because a diva
delivers.

225
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:28,967
- Oh, so now you're delivering.

226
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,066
- Cannot walk.

227
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,233
- Oh, so, now you injured.

228
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,333
- It's really just the shoes.

229
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,734
- So now you're a drag queen?

230
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,200
- I can walk on water.

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
- Oh, so now you Jesus?

232
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,900
- [laughs]

233
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,300
- And then there's every drag

234
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,133
queen's favorite.

235
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,800
The f-word.

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,767
- Ooh, girl, you look fierce.

237
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,367
- I am fat, I am fierce.

238
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,767
- The reason you're here is

239
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,066
because you are fierce.

240
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,333
- It's like, "bitch, you look
fierce."

241
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,934
- Your Joan Crawford was not
Mildred fierce.

242
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,567
- You know there are some fierce
bitches here.

243
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,600
- She's one fierce mothertucker.

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,500
- But I think I did a fierce job
today.

245
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,133
- We're not here to be shady,
just fierce.

246
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,367
And what do you call something
that's fiercer than fierce?

247
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,066
You call it sickening.

248
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:13,200
- I am what? Sickening.
- Sickening.

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,066
- It was sickening to break him
in, honey.

250
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,400
- And by sickening, she means

251
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,100
sending people to the hospital.

252
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,367
- That's when it's, like,
sickening, girl.

253
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:23,066
- My thing is glamour and being
sickening.

254
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,100
- Thank you.

255
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,667
- One day, Alexis Mateo, I will

256
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,100
be as sickening as you.

257
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,433
- Sickening, no?

258
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,066
- Hi, and welcome back to the

259
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,400
superstar edition of

260
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,233
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

261
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,767
Now, here to help me count down

262
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,300
the most sickening fits and

263
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,200
fashions, I've invited three

264
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,767
legendary children.

265
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,367
Yes, legendary.

266
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,567
Welcome back the tasty Jujubee.

267
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,734
The mistress Raven.

268
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,734
And America's reigning drag

269
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:54,066
superstar, miss Tyra Sanchez.

270
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,533
Well, hello, my queens.

271
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,633
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, mama.

272
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,633
- Welcome back.

273
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,567
- Thank you for having us.

274
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,433
- [laughs]

275
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,867
- Now, ladies...

276
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,000
let's count down the most

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
sickening fits and fashions on

278
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
the runway.

279
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Coming in at number ten,
Manila Luzon

280
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,100
and her fluffy Christmas muff.

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
- Ooh.

282
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
- Look at the size of that muff.

283
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,433
I think she looks like this

284
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,767
exotic Russian model.

285
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,700
She looks absolutely
breathtaking.

286
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,433
- Manila Luzon, you have a muff
to die for.

287
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,734
- I think she looks fabulous.

288
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:29,567
I mean, I want that outfit for
myself.

289
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,467
It might be the only muff I put
my hands in.

290
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,533
It's cute.

291
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,867
- Coming at number nine
is Yara Sofia's

292
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,467
twisted follicle fantasy.

293
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,700
- I loved it.

294
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,834
The purse is my favorite.

295
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,567
It was, like, very hot.

296
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,567
- Yeah, she puts it together.

297
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,166
- This thing, though, I don't

298
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,333
know how that stayed on her
head.

299
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,333
- I think she looked like

300
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,166
a couture poodle.

301
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,033
Giving you hair body.

302
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:52,967
Ruff.

303
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,567
[laughter]

304
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,433
- All right, girls, coming in

305
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:02,233
at number eight, the ambush of
Shangela.

306
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,066
Who do you think should go home
tonight?

307
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,533
- I would like to see Shangela
go.

308
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,066
She's just a loudmouth, and

309
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,367
she's always talking, and

310
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,533
halleluing.

311
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:11,467
- Shangela, although your

312
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,767
personality shines, I think you

313
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,667
should be on season five or six.

314
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,667
That's where you should be.

315
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,734
- You know, you three have all

316
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:18,767
been in the workroom with

317
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,734
Shangela before.

318
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,100
- Yes.
- Is she annoying, Jujubee?

319
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,367
- I don't think she's annoying
at all.

320
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,734
She cracked me up.
- Yeah?

321
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,967
- I was mad when she left.
I wanted to see more of her.

322
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,066
So I think it was great that
she's back.

323
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,200
- Do you think that was fair

324
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,233
what Manila and Raja said to
Shangela?

325
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,533
- Well, I think everyone's
entitled to their own opinion,

326
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,066
but it just reminded me of the
wedding episode.

327
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,734
So I felt like how Shangela
felt.

328
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,433
They're entitled to say what
they want to say.

329
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,667
I think they could have said it
in a more polite way.

330
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,667
- In your case or in Shangela's
case?

331
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,100
- In both cases.
- [laughs]

332
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,200
- I'm sorry.

333
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,867
- In our number seven spot,

334
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,900
it's our cheerleading jocks in
frocks.

335
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,533
They've got spirit, yes they do.

336
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,600
They've got spirit.
How 'bout you?

337
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,667
- Whoo!
- Baby!

338
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,266
- Wrap your dick!

339
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,667
Wrap up your dick!

340
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,533
- No bareback! No bareback!

341
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,100
- Abstinence is for boogers,

342
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,333
but we love our diaphragm!

343
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,633
- Protection is the key!

344
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,133
Safe sex!

345
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,700
- These are some ladies.

346
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,200
- Well, one of 'em looked like
Juju.

347
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,400
- Okay, she was giving you body.
- Yeah.

348
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,967
- She was giving shoulders,
girl.

349
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,233
- Whatever.

350
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,633
- Raja was my favorite.

351
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:28,967
It reminded me so much
of<i> White Chicks</i>

352
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,867
when they started dancing.

353
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,467
It was just hilarious.

354
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:35,200
- I love Yara Sofia trying to

355
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,066
spell out the word "wrap," and

356
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,600
every letter, it sounds like

357
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,533
she's gonna say a different
letter.

358
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,834
- Give me the A!

359
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:43,667
- A!

360
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,066
- Give me the ah-a!

361
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,100
- A!

362
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,500
- Their performance was one of

363
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,166
the funniest things I've seen on

364
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,066
national television in a long,
long time.

365
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,333
- Safe sex, motherfuckers!

366
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,066
- Wrap that dick!

367
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,667
- Coming in at number six is

368
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:01,967
Raja from the lost tribe of
supermodels.

369
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,100
- Fabulous fierce.

370
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,834
I wish I had her body, for real.

371
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,800
There needs to be a time when
you can go, "okay, I'm gonna

372
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,700
rough it up and make this a
little edgy."

373
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,800
I wanna see that bitch do
<i>Avatar.</i>

374
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,066
-<i> Dragatar.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes.

375
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,467
- At number five, Alexis

376
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,533
Mateo's eye-popping,

377
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,467
jaw-dropping outfit from

378
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,433
the drag queens of comedy.

379
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,867
- I'm a Latina girl, and I only

380
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,700
have two options in this
country.

381
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,200
And you all know I didn't came

382
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,667
here to clean toilets, baby, so

383
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:33,066
I became a stripper, baby!

384
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,266
- I love big titties.

385
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:38,400
[laughter]

386
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,133
- Actually, last season,

387
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,333
I think you were the only queen

388
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,533
who had a breast plate.
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,066
- This season, several of the

390
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,233
girls were pumping breast
plates.

391
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:50,066
Is that a trend that's happening
around the world right now?

392
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,433
- Um, I've noticed that,

393
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,800
wherever I go now, there are
a lot of queens with it now.

394
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,967
It comes to the point where,
like, I don't even wear it as

395
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,166
much anymore because--

396
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,400
- Are you pumping the breast
plate now?

397
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,266
- No. No.
- Just natural.

398
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,734
- Just natural.
- [laughs]

399
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,066
Making the number four spot

400
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,500
on our countdown is the gift

401
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
that keeps on giving...

402
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,867
Carmen Carrera's ass.

403
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,367
- I think clothing repels off of
her.

404
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,700
You know?

405
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm like, "girl, did you get

406
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
that half off?"

407
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,567
- My dick would be really mad
as--

408
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,934
I don't know where she put it.

409
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,066
- Pissed off.
- She's got some skills.

410
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,066
- Yeah.
- In your group, Raven, were

411
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,066
there any girls who were naked
like that?

412
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,400
- I think the only one that

413
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,367
came close to that was Mystique.

414
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,400
- Yeah.

415
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm kidding.

416
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,367
[laughter]

417
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,467
- Coming in at number three is

418
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,200
Shangela, serving some

419
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,734
post-modern pimp realness.

420
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,433
- Well, you know I had a dumbass
girlfriend.

421
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,867
She came screaming at me last
week, talkin' about, "Laquifa!"

422
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:58,066
I said, "what?!"
"Where your hoes at?"

423
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,667
I said, "bitch, don't you see

424
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,433
I'm wearin' four pair of hose
right here

425
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,300
holding back my dick!"

426
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
- That bitch is hilarious.

427
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,734
I can watch that over and over
again.

428
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:10,066
- It was very well thought out.

429
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,600
Everything that she did.

430
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,567
The way she puts her hand on
her, "I'm also my own ho."

431
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,066
I absolutely loved it.

432
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,567
- Coming in at number two on

433
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,900
the most sickening fits and

434
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,233
fashions involves miss India

435
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:25,533
Ferrah getting a bit carried
away.

436
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,400
- If that were me, if that was
me carried away...

437
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,567
Mimi would have been
drop-kicked.

438
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,633
- Uh-oh.

439
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:32,667
- I would have got kung fu on
her.

440
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,166
- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

441
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,934
It crosses a line, and it shows
your desperation.

442
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,567
- First and foremost,
be a lady.

443
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,166
- Keep it cute.
- Keep it cute.

444
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,166
- Yes, ma'am.

445
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,300
- Now, what would you have done

446
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,667
in that situation?

447
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,166
- Well, it's $75,000 that

448
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,266
you're giving away, and you

449
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,667
don't want to go home.

450
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,834
You want to be there and you

451
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:50,867
want to win.

452
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,800
So, in her mind, she's thinking,

453
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,066
"I can't go home.

454
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,300
I cannot go home."

455
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,100
- But I will say India handled

456
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,133
it very well.

457
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,600
When she was finally put down,

458
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,834
she did her thing.

459
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,233
I will say props to India.

460
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:07,300
And I love India's mug.

461
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,934
- And now, the moment we've all

462
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,600
been waiting for, the coveted

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,400
number one spot on our
countdown.

464
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,567
The most sickening of them all
goes to...

465
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,700
Who could it be?

466
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,633
Isn't anybody gonna interrupt
me?

467
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,100
- Hold on, now, Ru.

468
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,133
The top spot belongs to...

469
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,300
- Ahggh...

470
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,533
- You!

471
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,300
- Me?! What?

472
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,900
What are you talking about?

473
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,066
Are you telling me that I'm

474
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:38,533
number one three years in a row?

475
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,533
- Three years in a row.

476
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,967
- Is that a record?

477
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,400
Susan Lucci, eat your heart out.

478
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,166
- My favorite was
your Barbie look.

479
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,633
You came out and you were like,
"okay."

480
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,400
- Valley girl.
- Oh, yes.

481
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,734
- Where I was going as a black

482
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,533
woman for the first time in my
life.

483
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,367
I was portraying a black woman.

484
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:06,266
- You nailed it.
- Do you think so?

485
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,867
- Did a really good job.
- Oh, good, thank you.

486
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,066
Thank you.

487
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,367
Raven, what was your favorite
look?

488
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,266
- The one where you're in the
black and yellow dress.

489
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,100
- That's the glamazon with the
Mohawk story going.

490
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,934
- Yes.

491
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:17,967
- It was gorgeous.

492
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,133
- And, Tyra, what about me?

493
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,667
What about RuPaul?

494
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,266
What I want to know is what

495
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,934
dress would you want to mock?

496
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,166
- It's like a peach color.

497
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,467
- Yeah, it's got the dandelion
big--

498
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,433
- All over, I think I'd want to
mock that one.

499
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,133
- Very ra-cha-cha.

500
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,700
[laughter]

501
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,100
Well, thank you, ladies.

502
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,333
I know you'll be watching next

503
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,066
week to find out who gets

504
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,800
crowned America's next drag
superstar.

505
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,367
Thank you for chiming in.

506
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,567
Lots of luck.

507
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,333
Welcome back to the superstar

508
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,533
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

509
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,133
Now, to reach the final three,

510
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,166
Alexis, Manila, and Raja had to

511
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,266
really pump up the volume.

512
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,667
Because the ten queens who left

513
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:09,233
before them did not go quietly.

514
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,633
- Hello.

515
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,633
all: Hi!

516
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,500
<i>- Now, we barely got to</i>
<i>know Venus D-Lite.</i>

517
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,233
<i>A fierce Madonna</i>
<i>impersonator...</i>

518
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,467
<i>Venus found her holiday was cut</i>

519
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:25,867
<i>short, and quicker than a ray</i>
<i>of light, she was gone.</i>

520
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:29,467
The next queen to fly the coop
was Phoenix.

521
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:33,533
After an awkward first
impression, her psychic ability

522
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:34,667
made her team captain.

523
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,066
- Action!

524
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,700
- You've arrived in a
hermaphrodite spaceship.

525
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,500
Prepare to trannyport in three,
two, one.

526
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,600
- Phoenix, you're delivering

527
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,967
all your lines away from the
camera.

528
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,533
We need to see your gorgeous
face.

529
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,633
- Okay.

530
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:46,633
- I think you could have been a

531
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,900
little zanier, especially with a

532
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,467
name like Lady Tata.

533
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,433
<i>- But even Phoenix couldn't</i>

534
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,567
<i>predict that her performance as</i>

535
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,533
<i>Lady Tata would make her the</i>

536
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,500
<i>second queen to leave the race.</i>

537
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,066
Mimi Imfurst...

538
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,500
- Welcome to my party!

539
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I brought cookies.

540
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,667
<i>- Got off to a rocky start.</i>

541
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,700
<i>Her confidence was shaken when</i>

542
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,333
<i>she tried to put the "merry"</i>

543
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,934
back in Christmas.

544
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,433
- [crying] I don't know what I
was thinking.

545
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,867
And if I have to lip-synch,
I'll

546
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,967
motherfucking lip-synch my life
off.

547
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,900
<i>- But her lively personality</i>

548
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,200
<i>soon came busting out all over.</i>

549
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Much to the annoyance of some of
the other girls.

550
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,700
- Action.
- Aah!

551
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,867
- Miss Mimi, there's a
difference in being talented...

552
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,467
and being a showboat.

553
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:39,834
<i>- Her performance from</i>

554
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:43,967
Queens from Uranus<i> received</i>
<i>some stellar reviews.</i>

555
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,133
But her workout video proved to

556
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,266
be more pain than gain.

557
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,734
- You gotta get higher!

558
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,066
Chase after your man!

559
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,166
You're gonna grab him!

560
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,600
- Oh!
- Hold him up!

561
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,867
- Cut! It's just feeling a
little disorganized.

562
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,133
- It was hokey.
It was not good.

563
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:04,100
<i>- And her lip-synch with India</i>
<i>Ferrah got way too physical.</i>

564
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,734
- Get her off of me!

565
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,867
<i>- And Mimi Imfurst was the</i>

566
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:13,367
<i>third queen to go home.</i>

567
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,900
India Ferrah arrived from Ohio

568
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,066
with an all-star reputation.

569
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,000
- Girl...prison, honey.

570
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
I look over to Phoenix copying

571
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,867
my style, so I actually had to

572
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:26,500
go up to her and be a little

573
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,266
cunt to her.

574
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,633
I love your hair.

575
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>- India's rubber boobies became</i>

576
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,166
<i>stars in their own right.</i>

577
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,166
- I thought they were just
completely believable.

578
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,100
- But the judges wanted to see

579
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
more than just jiggle.

580
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,033
- Give me more face.

581
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,834
- Okay.
- Give me more of that.

582
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:46,533
- There is a hell no storm.
Okay?

583
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:50,100
<i>- Her performance as the QNN</i>
<i>weather girl was met with an</i>

<i>arctic blast, and India was the</i>

<i>fourth to sashay away.</i>

586
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,800
This next lady boy served fish

587
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,300
like she was working at Red

588
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,533
Lobster, and we call this queen
Mariah.

589
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,633
- Prepare to gag on my eleganza.

590
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,066
<i>- One of the most flawless</i>

592
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,233
<i>Mariah's poise and</i>

00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,333
<i>self-confidence seemed like it</i>

594
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,066
<i>would carry her far.</i>

595
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,600
- When we find out that we have

596
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,700
to go out during the daytime and

597
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,967
go shopping in drag, I'm good,

598
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,266
'cause, baby, if it's right,

599
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,433
it's right.

600
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:27,700
<i>- And in the snatch game, her</i>

601
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,600
<i>impression of Joan Crawford did</i>

602
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,166
not earn her the respect she
felt entitled to.

603
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,333
- Now, that is not a wire
hanger.

604
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,567
- It's not.

605
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:38,600
- What is it?

606
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,867
- It's a wooden hanger.

607
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,800
[all groan]

608
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,166
<i>- And that led to the</i>
<i>emancipation of Mariah.</i>

609
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:52,100
It's safe to say that Stacy
Layne Matthews has put

610
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,533
Back Swamp, North Carolina, on
the map.

611
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,233
Her clone does not sleep alone.

612
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,967
- You look so much
like my relatives.

613
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,166
Is she related and I don't know
it?

614
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,300
- The back swamp Jacksons.

615
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,066
- Shake it! Ohh!

616
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,400
- Excellent.

617
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,066
- Yes! Mmm!

618

621
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,567
- Monique?

622
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:20,533
- Precious!

623
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,567
- Uh-oh.

624
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,867
Is Precious back there?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,867
Bitch knows I'm hungry as hell.

626
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,533

Stacy.

628

00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:40,533
<i>Shangela into the final three.</i>

719
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:44,600
Yara Sofia arrived from
Puerto Rico as a dark horse

720
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
in this competition.

721
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,500
- Oh oh!

722
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,767
Oh, almost burned my ass.

723
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:50,700
Oh, my god.

724
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Cha! Cha!

725
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,500
<i>Echa pa'lante!</i>

726
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,166
<i>- But her sense of humor and</i>
<i>her</i>

727
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,066
<i>joy for life proved to be</i>

728
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,700
<i>contagious in challenge...</i>

729
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,967
- Ohh!

730
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,066
<i>- After challenge.</i>

731
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:03,800
- Hyuh! [raspberry]

732
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,633
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

733
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,433
Get out, get out, get out!

734
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,233
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.

735
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,300
[laughter]

736
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,967
- Can I have some whater?

737
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,233
[laughter]

738
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,100
How'd it sound?

739
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,300
- By George, I think you've got
it!

740
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,700
- Ohh, rheally?
- Yes!

741
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,300
<i>But, forced to lip-synch for</i>

742
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,367
<i>her life against her good</i>
<i>friend</i>

743
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,300
<i>Alexis Mateo, Yara seemed to</i>

744
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,867
<i>throw in the towel too early.</i>

745
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:39,266
<i>- I'm so angry, and I'm so</i>
<i>disappointed.</i>

746
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,400
<i>I'm a mess.</i>

747
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,367
<i>- Sadly, we had to say adios.</i>

748
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:52,166
I'm so proud of each of these
incredible queens.

749
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,800
They made this competition the
stiffest one yet and really

750
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,367
forced our final three to earn
their place at the top.

751
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:04,700
Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

752
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,633
<i>This year, the judge's panel</i>
<i>was star-studded.</i>

753
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,500
- [laughs]

754
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,667
- But you didn't get to see

755
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,900
half of what goes on behind that

756
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,500
table until now.

757
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,667
Like when my best girlfriend

758
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,867
Michelle Visage and I start

759
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:20,700
kicking, things can get real
stupid.

760
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
- Seeing India tonight on the

761
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
runway was like walking into the
mall,

762
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,333
and Claire's exploded all over
her.

763
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,700
- Well, I want to see you do me;
how would you do me?

764
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,133
[laughs]

765
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:36,734
Michelle, sashay away.
- Ohh.

766
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:38,900
- You know, my personal mantra
is, it's not a party until

767
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,166
someone gets a bucket of pig

768
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,400
blood dumped on her head.

769
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,533
- Oh, that's mine too.

770
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,900
Mm, it smells like freedom
in here.

771
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,433
- Ooh, I thought I washed.

772
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,900
- [laughs]

773
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
The boy judges had their manic

774
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,066
moments too between Santino,

775
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,133
Billy B., and Mike Ruiz--

776
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,567
child, nobody was safe.

777
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,533
- She always looks beautiful,

778
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:03,166
but she looks like a beautiful
special needs child.

779
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,967
[laughter]

780
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,266
- And we love special needs
children.

781
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,500
- Some of you who do have very

782
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,467
feminine features still contour

783
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,066
the crap out of it, and you look

784
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,066
like Lil Kim before she went to
the doctor.

785
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,166
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- I'm just saying.

786
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,066
- You need to get
a refrigerator,

787
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,567
because you're going sour.

788
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,900
- Am I wilting?

789
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,600
- There's some fruit flies
buzzing around your head.

790
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,133
- Now, Billy, is it possible

791
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,967
that you are pregnant right now

792
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,066
and you don't know it?

793
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:33,433
- My shoes are wet.

794
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:34,867
I think my water just broke.

795
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,900
[laughter]

796
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,867
- You did this funny thing with

797
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:38,834
your lips when you were doing

798
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,300
the runway, this puckering
thing.

799
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,266
It looks like you were--
suck the

800
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,633
paint off a Cadillac
with those lips.

801
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,533
- Your...pie looked delicious.

802
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:49,100
And not the one you were
holding, heh heh!

803
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,867
In a whole constellation of
asses,

804
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,467
she's got the brightest ass.

805
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,400
- Thank you very much, Albert
Einstein.

806
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Santa Claus, please, keep it
quiet.

807
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,166
Thank you, Phil Donahue.

808
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,400
Now, my favorite part of the

809
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,934
show is watching our celebrity

810
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,900
guest judges, who are really

811
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,066
just big fans, get caught up in

812
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,066
the spirit of drag race.

813
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,934
And nobody goes home until

814
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:11,100
they've strutted their stuff on

815
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,667
the runway.

816
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,500
Don't be jealous of their
boogie.

817
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,066
- Not only can the judges walk
the walk,

818
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,200
they talk the talk too.

819
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,900
Here is some never-before-seen

820
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,433
footage to show you just what I
mean.

821
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,967
- I think it's extraordinary.

822
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,400
You look like Paris Hilton if
she was the Motel 6 heiress.

823
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
[laughter]

824
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,900
- I think Santa has Venus envy.

825
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,667
[laughter]

826
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:24,767
- It looks like ladies' night at
the Star Wars cantina.

827
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,567
Are you feeling intergalactic?

828
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,900
- Very intergalactic.

829
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
- That's so funny, because I'm

830
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,734
interga-lactating right now.

831
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:31,934
- Are you?

832
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:34,600
- Because that is the real T,
this girl, okay?

833
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,934
If you could put a pair of

834
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:40,000
trousers and a blazer and look

835
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,967
feminine, hon'ty, you deserve to

836
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:47,100
snatch several daytime Emmys,
okay?

837
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,433
- The walk, however.

838
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,734
It's like you do have a horse
between your legs.

839
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,100
- Apparently, he does.

840
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,266
- Your smile is absolutely
lovely.

841
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:57,433
- 15 years since I've been to
the dentist.

842
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,500
I just brush and floss.
- What?

843
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,133
- But you just take 'em out and
put 'em in a glass at night,

844
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,900
right?

845
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,333
- The biggest career move I ever
did was

846
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,333
to have my teeth removed.
- Exactly.

847
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,800
- Choking on chicken in an
exercise video is not good.

848
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,333
- It's not cute.
It's not cute for her.

849
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,567
- But choking on chicken in
private or choking your chicken.

850
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,967
- Choking anybody's chicken is
not cute

851
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,300
if it's on camera.

852
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
- I think your dress goes with
the whole India theme.

853
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,867
Sari.

854
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:24,066
- Sorry seems to be the
hardest...dress to wear.

855
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,567
- Yeah.
It is, it is.

856
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,266
- Smizing got out of control.

857
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:31,100
The smizing was--it's like gonna
be the next version of<i> Saw.</i>

858
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,233
Like,<i> Saw 10: The Smize.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Smize 5.

859
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,834
- Oh, I'm gettin' daggers!

860
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,934
I'm gonna cut you and she's
gonna cut me.

861
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:40,300
It's gonna be a bitch fight!

862
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,367
- You know, there's something

863
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,567
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> that</i>

864
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,166
frees up our judges to let it
all hang out.

865
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,300
Maybe a little too far out.

866
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,133
- If you haven't noticed, I'm
like a bald-headed ho.

867
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't have any hair at all.

868
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,500
- That's the cake I would've
wanted

869
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,834
when I was like eight and having
my princess birthday party,

870
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,500
so I guess when I was eight, I
wanted a gay wedding cake.

871
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,800
Which makes sense.

872
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,867
- I want that shrug so bad.

873
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:06,800
- This one?

874
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,333
- I want to roll around in it.

875
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,400
I want to see it first thing in
the morning.

876
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,700
I want to nuzzle it.

877
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,867
- The thing that I didn't like

878
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,433
was, like, I felt like she had a

879
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,500
bouquet of flowers in her hair.

880
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,300
- What's wrong with flowers in
her hair?

881
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,900
- And it was really distracting.
- Will you look at Ru?

882
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,734
- Yeah, I've got a bouquet of
flowers here.

883
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,100
- Ru's got a damn florist,
not a bouquet.

884
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,233
- I got a lot going on.

885
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,300
- You're more fresh than a
hibiscus bush.

886
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,567
- I got some birds.
I had some snakes.

887
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,367
- I'm gonna have an apple in a
minute.

888
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,367
[laughter]

889
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:40,066
- Did you bake that cake in your
lovin' oven?

890
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,133
- What? I'm sorry?

891
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,867
[laughter]

892
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,400
Never mind.

893
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,066
Judges, you have not been a help
at all.

894
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,233
- Sorry.

895
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,767
- Two-time guest judge, the

896
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,567
luminous La Toya Jackson, has a

897
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:57,333
giggle that is both magical and
infectious.

898
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:02,066
Before long, she had everybody
doing the toy-toy titter.

899
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,133
Hee hee hee hee!

900
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,100
- [giggling]

901
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,734
[laughter]

902
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:10,166
[giggling]
Am I wrong for saying that?

903
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,633
- How about that La Toya
Jackson?

904
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,400
- Hee hee hee hee hee!

905
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,567
- Are you recording this?

906
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,900
[giggling]

907
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,667
[all mocking La Toya's laugh]

908
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,166
- I'm drinking champagne!

909
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,467
Hee hee hee hee!
- [giggles]

910
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,266
Stop it.

911
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:27,266
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

912
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:30,133
<i>Now, there's more to drag</i>
<i>queens than meets the eye.</i>

913
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:34,867
<i>Beneath all the padding,</i>
<i>glitter, and false eyelashes,</i>

914
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:37,200
lady boys need love too.

915
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,133
- I've had a boyfriend
for ten years.

916
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,967
- I want to be with my husband
for ten years.

917
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,367
It's been more than three years.

918
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,100
- The thing about a
relationship, and plus, you're

919
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,834
a drag queen; I mean, you gotta
just be ready for anything,

920
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,266
you know?
- Well, the thing is that he

921
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,266
gets a two-for-one with Carmen,
you know what I mean, so...

922
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:52,166
there's no complaints.

923
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,600
- Are you missing your husband
at all?

924
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,767
- Yes, I miss him, girl.
- Are you?

925
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,333
- And I know he's missing me.

926
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,333
Like, I guess that's the hardest

927
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,700
part of--that I know, like, what

928
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,900
he's going through.
You know, he loves me to death.

929
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,600
He would do anything for me.
He goes to all my shows.

930
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,467
Helps me, dresses me.
- Oh, how cool.

931
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,567
- It's so difficult for us in

932
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,133
this business to actually meet
somebody.

933
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,700
- Oh, yes.

934
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,133
- That's why you have to date
another drag queen.

935
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,500
- Yes!

936
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,133
- It's nice, because, like, you
understand each other.

937
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,734
And you double your wardrobe.

938
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,066
[laughter]

939
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:21,400
- When it comes to seeing their

940
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,066
son in high heels and a dress,

941
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:26,467
some parents just don't
understand.

942
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:32,300
But our brave and talented
queens have learned to carry on.

943
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,266
- Yara, has your family ever
come to see you perform?

944
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:39,967
- My mother, the thing she
doesn't get it is she thinks

945
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:41,867
that I'm a stripper.

946
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:43,934
- Well, you kind of are.
- She doesn't get that

947
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:47,433
we lip-sync and we do
[indistinct],

948
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:48,867
you know what I mean?

949
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:51,333
She doesn't get it.
- I think Yara's a stripper.

950
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,400
[laughs]

951
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
- Hey, Shangela, has your

952
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,133
grandmother ever seen you
perform?

953
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,734
- She loved it, she was like,

954
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,767
"I couldn't believe it.
You look like a woman.

955
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:00,834
I said, 'That's not DJ.

956
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,133
That's a white woman.'"

957
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,066
- Home is where the love is.

958
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,333
And some of our queens have

959
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,333
created new families, with drag

960
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,066
mothers and drag sisters that

961
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:15,133
make the world a more fabulous
place to live.

962
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,400
- You guys have houses.

963
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,800
- Mm-hmm, houses.

964
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
- What does that mean?

965
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,600
Like a family?

966
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,467
- It's kind of like

967
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:21,934
fraternities and sororities.

968
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,333
But with gay culture.

969
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,300
Most of our house names are
after designers.

970
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,767
- Okay.

971
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,066
- So it's like you have the
house of Balenciaga, the house

972
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:32,166
of Chanel, the house of...
so many others.

973
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,266
- What house are you in?
- Balenciaga.

974
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:37,567
- The Balenciaga.
- Balenciaga. Okay.

975
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,266
- I miss my drag family.
I mean, I see my family...

976
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,100
I call them my family 'cause
they really are my drag family.

977
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,400
But more than that, they're my
friends.

978
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,433
And I see them and talk to them
every day, all day long.

979
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,700
Even if we're not working.
- Exactly.

980
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,600
So really just family.
- Let's do this; let's do that.

981
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,767
- Before I did drag, I used to
go watch Raja's shows.

982
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,967
So she's like my unofficial
drag mother.

983
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:03,133
- Okay.

984
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,066
- Amen and hallelu.

985
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:07,333
Now, coming out is different for
everybody.

986
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,567
Some queens don't put it
together until later in life.

987
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:15,333
And others, well...they just
seem to be born that way.

988
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,266
- When I came out of the womb,
I came out.

989
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:21,200
So it was just a matter of my
parents having to learn

990
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,233
and deal with it, you know?

991
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:26,867
- I grew up in a very ignorant
place.

992
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,700
We got, like, one gay kid a
year.

993
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
- Were you that one gay kid in
your class?

994
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,266
- I was the one gay kid that
everyone probably suspected.

995
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,066
I can remember, like, in
kindergarten, I was in catholic

996
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:38,233
school...and I would just like
go up to boys and kiss them.

997
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:39,667
- Believe me, if we were in
kindergarten together, I would

998
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,700
let you kiss me.
- [laughs]

999
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,133
- So, miss Phoenix, girl, we
both are from Georgia.

1000
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,533
Was it as unpleasant for you as
it was for me?

1001
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,467
- I remember, like, in high
school, somebody getting pegged

1002
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:53,600
in the head with a Coke can,
'cause he was gay.

1003
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,967
- Girl, shut up.
- And...

1004
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,800
- They, ooh, they were--

1005
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,500
- Yeah, I was like, "absolutely
not."

1006
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,333
I'm like, "whatever is going on
with me..."

1007
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,433
- Is gonna be with me.
- It's gonna be with me.

1008
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:04,200
I'm not telling another
motherfucker.

1009
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,433
One of my best friends, he kind
of like helped me come out, and

1010
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,900
he actually is the one that
helped me get started in drag,

1011
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,600
so...
- Oh, word.

1012
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,333
- Yeah, I mean, he, like, kind
of showed me there is, like,

1013
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,233
another world out there.
- Thank god.

1014
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,767
- I'd take my friends to lunch
and be like, "um, okay.

1015
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:23,500
So I have something to tell you.
And, as you know, I've gone on

1016
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:29,333
dates with girls, but also I
have gone on dates with guys."

1017
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,667
And then I'd just pause and wait
for the reaction.

1018
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,934
And every time, everyone went,
"oh, I knew."

1019
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:37,100
And I was like, "oh."

1020
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,800
- I didn't come out.
My mom caught me.

1021
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,367
- What do you mean she caught
you?

1022
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,734
- Wait, wait, wait.
Your mom caught you doing what?

1023
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:48,500
- I called my neighbor, and I
was doing my thing, and then my

1024
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,367
mom opened the door, heh.
And I was there...

1025
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,633
- Alexis, what's your coming out
story?

1026
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,066
- It was horrible.
- How?

1027
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:00,934
- I decided to have an
experience with a man.

1028
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,867
He used to pick me up at school.

1029
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,433
I got really scared, 'cause

1030
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,233
everybody started saying that I
was gay and all this bullshit.

1031
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,500
So I cut off relationship
thingy,

1032
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,333
and he wrote a letter to my mom.

1033
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,633
- [gasps]

1034
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,066
- I walk in my house, and my

1035
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:16,467
mom was sitting at the table,

1036
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,066
and she said to me, "put your
backpack in your room.

1037
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:23,200
I need to talk to you."
The jig was up.

1038
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,367
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

1039
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:33,166
In just one week, one of these
queens--Manila Luzon, Raja, or

1040
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:38,667
Alexis Mateo--will be crowned
America's next drag superstar

1041
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,266
and walk away with a lifetime
supply

1042
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:44,066
<i>of Kryolan professional</i>
<i>makeup...</i>

1043
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,300
<i>headline logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>

1045

<i>and win a cash prize of 75,000.</i>

1046
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,066
Let's take a look back at the
special blend of charisma,

1047
00:38:57,066 --> 00:39:02,266
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
that make these three queens the

1048
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:05,066
cream of the crop.

1049
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,967
Manila Luzon had a unique
insight coming

1050
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,533
into this competition.

1051
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,233
- My drag persona Manila is my

1052
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:15,400
personal muse, because I inspire
myself.

1053
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,233
During the day as a boy, I'm a
graphic designer.

1054
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:23,834
And my job does affect my drag
because it really helps me put

1055
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:26,133
together a visual story that I

1056
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,467
want to communicate to the
audience.

1057
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:32,867
- Her comedic abilities made
the judges laugh in challenge

1058
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:34,600
after challenge after challenge.

1059
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,633
- Manila, you're all ears, girl.

1060
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:40,066
[laughter]

1061
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,667
- Manila proved that there's

1062
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,700
more to her than just comedy.

1063
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,467
She brought originality and
served up high glamour.

1064
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:51,700
<i>- Drag, to me, is creatively</i>
<i>bringing together an entire</i>

1065
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,367
<i>story and costumes and</i>
<i>character</i>

1066
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,633
and putting them
into one living being.

1067
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:58,533
That's the best part.

1068
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:01,500
<i>- A world-class queen</i>
<i>with beauty, brains,</i>

1069
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>and a bright persona,</i>

1070
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,667
Manila just might have what it
takes to be

1071
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:09,033
America's next drag superstar.

1072
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,934
Christmas came early for
Southern California native Raja,

1073
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:16,033
winning both challenges her
first week here.

1074
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:19,433
- Oh, no stranger to the runway.

1075
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:20,667
<i>- I've always been a drag</i>
<i>queen.</i>

1076
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,800
<i>To me, it's just like</i>
<i>breathing.</i>

1077
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,133
<i>I've always loved fashion and I</i>

1078
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,734

1079
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:27,934
<i>that only women are allowed to</i>

1080
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,834
<i>wear beautiful, fashionable</i>
<i>things.</i>

1081
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:32,934
<i>- Her high fashion</i>
<i>sensibilities, unexpected</i>

1082
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:35,600
<i>choices, and incredible makeup</i>

1083
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,233
<i>artistry kept Raja at the top</i>
<i>of the class.</i>

1084
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,700
<i>- I love iconic people</i>
<i>within fashion.</i>

1085
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,500
<i>A little coo coo, a little</i>
<i>berserk, a little funny,</i>

1086
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,400
<i>a little eccentric--that's my</i>
<i>style; that's my fashion</i>

1087

reference that I look to.

1088
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,333
I don't care to look like
a Kardashian.

1089
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,166
<i>Raja is cultural.</i>
<i>She's smart.</i>

1090
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,834
<i>She's adventurous.</i>

1091
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:00,567
<i>She definitely thinks</i>
<i>outside of the box.</i>

1092
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,633
And she's genderless.

1093
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,767
She's raceless
and she's ageless.

1094
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,800
- Raja isn't just fierce.

1095
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,900
She proved that she's versatile,
intelligent,

1096
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,233
and isn't afraid to act the
fool.

1097
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:15,367
- No one can hear your
lip-synching in space.

1098
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,300
Prepare to die!

1099
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,533
<i>- Raja is definitely at the top</i>
<i>of her game.</i>

1100
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:25,166
<i>But will her many talents take</i>
<i>her to the top of the heap?</i>

1101
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:29,433
Straight out of central Florida
comes Alexis Mateo.

1102
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,867
Bam.

1103
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,967
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Elizabeth

1104
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:35,300
<i>y todos los demas.</i>

1105

<i>♪ Ooh ooh ♪</i>

1107
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,066
Bam! Bam!

1108
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,467
- Cha-cha.

1109
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:44,266
<i>- A Puerto Rican pageant queen</i>
<i>whose beauty and positive</i>

1110
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:46,767
<i>attitude are captivating.</i>

1111
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:48,633
<i>- I grew up doing pageants.</i>

1112
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:51,133
And it's always about how
flawless

1113
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,567
and how perfect you are.

1114
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:56,367
So I guess, in the back of my
mind, I'm always trying to be

1115
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,533
completely pageant-ready.

1116
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,300
- Behind her big smile,

1117
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,300
we learned a story of pain
and loss.

1118
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,800
Do you know anybody
in the military?

1119
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,834
- [sighs]

1120
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:10,533
Three years ago, I met somebody
very special in my life.

1121
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:13,066
We get our relationship very
secretly.

1122
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:15,867
And, like, the best moments of
my life was with him.

1123
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,834
And he got called to go to
service,

1124
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,367
and I don't know nothing
about him

1125
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,233
since like a year and a half.

1126
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:26,266
So I really don't know
if he's okay.

1127
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:30,600
- What would you say to him
right now?

1128
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,066
- I want to say I'm sorry and
that I love him so much

1129
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:35,266
and that I am very proud of him.

1130
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:39,834
- Alexis Mateo, you turned
sadness into gladness

1131
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,633
and made us proud.

1132
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:46,200
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.

1133
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,433
- Thank you.

1134
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:50,600
- Is there anything
you'd like to say?

1135
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,800
- I know some things
happen in life.

1136
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,233
It teaches you a lot of valuable
lessons.

1137
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:58,667
And this one helped me to grow,

1138
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:01,667
'cause I normally depend a lot
from people.

1139
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:05,333
And I want to say thank you to
that special person that showed

1140
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:13,500
me that I needed to love myself
first.

1141
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,734
<i>The best part of being a drag</i>

Bam!

00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,066
- Alexis proves the winning
power of perseverance.

1149
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:40,600
And that is a quality of
a champion, honey.

1150
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,300
So there you have it.
Are you team Manila?

1151
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,900
Team Raja?
Or team Alexis?

1152
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,433
All three are fierce
competitors.

1153
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,567
But only one can be
the champion.

1154
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:57,066

America's next drag superstar

<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

1156
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:02,934
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1157
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,967
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1158
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:08,200
Can I get a amen in here?

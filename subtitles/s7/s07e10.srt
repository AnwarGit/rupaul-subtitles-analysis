It was hard to jump in with my lines

Ginger Minj.

9
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,298
Your performance as Edie
was a masterpiece.

-You're the winner of this challenge.
-Thanks.

-I didn't realize you're the good Divine.

[RuPaul] Miss Fame.

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:44,344
As an actress, you don't have to say:
"Look at me, I'm bad." [growls]

14
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,212
It should come naturally.

15
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,650
Who deserves to go home tonight and why?

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,085
-[RuPaul] Fame.
-[Pearl] Fame.

-[Ginger] Fame.
-Fame.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,757
Trixie got to come back so she should be
looked at with a magnifying lens.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,795
There's a part of Pearl
that's too cool for season seven,

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,329
and she knows what I mean.

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,731
I don't know what she means.

22
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,934
I don't think I'm too cool
for season seven at all.

23
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,005
Pearl, shantay, you stay.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,175
Miss Fame, sashay away.

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,118
{\an8}[laughter]

26
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,254
{\an8}Back in the workroom after elimination,
Fame's gone home.

27
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,459
{\an8}"Continue to inspire. You're incredible.
I love you. Fame."

28
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,427
{\an8}Oh, I'm gonna miss her so much.

29
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,831
{\an8}With that being said,
take that shit off the mirror.

30
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,799
{\an8}[laughter]

31
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:44,304
{\an8}Fame probably felt really attacked,
because she was nice to everyone.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,507
{\an8}Everyone is throwing her under the bus.
It sucks.

33
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,778
{\an8}Fame was really trying.
There are less deserving queens here.

34
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,884
-So congratulations, winner.
-Thank you.

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,988
Of all challenges to win,
that's fucking awesome.

36
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,525
[Ginger] Girl, how about Fame
throwing you under the bus?

37
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,627
I didn't expect that at all.

38
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:12,432
{\an8}"Pearl knows what I'm talking about."
It's like: "No, I don't."

39
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,636
But her calling me out
gave me an extra kick in the ass

40
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,872
to floor the bitch in the lip-sync.

41
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,040
It was really, like, such a close call.

42
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,710
I really could have been lip-syncing.

43
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,479
{\an8}Violet should be very, very grateful

44
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}that her Lisa Frank couture kept her from
 being in the bottom two this week,

45
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,621
because her performance was abysmal.

46
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,691
Even if it kills me, I'll fucking come out
on top the next challenge.

47
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,395
{\an8}Violet's strengths are her runway
but at this point in the competition

48
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,565
you have to be versatile.
If you only have one strength...

49
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,535
...you're fucked.

in the club are two different things.

162
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,875
I hope her personality shines through
and she just plays it out.

163
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,914
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi!

164
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,517
-Trixie, back together again!
-Ginger and Trixie, the sequel.

165
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,020
-I like to call it "the revenge".
-Oh!

166
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:25,124
What's the hardest part of this challenge?
What are you not looking forward to?

167
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,726
-We'll do it live.
-Mm-hmm.

168
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,497
So I think the pressure of that,
with me not being a dancer,

169
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,800
that's the one part
that keeps playing over in my head.

170
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,136
Yeah. What are you most worried about?

171
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,306
I hate to say
I got outshined by Ginger last week.

172
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,708
I'm not trying to have it happen again.

173
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,077
Okay.

174
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,947
-All right, well, get back to work.
-Thank you.

175
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,351
-Hey, ladies!
-Hi, Ru!

176
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,656
-Now, Violet, do you dance at all?
-I actually... I'm an aerial performer.

177
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:02,962
If I recall right, in the last challenge,
you had problems with rhythm and timing.

178
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,831
-I did.
-How will you work through that?

179
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,100
Own it, work through it.
I'll turn it out.

180
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,603
Those are famous last words around here.

181
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,305
I already said 'em once, I'm still here.

182
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,808
Yeah? Well, okay. All right.

183
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,346
{\an8}Violet is sexy as hell,
but she has to bring something else.

184
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,283
[RuPaul] Ladies, gather round!

185
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,455
Soon you'll rehearse with Kym Johnson
from <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.

186
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,657
And...

187
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,927
our very own Carson Kressley.

188
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,763
So, ladies, good luck and...

189
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,534
five, six, seven, eight,
don't fuck it up.

190
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,203
All right!

191
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,476
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha,
cha-cha-cha, to me.

192
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,044
And...

193
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,814
-And good, we have visitors.
-Oh, hello!

194
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,015
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!

195
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,853
{\an8}So today I brought my really fantastic,
amazingly talented friend Kym Johnson.

196
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,291
{\an8}She taught me on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.
She's brought great assistants today.

197
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:09,595
-You're doing the Charleston Twerk?
-Yes.

198
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,298
-Then let's get started with the routine.
-Let's do it.

199
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,669
And so with tricks and stuff,
can you do the splits?

200
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,505
-I can split, flip.
-Can I see it?

201
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,674
-[Pearl] Oh, my God!
-[Kym] Give it to me.

202
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,411
Whoo! Oh! Amazing!

203
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,947
-Yes, Kennedy.
-[Kym] Oh, my goodness!

204
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,682
-You can't do that?
-No.

205
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,817
I'm not gonna dwell on the fact that

206
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,422
{\an8}Kennedy does a back handspring double axel
with a twist landing into a split

207
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,559
and I can't. I'll give them the energy
they've been asking for over and over.

208
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,000
-Grab ahold of his waist.
-Like this?

209
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,772
-Child's play!
-Walk it through.

210
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,374
-Try to keep your core really tight.
-[Pearl] Okay.

211
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,942
[Kym] In.

212
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,979
-[Carson] Pearl...
-[Kym] Yes.

213
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,616
-[Carson] <i>A little gangly.</i>
-Yes, she has to straighten those legs.

214
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,952
Her legs bent up in the air like that,
they weren't so attractive.

215
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,021
-Good luck with that.
-Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,757
-Pearl, have you twerked before?
-Never. [laughs]

217
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,294
-Never?
-If you can't twerk, shake your legs.

218
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,830
-Yeah.
-Like this?

219
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,567
Can we bring Ambrose out to show him?

220
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,104
-You wanna go hop, hop.
-See how cool that looks?

221
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,640
-No problem.
-Can you do that?

222
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,309
-Pop, pop, pop, pop.
-[Kym laughs]

223
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,078
Yeah, no, not so much.

224
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,918
As far as the choreography,
it's the technique that's lacking, so...

225
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,719
We got work to do, Miss Pearl.

226
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,125
-Hi!
-Hello!

227
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,027
{\an8}I feel really good going in with Katya.

228
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,630
We have a good grasp on the vibe
and the style so we're gonna work it out.

229
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,969
I'm going to need Ambrose to come in here.
He's the voguing expert.

230
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,840
One, two, three, four.
Open it up on five, six.

231
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,676
Touch your cheekbone, seven, eight.
Sharp to the front on one.

232
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,548
Three, four, five, six, and Madonna.

233
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,083
Seven, eight, one.

234
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,153
-Totally!
-[Katya laughs]

235
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,056
-[Kym] I know it seems simple but--
-No, we know it's not.

236
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,624
[Kym] Oh. [laughs]

237
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,728
We start the choreography and immediately,
I'm totally freaked out.

238
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,697
Okay, fuck! No, sorry.

239
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,298
-Yeah? Good?
-It's just...

240
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,534
It's a lot. It seems really complicated.

241
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,436
-Lunge, dip.
-Oh, shit, fuck.

242
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,171
-[Katya] Sorry.
-[Kym] No.

243
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:36,976
With choreography, I can get it,
if I have about three to four months.

244
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,714
So then we're gonna walk.
One, two, and flick. Good.

245
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,049
-[Katya] Okay.
-[Kym] Want to try together?

246
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,453
One, two, up and down.
So like you're hopping over something.

247
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,588
Ooh! Ooh!

248
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,857
Just hop over.

249
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,327
You'll get it. Left, flick.

250
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,596
But then... almost-ish.

251
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,566
Keep breathing, keep trying.
You're gonna get this.

252
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,302
Violet cannot get this goddamn leg flick.

253
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,872
It's just flick your fucking legs,
try to kick your butt, do-- [groans]

254
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,007
It's very frustrating.

255
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,910
-[Kym] Fast, fast, turn! Get down.
-[Carson] Yes!

256
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,945
-Come up. Come up!
-[Violet cries]

257
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,981
Face, face, face! Turn!

258
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,284
Up! Yep.

259
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,020
[Kym] Madonna, walk, walk!

260
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,723
Katya, is that terror or confusion
on your face?

261
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,058
It's a little bit of both.

262
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,860
It was just pandemonium.

263
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,665
This could really be a disaster,
or it could be absolutely incredible.

264
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,334
-[Carson] We have a medic. They'll be OK.
-[Kym laughs]

265
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,003
-You'll have your work cut out for you.
-Yeah, no shit.

266
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,006
-Hi.
-Hello!

267
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,210
{\an8}Our mash-up is country robot,
which is perfect

268
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,080
because this is like a kind of funny,
campy piece.

269
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,416
-So are you guys good dancers?
-No.

270
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,518
-I'm not.
-You look like you're worried.

271
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,253
Lord be with me!

272
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,323
You're gonna go bah, bah.
Keep your head to the front.

273
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,092
-Now, your head goes last.
-Oh, okay.

274
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,094
-Yes!
-[Kym] Yeah, how did that feel?

275
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,395
Terrible.

276
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:08,600
In the country we don't move like this.
We move nice and slow and fluid.

277
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,502
Slow being the key word.

278
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:15,107
And up, there, out, up. Feet together.

279
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,544
-[Kym] Almost. We'll get that.
-[Ginger] Hey, girl!

280
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,112
Ginger.

281
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,614
-How's it going?
-I'm okay.

282
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,984
-Yeah?
-I'm not in meltdown mode yet.

283
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,618
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

284
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,390
Let's try the country two-step.
One, two, three. One, two, three. Flick.

285
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,227
-Right, left, right, right, left, right.
-Good!

286
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,229
-Very nice.
-Very nice, then...

287
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,131
You're gonna jump off.

288
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,933
Oh, God!

289
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,804
-Put your left arm around her shoulder.
-[Ginger] Don't lean back.

290
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,439
[Trixie] I do yoga, I got it.

291
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,475
-I do frozen yogurt.
-[Kym laughs]

292
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,245
I look at Trixie like:
"I hope you've been working out, girl.

293
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,614
I'm a delicate flower. You're lifting me."

294
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,249
[Ginger] All right.

295
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,119
[Kym] One... oh, oh, oh!
No, no, no. Sorry.

296
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,954
Maybe a little more graceful.

297
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,125
-One, two, three--
-Ooh! I'm sorry.

298
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,028
-Ginger, is your insurance up to date?
-[laughter]

299
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,130
-Thanks, Obama.
-I won't drop her.

300
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,601
This is a chance for the judges to go:
"Trixie lifted Ginger. It was awesome."

301
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,970
So we jump one...

302
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,040
No matter what I do, I won't drop Ginger.

303
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,975
-[Kym] Oh, and arms...
-[Ginger] Aah!

304
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,377
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Are you OK?

305
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,212
And then I dropped Ginger.

306
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,848
-Just rehearse like crazy.
-[Kym] Yeah.

307
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,650
We will, absolutely.

308
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,891
{\an8}[Pearl] Oh, just another day
in the workroom, girl.

309
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,495
{\an8}For this challenge, we have to dance
in pairs dressed as half man, half woman.

310
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:48,067
With only six of us, it's a one
in three chance you'll lip-sync.

311
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,469
So it's a different air in the room today.

312
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,938
-I did not sleep at all last night.
-Really?

313
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,675
No. I was literally up all night
doing the robot.

314
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,378
I have no clue what I'm doing, girl.

315
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,347
I'm like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

316
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,619
Yeah. I'm not a dancer either.
It's all about selling it.

317
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,255
It'll be who performs their song best.

318
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm just afraid I'm gonna look like

319
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,695
Honey Boo Boo meets Rosie O'Donnell.

320
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,266

was a little laid-back.

478
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,729
-I felt that it looked effortless.
-Thank you.

479
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:29,100
I love the wheelbarrow move.
That's how I got pregnant.

480
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,436
I had a great time watching.

481
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,839
-Next up, Trixie Mattel.
-Howdy, y'all.

482
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,577
Trixie, I think you definitely nailed
the runway look

483
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:44,015
and you kept true to Trixie with that
dangling bottom eyelash, so...

484
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,752
-It's a bit campy. Obviously.
[Trixie] -Yeah.

485
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,654
-Just a bit.
-Just a little.

486
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,623
Your dancing was technically strong.

487
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,225
Maybe not so much robot,
but you nailed the country.

488
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,661
Next up, Ginger Minj.

489
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:01,966
I loved the attempt to butch up
when you showed the guy side.

490
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,236
-I coached her. I coached her.
-And it shows.

491
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,773
The dancing this week,
it seemed off for you.

492
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,177
Not that you were bad, 'cause you weren't.

493
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,978
Um...

494
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,447
This was so hard for me.

495
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:23,488
I was at my full mental capacity
because it was so out of my comfort zone.

496
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,759
-Where are the emotions coming from?
-My biggest fear is dancing in public.

497
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,762
Because I feel people are going
to judge me poorly

498
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,797
for how I look and the way things jiggle.

499
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,267
I didn't know any of your insecurities
and you could not tell.

500
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,070
-You were absolutely magnificent.
-I second that.

501
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:44,342
We just see this beautiful,
talented person that's having a good time.

502
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,711
All right, thank you.

503
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,151
-Next up, Katya.
-I loved seeing you with this black hair.

504
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,020
We're used to seeing Katya
in red hair and blond hair.

505
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,356
We haven't gotten the black fantasy yet.

506
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,526
-Ooh, girl.
-Well, I've had it many a time,

507
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,096
-but not from you, Katya.
-When I saw you come out on the runway,

508
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,532
I was like: "Oh!" You were coquettish.

509
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,202
And then when you turned,
and I mean this as a compliment,

510
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,773
it was very, like, hot, douchey guy.

511
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,177
-That is amazing.
-All right, "V" is for Violet.

512
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,347
-You were an absolute work of art.
-Thank you.

513
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,718
You are so exquisite.
Like, I kind of want to be you.

514
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,453
-Am I weird?
-Have your baby first.

515
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,056
-Maybe I'm gonna name my baby after you.
-RuPaula Chachki.

516
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,459
[Alyssa] There you go, perfect.

517
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,263
Technically, your tango,
you had just the right tone for it.

518
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:43,034
On some extensions, you got really low.
It was very tango, congratulations.

519
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,469
Thank you.

520
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:51,175
Thank you. While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

521
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,446
Now, just between us dance moms.

522
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,548
What the hell are we gonna do?

523
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:02,086
They were all good,
but we must choose the best and the worst.

524
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,123
We're gonna start with Pearl.

525
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:09,394
Of all of them,
Pearl made the hottest guy.

526
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,964
And she exuded confidence.
We usually see a zombie.

527
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:17,268
She's crossed over this line now
and she's really in the game.

528
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,271
I love that aloof attitude that she had.

529
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,839
Very "flazay da".

530
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,709
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>

531
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,779
-Did you get a look at her ass?
-[Michelle] Oh, yeah!

532
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,515
Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake.

533
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:35,820
Kennedy was shining tonight.
She clearly was the strength in the duo.

534
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:40,692
The dancing was the con.
I know you guys think it was very strong.

535
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,994
There wasn't enough razzle-dazzle for me.

536
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,763
-But I liked that it looked effortless.
-Really?

537
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,932
-She was on fire!
-She looked bored.

538
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:53,104
She was a great twerker,
but there wasn't much energy in her dance.

539
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,641
-[RuPaul] <i>Trixie Mattel.</i>
-I might be alone in this one

540
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,577
but I had a really good time with Trixie.

541
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,714
I don't have the same enthusiasm
that Michelle has for Trixie.

542
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,984
For me, honestly,
it just left me a little like "meh."

543
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,889
I didn't see that glint in her eye
of, like, "I really want this".

544
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,193
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-I think her look on the runway was okay.

545
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,897
-[Michelle] <i>The girl half wasn't exciting.</i>
-Let's discuss them as a pair.

546
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,501
I know you're in a difficult position
and you're splitting hairs, but...

547
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:27,972
watching that performance, it felt jokey.
It just wasn't my cup of tea.

548
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,942
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-She looked gorgeous on the runway

549
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,879
but her boy side was just kind of "meh."

550
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,383
-Blah.
-Katya's choreography was very correct.

551
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,586
When I said that she was hot,
douchey as the male,

552
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:46,591
it impressed me
that she was able to go that masculine.

553
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,194
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
-Tonight, her runway was the best for me.

554
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,597
-What artistry!
-[RuPaul] <i>It took my breath away.</i>

555
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,532
-[Michelle] <i>Yes.</i>
-She's a little bit like Bambi.

556
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,835
Very pretty, big eyes,
but when you ask her to move, it's like--

557
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,837
-Like Taylor Swift in heels.
-Yes.

558
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,639
But the tango's not an easy dance.

559
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,376
So for her to pull off what she did,
I think she did a great job.

560
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,613
Silence! I've made my decision.

561
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,314
I think.

562
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,317
Bring back my girls.

563
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,886
Welcome back, ladies.

564
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:21,292
Based on your prancing and runways,
I've made some decisions.

565
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,430
And this week, I'm judging you in pairs.

566
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:31,402
Pearl and Kennedy Davenport,
we flipped for your flappers.

567
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,406
But were you one step
behind the competition?

568
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,480
Trixie Mattel and Ginger Minj
took us for a roll in the hey, girl, hey.

569
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,449
But was it a barn burner?

570
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:50,621
Katya and Violet Chachki.
You two make a striking pair.

571
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,124
But could this be your last tango?

572
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,896
Katya and Violet.

573
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,967
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.

574
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,505
I'm so fucking happy! You fucking bitch!

575
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:09,974
Sorry. I'm sorry.

576
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,580
[RuPaul] You've each won an original gown
from Mountbatten Concepts

577
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,852
and a gift card from Klein Epstein Parker,
made-to-measure suits.

578
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,056
You may step to the back of the stage.

579
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,825
{\an8}Katya and I won, and I cannot believe it.

580
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,727
Actually, yeah, I can.

581
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,165
Pearl and Kennedy...

582
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,970
You're safe.

583
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,709
You may join the other girls.

584
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:55,286
Trixie and Ginger, I'm sorry,
my dears, but you are up for elimination.

585
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,856
{\an8}It is breaking my heart,
having to go against Trixie.

586
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:03,661
But as much as I love her,
I am here to win.

587
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,364
Two queens stand before me.

588
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,502
Ladies,
this is your last chance to impress me

589
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,206
and save yourself from elimination.

590
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,477
The time has come...

591
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,579

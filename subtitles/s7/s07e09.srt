Ever since we started this challenge,

I've been in my head.

Ginger, you're better than this.

22

I'm gonna kill the next challenge.

-Thanks, Pearl, for helping me get back.
-[Violet] Why did you bring that tramp?

28

I can feel the sisterhood.

29
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:50,276
{\an8}Should have been the top six,
but we have a top seven, thanks to Trixie.

-It's a war, bitch.

I'm pissed off, to be honest with you
and this is not a read on you

with a dress I just picked,

for not trying hard enough.

Last week, you were criticized
for bringing too much pageantry,

199
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:36,362
so this challenge
could force you out of your comfort zone.

200

{\an8}This is another opportunity

-Mm-hmm.

204
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,378
{\an8}When I was younger,
I convinced my grandmother

205
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,582
that <i>Pink Flamingos</i> was for children,
and I wanted to be Divine.

206
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,517
That was a changing point in my life.

How did you choose your ugliest dress?
I mean, did you just go...

I already lip synced once,
I don't want to do it again.

307
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,558

Bitch, you're very blessed, your talents
have taken you far, and I'm struggling.

315
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,284
[Pearl] It's okay,
your insecurities can take you there.

316
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,121
And your lack of will to be here
has really gotten you far.

317
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,357
{\an8}When it comes to Fame,
anyone could read her,

318

some weird underlying tension.

What's been your big struggle with drag?

323
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,480
Well, my whole career has been a struggle.

324
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,749
[Kennedy]
It's my primary source of income.

325
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,621
The bookings are very scarce.
Drag, it barely paid the bills.

326
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,658
I have no retirement. I have nothing.

327
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,428
It's just a lot of sacrifices being made

328
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:54,500
because you wanted to pursue
your dream as an entertainer.

329
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,337
{\an8}A full time job
as a female impersonator is not easy,

330
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,606
<i>especially when you have bills to pay.</i>

331
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,910
But I stuck with drag
because entertaining is my passion.

332
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,481
It's the life of a working artist.
It's hard, but satisfying and exciting.

333
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,486
I cannot believe
John Waters is gonna be here.

334
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,123
Him and Divine are such legends.
It's crazy.

335
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,126
When I started doing drag,
I started seeing those movies,

336
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:25,597
and it made me feel like it was okay
to be as un-beautiful as I wanted to be.

337
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,067
I always liked to be shocking and funny
before I be pretty.

-I'm so glad that's over.

488
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,429
I'm starving.
You got anything good around here to eat?

489
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,603
-Absolutely filthy.
-[laughter]

490
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,641
All right, my Divine dolls,
time for the judges' critiques.

491
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,011
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.

492
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:37,515
I don't think your look is ugly enough.
It's kind of old lady chic.

493
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:41,352
As Dawn Davenport,
you lived up to your name perfectly.

494
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,689
The rage was there.
It was very much a tribute to me.

495
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,725
-I was flattered.
-It's an honor.

496
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,160
You know, Kennedy,
it wasn't until just now

497
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:54,632
I realized you played Dawn Davenport,
and you are Kennedy Davenport.

498
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,668
-[boing]
-Welcome.

499
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,336
[laughter]

500
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,138
Next up, Katya.

501
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,976
You went beyond playing the straight
mother and added a new layer of filth.

502
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,613
You did a beautiful obscenity,
so I wanted to congratulate you.

503
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,352
As for this outfit... ugh, those colors.
They just... give me life.

504
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,323
It's all really ugly. Well done.

505
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:23,194
But I think the hippest girl in Brooklyn
would love that dress and wear it today.

506
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,697
All right, next up, Ginger Minj.

507
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,133
[Michelle]
Tonight, the color is horrendous.

508
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:32,604
Your performance as Edie
was a masterpiece.

509
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,807
[John] There was moments
when it looked exactly like her.

510
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,444
-She had some loveliness that you played.
-Thank you.

511
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,945
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.

512
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,983
To me, it's not terribly ugly.
There's leopard print in there, so--bing!

513
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:51,022
I think I might have actually worn this.
It's from the Gunny Sacks catalogue, 1986.

514
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,958
You know, in this scene in the movie,
Divine isn't angry,

515
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,294
so I thought there was a moment of pathos.

516
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,363
-You did that well.
-Thank you.

517
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,966
But I do feel
like Ginger outshined you a little bit.

518
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,169
[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.

519
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,172
Your dress
is the least ugliest out of everyone's.

520
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,207
I'm not gonna lie. I feel cute.

521
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,543
With your performance,
you knew your lines.

522
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,479
A bit hesitant.
We're getting down to the wire here.

523
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,081
-Yeah.
-So you need to go forth at this point.

524
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,186
Yes. I didn't even understand
you were supposed to be the good Divine.

525
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,855
[RuPaul] Next up, Violet Chachki.

526
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,058
On your runway look,
more than anybody on this stage,

527
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,261
you nailed this challenge
because you're giving us ugly.

528
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,697
-It's a talent.
-Your performance as Divine.

529
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,567
Out of the group,
you looked the most authentic.

530
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:40,305
But I didn't quite understand the padding.
If you were gonna go full Divine, do it.

531
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,675
I thought the performance
was a little bit flat for me,

532
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,745
just because it didn't seem to me
you had your confidence with the material.

533
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,815
[RuPaul] Up next, Miss Fame.

534
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,518
Miss Fame, you need ugly lessons.

535
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,688
Because that dress, to me,
is incredibly elegant.

536
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,123
The performance wasn't my favorite.

537
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,726
It was put on so much.

538
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,762
As an actress, you don't have to say,
"Look at me, I'm bad!"

539
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,865
It should come naturally.

540
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:12,237
[RuPaul] At this point in the competition,
I have to ask the question:

541
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,874
who deserves to go home tonight and why?

542
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,979
-Kennedy Davenport.
-I would have to say Fame.

543
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,514
Because clearly, the struggle is real.

544
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,683
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-I would probably say Fame.

545
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,288
She's been in the bottom consistently
over the past three or so weeks.

546
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,657
-Ginger Minj.
-I would have to agree and say Fame.

547
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,560
I don't know
how much more she has to offer.

548
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,595
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-Fame.

549
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,398
She dropped the ball
on her look and her performance.

550
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,100
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-I love her...

551
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:46,638
But I'd probably have to agree
just based on not winning a challenge yet.

552
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,275
-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
-Trixie got to come back.

553
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:54,812
She should be looked at
with a magnifying lens, it should be her.

554
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,383
All right, Miss Fame,
I want to hear from you.

555
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,685
Fuck all these bitches.

556
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:06,324
Truth be told, there's this part of Pearl
that's too cool for season seven,

557
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,694
and that frustrates me
because I'm fighting to stay.

558
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,097
-She knows what I'm talking about.
-I don't.

559
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,100
I don't think
I'm too cool for season seven at all.

560
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,203
I'm actually really surprised
to hear that from her.

561
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,375
Well, my queens,
I think we've heard enough.

562
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:29,080
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

563
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,185
Just between us filthy, dirty girls,

564
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,622
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.

565
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,657
She was hilarious. She had the anger.

566
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:44,128
She could look like a church lady and go
to a rage-filled Divine at the same time.

567
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:48,866
Even though she was doing Dawn Davenport,
she was still putting her flavor into it.

568
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,737
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Katya was certainly ugly drag tonight.

569
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,641
Her performance,
she took this really kind of nothing role

570
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,711
and turned it
into something meaty and substantial.

571
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,880
She was not afraid to play not glamorous.

572
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,416
A lot of drag queens I know
are afraid to do that.

573
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,218
You were looking at me when you said that.

574
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,622
All right, moving on. Ginger Minj.

575
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,860
She embodied Edith Massey as the egg lady.

576
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,996
She really did go balls deep.

577
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,768
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-As Babs, she did a good job.

578
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,971
It still wasn't enough
compared to what Ginger was doing.

579
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,241
-It's hard to compete with a Ginger Minj.
-I've tried.

580
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:36,447
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-She's doesn't give a lot when performing.

581
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:40,885
That outfit--not only is it not ugly,
it's incredibly flattering for her.

582
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,721
So she does not follow directions.

583
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,692
Violet Chachki.
That was the ugliest dress.

584
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,262
[Michelle] She's posed in it,
like when Lucille wore a potato sack.

585
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,997
That moment of "I'm fabulous."

586
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:58,069
I think her performance was about
as talented as a colorblind makeup artist.

587
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,640
-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-She has something that I root for.

588
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,144
When she said, "Fuck those bitches,"
I was like, "Okay, I like her."

589
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,015
-Her ugly dress was not ugly.
-The performance was ugly.

590
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:16,320
If I told her to change something, "no".
She hears, but she doesn't listen.

591
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,358
You know who the star of that scene was?
The dog!

592
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,828
Silence! I made my decision.

593
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,597
Bring back my pussy willows.

594
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,568
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

595
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,172
Kennedy...

596
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,306
you're safe.

597
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,341
Thank you.

598
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,178
Katya, you're safe.

599
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:47,919
Ginger Minj.
This week, you gave us green... eggs...

600
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,688
-And hammed it up.
-[laughs]

601
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,891
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.

602
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,393
Thank you.

603
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,897
[RuPaul] You've won a hair-raising
custom wig wardrobe

604
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,666
from Weaven Steven.

605
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,734
{\an8}Oh, my god, I won another challenge.

606
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,337
{\an8}I'm the first bitch this season
to win three.

607
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,974
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.

608
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,245
-You're safe, <i>huevos ranchero</i>.
-Thank you.

609
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,051
Pearl, your dress
was not a sight for sore eyes.

610
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:25,156
And your Divine performance
was a little B.M.,

611
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,091
Barely Memorable.

612
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:32,196
Violet Chachki,
your ugly dress made us happy.

613
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:36,734
But your Divine performance
was kinda crappy.

614
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:42,039
Miss Fame, your ugly dress
had too much beauty

615
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,775
and your Divine performance
was a real doody.

616
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,380
Violet Chachki...

617
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,316
[sighs]

618
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,219
You're safe.

619
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,787
Thank you.

620
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:03,861
Pearl, Miss Fame, I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both up for elimination.

621
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,931
{\an8}She called me out. I'll send her packin'.

622
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,901
[RuPaul] Two queens stand before me.

623
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:14,939
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip sync performance

624
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,477
of "Really Don't Care" by Demi Lovato.

625
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:24,682
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

626
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,653
and save yourself from elimination.

627
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,757
-The time has come...
-[thunder claps]

628
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,692
...to lip sync...

629
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,362
...for your life!

630
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,535
[Fame] <i>I hate we had to have this energy,</i>
<i>but I have to fight to be here,</i>

631
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,604
{\an8}and I hope and pray that I get to stay.

632
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:51,075
Good luck, ladies. And don't...

633
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,210
fuck it up.

1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,333
- Gorgeous.

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,500
Innocent.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Sexy.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
There's some new glamour girls
in town.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,867
And they're sittin'
on a big ol' secret.

6
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm back!

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,300
[cheering]

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,166
That's right, we're back
for an all-new season

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,100
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,500
the search for America's
next drag superstar.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
[cheers and applause]

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,433
We have 12 hot new queens
willing to do whatever it takes.

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,767
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

14
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:38,834
- Even if that means
they've got to drop, drop...

15
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,500
drop it like it's hot.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,967
[all groan]

17
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:46,233
And in the end, it all comes
down to this.

18
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,000
The time has come...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,467
for you to lip-synch...

20
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,000
for your life.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,300
Are you ready for the ride
of your life?

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,934
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-off.

23
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,200
- More stars.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,900
- Yes, ma'am.
- More fierce.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,133
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.

26
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,300
- More drama...

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,333
- Can we get someone
over here, please?

28
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,433
She can't breathe.

29
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,734
- Than ever before!

30
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,300
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,066
<i>[car engine starting,</i>
<i>tires screech]</i>

32
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:16,233
- A new season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>

33
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:20,066
about to burn rubber in three...

34
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,867
two...

35
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,100
one.

36
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,767
- Holy shit.

37
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:53,700
Oh, wow.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,133
I'm first.

39
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,066
I get to pick my spot,
I guess.

41
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,166
Oh, wow.

42
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,567
I am what I call
a southern belle,

43
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,767
or a very Atlanta girl.

44
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:06,934
I want to be on the end.

45
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm a Cancer, so I'm a big--
just a big mama.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,066
No...

47
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,834
I think I want to be
on this side.

48
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,533
No, that's the changing area.

49
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,800
I want to be on this end.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,133
- Hello, somebody.

51
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,200
- Hello.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,100
- Hi.
- I'm Nicole.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,567
- Hi, Nicole.
I'm Shangela.

54
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,967
- It's nice to meet you.
Tell me your name again.

55
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:29,367
- Shangela, like Angela,
but with an s-h, like "sh."

56
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,166
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,

57
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,433
the debutantess
of the deep south.

58
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,066
All right for the country
bitches in the house.

59
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,467
Shangela is
a little bougie, okay?

60
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,100
But she's also your home girl.

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
How long have
you been doing drag?

62
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,533
- For 15 years.
- No, ma'am.

63
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,633
- Uh-huh.

64
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,166
- All right,
you've got to be perfected.

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,700
- And you?
- Only five months.

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,734
- Oh, wow.
- Fairly new.

67
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,433
- I hope that I don't fall into
that role of babysitting

68
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,767
and start, like,
fixing people's shit

69
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,767
when I should be really,
like, cutting their bra straps.

70
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,233
- What's up, bitches?

71
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,800
My name is David.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,066
In drag, when I've got on tits
and tights, I go by Raven.

73
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,934
Bitch, this is fucking fierce.

74
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,867
- Oh, take a look around, girl.
Get you some.

75
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,867
- You didn't bring a purse
or nothin'?

76
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,967
- I don't carry a purse.

77
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,533
I stick it all in my tits.

78
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,734
- [laughs]

79
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,266
- I like to be that mysterious,
dark ice queen.

80
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,066
And, like, I think I have a look

81
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,233
that people might be
a little intimidated by.

82
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,233
Am I a ten?

83
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,433
A perfect ten.

84
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,433
- What a sin! Ahh!

85
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,166
- Oh, ohh!

86
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,266
- My name's Jujubee.

87
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm 25,
from Boston, Massachusetts.

88
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
- I'm Nicole.

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,066
- I'm Juju.

90
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,333
- Juju? I love that name.

91
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,066
- Bitch, no, you are
Kimora Lee Simmons.

92
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,533
- Jujubee's just
this fabulous Asian girl.

93
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:45,133
She's very, like, poppy
and, like, fashion forward.

94
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,433
She loves accessories
and she likes glitter...

95
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:50,200
'cause it's wicked spah-kly.

96
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,934
- I'm Sahara Davenport.

97
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,133
I'm 25 years old.

98
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,767
And I live in New York City.

99
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,066
Hey, hey, hey.

100
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,400
- Oh, hey.

101
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,433
- Aah!

102
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,066
- Aaah!

103
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,667
[both screaming]

104
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,800
- Sahara Davenport came in.

105
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,433
Sahara and I went
to college together

106
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,667
and have been friends forever,

107
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,834
and I had no idea
she was gonna be on this show.

108
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,066
[both screaming]

109
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,834
- Excuse me, pardon me.

110
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,867
What were you saying?

111
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,133
- [squealing]

112
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,967
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan!

113
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,633
- Bitch!

114
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,066
- My name is Morgan McMichaels,

115
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,533
and I am 28 years old.

116
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,633
- When I saw Morgan walk in,
I wanted to die.

117
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,567
- Hi.

118
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,900
- Ohh!
See, I know somebody.

119
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,133
Morgan's like my sister.

120
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,133
Like, we started doing drag
at the same time, same club.

121
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,467
- Hi, I'm Nicole.

122
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,567
- People think that
since I'm pretty and I'm sexy

123
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,266
that I should just do slutty
all the time.

124
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:49,333
I'm just eating
solid food again.

125
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,300
- Hello.

126
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,900
- I'm Mystique.
- Hi!

127
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,934
- I'm Mystique Summers.

128
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,266
I am 25 years old.

129
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,266
Big girls are gonna represent
this year.

130
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,266
Cheeseburger, Taco Bell, and
diet coke on the side, girl.

131
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,700
- Ohh!

132
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,166
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,

133
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,433
but fuck them skinny bitches.

134
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,667
It's a big girl's world.

135
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,266
- Oh, my god.

136
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,667
My direct persona name
is Jessica Wild.

137
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm from San Juan,
Puerto Rico.

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,367
You like Puerto Ricans?

139
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,333
- I'm 1/4 Puerto.

140
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,867
- I've taken a Puerto Rican.

141
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:24,400
- My biggest fears in the
competition is with my English.

142
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,667
But if I don't understand
something, I am going to smile.

143
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,467
Uh-oh!

144
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,433
- My drag name is Sonique.

145
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,900
I now live in Atlanta, Georgia.

146
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,233
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my god.

147
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,233
- Oh, my God!

148
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,700
- This is Sonique.

149
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,967
Now I know somebody.

150
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,066
- My mom sent me
to a military school in hopes

151
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,066
that she would get
a little soldier.

152
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:47,667
Needless to say,
she got a drag queen.

153
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,400
[laughs]

154
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,467
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

155
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,333
[all greeting her]

156
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,166
- Some pretty bitches in here.

157
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,667
- My name is Tatianna.

158
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,367
I am 21 years old.

159
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:58,900
both: Mwah. Mwah.

160
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,834
- It's a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Tatianna.

161
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,967
- First time I walked out
of the house in drag,

162
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,700
I was 14 years old.

163
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,367
I don't know how I had the balls
to do it,

164
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,967
but I went to school in drag.

165
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,100
It was my closest taste
of being, like, famous.

166
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
Thank you.

167
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,667
- Hey, fake ladies!

168
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,533
[all greeting her]

169
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,800
- I'm Pandora Boxx, and I'm
30-blah-blah years old.

170
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,867
Hey, girls.

171
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,934
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- I'm Pandora.

172
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,967
Pandora is definitely a melting
pot of different people.

173
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,533
You know, there's like a dash
of Madonna,

174
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,533
a sprinkle of Goldie Hawn,

175
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,800
and a big chunk of Kathy Griffin
thrown in there.

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,066
And she has to kind of like fuse
it all together

177
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,900
into this melted pot of goo
that becomes Pandora.

178
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,667
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.

179
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,567
- Aah! Yes, ma'am!

180
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,500
- I made this.

181
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,433
- You better work.
Look at this.

182
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,533
- Me and miss Pandora, we're
gonna be real good friends.

183
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,800
- Oh!

184
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
- Here's another one.
- Oh, excuse me.

185
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,333
- I am Tyra Sanchez, and I'm 21.

186
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,533
- Oh, excuse me.
- Beautiful.

187
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,867
- How gorgeous.
- Da-yamn.

188
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,266
- It's sickening.
- What a body.

189
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,367
- I do think
that I'm the prettiest one.

190
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,834
- Tyra, all right.
Are you bankable, girl?

191
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,066
- [chuckles] Yes.

192
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,867
- I came in,
I had my Rihanna hair on.

193
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:13,433
My body was right, breasts were
right, makeup was right.

194
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,500
Everything was on point.
I was very much a lady.

195
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,066
- I'm super-excited to get
to know the girls.

196
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,066
Different personalities,
different genres of drag,

197
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,133
different styles of drag.

198
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,467
I really couldn't make
a judgment

199
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,300
on who was the strongest
and who was the weakest.

200
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,066
<i>- Ooh, girl!</i>

201
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,934

00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,166

217
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,600
[cheers and applause]

218
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,667
Hello, hello, hello.

219
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:21,867
[cheers and applause]

220
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,133
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

221
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:28,066
- When I see RuPaul enter
the room for the first time,

222
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,567
I'm in a state of shock.

223
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:33,633
- I am gagging
at the lovely extravaganza.

224
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,433
Wonderful. Hello.

225
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,900
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna.

226
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,433
- Holy shit.

227
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,900
I'm shaking the hand
of a legend.

228
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,800
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- From Atlanta, Georgia.

229
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,066
- That's right, the ATL.

230
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,166
You're Pandora.
- Pandora Boxx.

231
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,066
- Pleasure to meet you.
Great, great.

232
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,266
- It's really, really cool to
have somebody that you idolize

233
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,500
come over and just--and say
your name immediately.

234
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,800
- You're all so gorgeous.

235
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,767
- I was a little star struck,
I guess.

236
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,333
- I'm so happy you are all here.

237
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,967
Anybody who steps out
of the house

238
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:06,633
with a pair of high heels
and a wig is my hero.

239
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:12,567
We searched from coast to coast,
and you are the chosen 12.

240
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:16,066
[cheers and applause]

241
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:20,567
All of you are here because you
have charisma, uniqueness,

242
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,867
nerve, and talent.

243
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,834
But do you have that little
something extra it takes to win?

244
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:33,367
The stakes are high, ladies,
but the rewards are fabulous.

245
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,400
In addition to walking away
with the title

246
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,567
of America's next drag
superstar,

247
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,066

[cheers and applause]

258
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,166
All right, ladies, enough talk.

259
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,500
Are you ready
for your close-ups?

260
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,233
[all cheer]
- Good.

261
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:21,934
Now, please put your hands
and legs together

262
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:27,700
for top celebrity photographer
and my good friend Mike Ruiz.

263
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,800
[cheers and applause]

264
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,300
- Okay, ladies, your first
official<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photo shoot</i>

265
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,633
is inspired by one of my
favorite movies of all time:

266
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,500
<i>Gone With The Wind.</i>

267
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,734
- [gasps]

268
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,000
- Yes.

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,200
Now, you'll each pose for Mike,

270
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,467
and then we'll choose
the one queen

271
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:55,567
who gives the best face, face,
face, I give face, beauty, face.

272
00:10:55,567 --> 00:11:00,500
- Oh, my gosh, it's here.
Competition's on, bitches.

273
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,133
[camera shutter snapping]

274
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,400
- Today, we're doing
a photo shoot

275
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,767
which is inspired
by<i> Gone With The Wind.</i>

276
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,367
- What does she need to know?

277
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,066
- It's the height
of the Civil War.

278
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,734
You need to straddle the cannon,
work the piece of fabric, and,

279
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,900
you know, kind of
interact with the guys.

280
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,066
They're being thrust into
an environment, which, you know,

281
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:21,633
they're unfamiliar with and they
didn't have any preparation for.

282
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,066
- Yeah, straddle that cannon,
hon.

283
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,133
- Hold on...hold on right here.

284
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,066
- [laughing]
- And here we go.

285
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,100
- All right!

286
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,066
- Oh, lord! Oh, my God.

287
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:31,066
- Aah!
- Work! Work the fabric!

288
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,800
- Storm comes up, and they're
snapping pictures.

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,066
And I don't know what to do.

290
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,800
- Watch your hair!
Your hair is covering your face.

291
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,700
- Work the camera, Jujubee!
Work!

292
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,166
- I feel a little tug
in the back of my leg,

293
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,667
and I think it's gonna fly off,
so I'm grasping onto it.

294
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,066
And then my lashes are just

295
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,867
flapping back and forth.

296
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,567
That's all I can focus on.

297
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,233
I didn't know where the camera
was at this point.

298
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,633
- We got it!
- All right!

299
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,900
How do you feel, Jujubee?

300
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,567
- I have never been blown
like that in my life.

301
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,066
[laughter]

302
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,800
- Yes, you got a
lot of firepower

303
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,166
between your legs, girl.

304
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,333
Don't nobody make a sudden move.

305
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,500
She might blow it.

306
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,633
- When I saw the fan,
I was excited.

307
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,600
'Cause fans make
everything prettier.

308
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,367
- Okay, and...there we go!

309
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,266
- Ooh! Lord Jesus!

310
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:20,967
When they started cranking up
the fan, I was just like,

311
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,967
ugh, really?

312
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,867
- Watch your hair in your face.

313
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,667
All right, we got it!

314
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,533
Sonique, ride that cannon.

315
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,066
- Yeah, that hits the spot.

316
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,700
Pandora's box is on fire!

317
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
- All right!

318
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,767
- Jessica's a girl gone wild!

319
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,367
Yeah! Serve it!

320
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,133
Suzanne Sugarbaker!

321
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,266
That's what I'm talkin' about!

322
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,266
Hoo hoo hoo!

323
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,934
Triumphant!

324
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,333
As god is my witness.

325
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,900
Uh-oh!

326
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,600
Those damn Yankees took
everything from you!

327
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,834
- Morgan McMichaels had
a problem

328
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,166
with having her wig fly off,

329
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,467
and she tried to recover
from it,

330
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,600
but I find
that she never really did.

331
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,633
- 3, 2, 1!

332
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,533
Okay, we got it.
That's it.

333
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,767
We did get a good shot,
but it was a struggle.

334
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,567
Thank you, Morgan.
- Thanks, Morgan.

335
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,934
Wow, the competition has
just begun

336
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:23,066
and they're already flipping
their wigs.

337
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,133
- Honey, how was it?

338
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,200
- I mean, this wig
went on vacation, girl.

339
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,433
She flew right off.
- [laughing]

340
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,834
- As I see everybody changing,

341
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,700
the thing that stood out most
to me is, kind of forget,

342
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,100
like, how much it really takes
to transform somebody

343
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,467
and how amazingly different
they can look

344
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,300
from--from one to the other.

345
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,467
- I wonder what everyone's
gonna look like out of drag.

346
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,667
I hope some of you are
attractive boys, like me.

347
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,633
- [laughing]

348
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,834
- Nicole Paige Brooks.

349
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,600
- From Atlanta, Georgia.
- That's right.

350
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
- And I will never go hungry
again.

351
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,900
- All right.

352
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,533
- Am I gonna pinch your nipples?

353
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,066
Ohh! They bounce too.

354
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,066
This one's jealous.

355
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,467
- Oh, I think it's leaking.

356
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,467
- Nicole had all
of the southern charm,

357
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,700
but I felt like
in the photoshoot situation,

358
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,200
you know,
she wasn't delivering couture,

359
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,333
she was delivering, you know,
little catalog.

360
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,467
Look off into the distance,

361
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,066
off into the horizon.

362
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,734
Too far off, too far off,
sister.

363
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:20,400
Sahara Davenport had a really
great understanding of her body

364
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,967
and how to move.

365
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,834
Although she didn't have

366
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:27,567
that same understanding
with her face.

367
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,734
- We're gonna sit you
on that cannon

368
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,467
with these
two gorgeous soldiers.

369
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,700
- And I'm like, "Oh, my god,

370
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,867
you want me to stand
next to them?"

371
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,233
- Don't teeter over it.

372
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,667
- I can't cross my legs,
anything.

373
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,800
The skirt is so tight.

374
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm like trying my hardest
to be perfect.

375
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,433
- Chin down a little bit.
Remember the camera's down here.

376
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,467
- Chin down!

377
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,233
- I felt that I could
have did better.

378
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,200
I should have been just, like

379
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
more focused
on the picture itself.

380
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,367
- We got it!
- Got it! Wonderful.

381
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,667
- Be aware of the camera.
Pretty, pretty face.

382
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,166
- Pretty face.
Think Franklin mint plate.

383
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,467
- Ha ha, yeah.

384
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,066
- I wanted to bring
the most fiercest possible.

385
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,200
- Chicken cutlets!

386
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,967
Chicken cutlets.

387
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,467
- But my boobs were falling out
the top of the dress.

388
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,900
RuPaul's screaming,
Mike is screaming,

389
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,066
and through my head is going,
"bitch, pull it together.

390
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,467
Look at that camera
and pull it together."

391
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,967
both: Yes!
- Cover up, dear.

392
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,066
[laughing]

393
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,600
Ooh, is that a possum
in the woods?

394
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,667
[laughter]

395
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,433
Yes, yes!

396
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,066
War is hell!

397
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,400
But you look gorgeous!

398
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,500
- [laughing] Right.
All right, we got it!

399
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,667
- Gorgeous!

400
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,400
- That is
what I'm talkin' about.

401
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
- Yes.

402
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,667
- [sighs]

403
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,734
I love a good blow job.

404
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,433
- [giggles] Brat.

405
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,967
- That was amazing.
Ohh.

406
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,200
I was able to spread my cooch
and air it out.

407
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,834
- Immediately, Raven and Morgan
were kind of off-putting.

408
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,667
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.

409
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:54,700
- We're all staring
at each other,

410
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,400
'cause we're just in shock.

411
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,834
You is naked.

412
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:01,567
- I think Morgan is gonna get
on my nerves.

413
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,967
- Son of a bitch.

414
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,734
- Oh, wait, wait,
these are my wigs.

415
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:08,300
- Do you usually do your own
hair and makeup, or...

416
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,066
- Um...technically, well, no.

417
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,266
The answer is no.

418
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,900
I felt that people
were looking down on me

419
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,066
for only doing this
for five months.

420
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:20,734
It just made me feel more
determined to show them

421
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:21,934
that I can do it.

422
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,133
Bah, bah, bah! Whoop!

423
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,133
Uhh!

424
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,834
- Hey, dolls.
Come on down.

425
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,200
Gather around.

426
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,066
Mike and I went over
all your photos.

427
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,166
You each did a great job.

428
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,266
But only one of you
can be the best.

429
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:45,300
The winner of the first
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photoshoot is...</i>

430
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,867
Raven.
- Oh, my god.

431
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:50,900
[applause]

432
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,266
Congratulations.

433
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,066
- I think me winning the
first challenge is gonna make

434
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,333
the other bitches
kind of open their eyes,

435
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,066
'cause I plan on winning
the grand prize.

436
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,800
- Have fun tonight,

437
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,767
'cause when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

438
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,633
tomorrow is another day.

439
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,667
[alarm beeping]

440
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
- Gather round, dolls.

441
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,467
Now, if you haven't guessed
by now,

442
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,700
<i>Gone With The Wind</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>
the inspiration

443
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,900
for your first main challenge.

444
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,367
Now, Scarlett O'Hara was one
fierce bitch.

445
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:28,066
She survived the Civil War,
the fires of Atlanta,

446
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,100
and the ransacking of Tara.

447
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,166
And still, she was able to turn
out a drop-dead gorgeous outfit,

448
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,967
just using the curtains
in her window.

449
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,600
And now it's your turn to do
the same.

450
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
Inspired by
Miss Scarlett O'Hara,

451
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,266
you must create
your best drag look

452
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:52,333
using just these curtains,
courtesy of smith+noble.

453
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,734
And in the work room, we've got
some used home furnishings

454
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,233
we picked up at
Out of the Closet

455
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,700
that you can use to accessorize.

456
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,500
You'll wear your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.

457
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,834
And when it comes to makeup,
NYX Cosmetics has you covered.

458
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:11,433
Tomorrow, you'll be debuting
your stunning

459
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:16,333
"gone with the window"
drag looks on the main stage.

460
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,700
Raven, since you won
the photoshoot,

461
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,934
you get to choose
your curtains first.

462
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:26,066
Choose wisely.
Take your time.

463
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:29,500
That's what winning
the challenge gets you.

464
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,633
Take note, girls.

465
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,900
- I'm gonna go with these.

466
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,600
- You're going with those?
- Yes.

467
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,967
- No, don't pick that one.

468
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:44,834
- In a moment, I'm gonna let
the rest of you fight it out.

469
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:49,767
And remember, only one
matching set of curtains each.

470
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:54,300
Gentlemen, start your engines.

471
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,400
And may the best woman win.

472
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,333
[giggling]

473
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,500
- There weren't no ladies on
that set today.

474
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,400
There were men
running for curtains.

475
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,867
You pushed me! You pushed me!

476
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:14,867
- This is mine.

477
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:18,367
- It is on now.

478
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,133
- I dashed for the first set
of curtains I saw.

479
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,934
And along came Tatianna,
and she grabbed the same one.

480
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,400
- Reach all you want to.
Reach all you want to.

481
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,266
- Y'all could go get
another one.

482
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,467
- This is mine.

483
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,800
I was like, back up off.
I wasn't letting go.

484
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,600
And so she didn't hold on
any longer after that.

485
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,867
I win.

486
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,533
- I got to the curtain first.

487
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,066
And I pulled it down first.

488
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,834
It really wasn't that classy
of her to do that.

489
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:43,900
- Ooh, I broke a nail.

490
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,600
- Keep it moving, bitches.
- No, sir!

491
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,867
<i>- The rules of the challenge</i>
<i>are pick a set of curtains</i>

492
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,567
<i>and make your costume from it.</i>

493
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,433
<i>We also have to incorporate</i>
<i>homewear,</i>

494
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,367
<i>pieces from Out of the Closet.</i>

495
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:58,233
- I'm going to be flawless
with this.

496
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:01,433
- Pandora, get that table back
there; you can have that one.

497
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,100
- I was trying to figure out
where I was going

498
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,734
and where we were putting
our stuff.

499
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,500
And then Shangela said,
"come over here,

500
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,867
come over to this station,
and we'll work together."

501
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,433
And I was like,
"You want to work together

502
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,800
because you don't know how
to sew, and I know how to sew."

503
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,967
- Could I beg you just to, like,

504
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,433
show me how to sew
that little piece together?

505
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,467
Quickly.
- I guess.

506
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,500
- Hey, I'm not gonna ask him
to do it for me.

507
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,767
I want to learn.

508
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,800
But I need to be right there
next to the teacher.

509
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,066
<i>[squeals]</i>

510
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,600
<i>Look at this.</i>

511
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,667
<i>Look what happened.</i>

512
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,867
<i>Is that supposed to happen?</i>

513
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,100
- Oh, what are you doing?

514
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,166
- I did it.

515
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,667
I just pushed the foot pedal.

516
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,533
- If I don't get to finish my
outfit 'cause I run out of time,

517
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,734
then I'll be like,
"Damn you bitches!"

518
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,133
<i>- Sahara, I'm sewing.</i>

519
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,133
<i>Thank you!</i>

520
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,133
<i>- You better work, diva.</i>

521
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,300
Work!

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,600
- Oh, my god, Pandora.

523
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:55,734
- Mystique felt like the fabric
wasn't plus-size girl-friendly.

524
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:57,600
What size are you?
- 22.

525
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,367
- Really?

526
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:03,834
- Mystique looks like she's
making a huge pillowcase.

527
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,533
For Mystique to sit there
and think that her curtains

528
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:10,367
are not plus-size-friendly
is a crock of shit.

529
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,367
<i>- Bitch...I'm doing</i>
<i>something wrong.</i>

530
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:19,667
- You're doing something wrong?

531
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,066
- Mine is broke.
I broke...

532
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,367
- You what?

533
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,800
You broke the needle?

534
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,400
- No, I just broke
the whole machine.

535
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,233
Yeah, this is an issue.

536
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,767
- So now we're fucked.

537
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,166
- I should get ready,

538
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,967
'cause I'll have to lip-sync
for my life in a minute.

539
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,900
- Hey, is anybody home?

540
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,767
all: Hello.

541
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,467
- Clean up this mess!

542
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:44,900
No, just kidding.

543
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Keep working.

544
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,967
Hi, Mystique.
- Hey, girl.

545
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:49,867
- All right.
How's it going for you?

546
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,367
- Kind of rough.
- Rough? Really?

547
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,700
- Oh, you don't have a, uh...
- No.

548
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,133
- Dress for it.
- This is the biggest one.

549
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,967
- Why don't you pad it?
- I don't got time for that.

550
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,734
- Well, this challenge is about
overcoming adversity and--

551
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,266
- Oh, yeah.
- You'll do it.

552
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:04,900
- Like I said, fucking bitches
fucking up the house.

553
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,600
- I'm gonna come over here
to Shangela.

554
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,734
- Hey, Ru.

555
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,066
- What's your inspiration?

556
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,066
- Well, this is gonna be a hot

557
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,166
gun concoction.

558
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,133
- I see.

559
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,100
- Along with--I'm gonna also do

560
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
some sewing, and Pandora 's

561
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,133
kind of helped show me
the machine.

562
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,200
- I see.

563
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,734
- I might be the new bitch
on the block,

564
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,667
but in order to be on the show,

565
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:24,266
I quit my job, because I love
performing as Shangela.

566
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,600
So I have 100% committed myself
to this.

567
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,400
- Oh, my goodness, corn?

568
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,367
- Yeah.

569
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:30,400
- Are you gonna be using corn?

570
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,300
- It is "the south will rise"

571
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,333
meets<i> Children of the Corn.</i>

572
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,200
- I've seen great potential
in you,

573
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,834
so you've got to--you've got
to bring it, honey.

574
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:38,967
Tyra.
- Hi.

575
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,300
- Hi, honey.
- How are you?

576
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,767
- I'm good.
Now, you have a child.

577
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,333
- I do have a son.
His name is Jeremiah.

578
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,333
- Jeremiah --oh, that's
the tattoo you have there.

579
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,734
- Yeah, tattoo on my arm.

580
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,834
- Why, Jeremiah?

581
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,066
- Um, we wanted a name from
the bible.

582
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,500
My name comes from the bible,
so--

583
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,533
- Tyra 's in the bible?

584
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,500
- No, not Tyra.

585
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
James is in the bible.

586
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,400
- [laughing]

587
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,100
He was born the first week
of my 12th grade year.

588
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,500
It's like the first time I'll be
away from him this long.

589
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
My son is, like, my major
motivation

590
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,900
for winning this competition.

591
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,867
- You know, a family that drags
together,

592
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,333
stays together.

593
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,266
All right.

594
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

595
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,533
- Sahara, hi, honey.

596
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,734
- Hi, Ru.

597
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,200
- You put a lot of work into
this bustier.

598
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,233
- I have.

599
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,567
- And is this the vision you had

600
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,100
from the very start?

601
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,166
- I don't know where I'm going
with it, to be honest.

602
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,700
- Are you a little worried
about that?

603
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,967
- Of course I'm worried!

604
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,066
I still want to be gorgeous,

605
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,200
but I also want to have a good--

606
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,333
a good garment to show.

607
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,300
- Yeah.

608
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,900
I think you got a little bit

609
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,834
more work to do,

610
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,166
so I don't want to keep you.

611
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,333
- All right, thank you.

612
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,533
- Hello, Tatianna.
- Hello.

613
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,500
- This is what you wanted.
- Yes.

614
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
- But you haven't gotten
very far here.

615
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,200
- No.
- What's going on?

616
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,567
- Looking at it from
a distance,

617
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:48,166
I chose it 'cause it looked like
it more of a silver hue

618
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,100
that I could maybe do
silver shoes with.

619
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,533
- Right.

620
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:54,233
So you're looking for an accent
to match your shoes.

621
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,233
- Mm-hmm.

622
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,433
Because to me if you have a--

623
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,166
- You have big feet?
- 13.

624
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,266
- Yeah, well, that never
stopped me.

625
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,333
- But I also don't like to show
my toes.

626
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,834
- You don't like to show
your toes.

627
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,133
- My big toe is shaped
like a doorknob,

628
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,066
and so I don't think
it looks good

629
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,400
in open-toed shoes.

630
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,633
- Well, I mean, just...

631
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,200
crazy--I have got to see
your toe.

632
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,467
Can I please see your toe?

633
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,367
Because you can't go through
life...

634
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,500
- Hiding my big toe?

635
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,166
See?
It's just too big.

636
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,900
- That is a gorgeous toe.

637
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,066
I know people who would pay
to suck that toe.

638
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,133
- [laughs]

639
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,133
- I say let it go.
Let it go.

640
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:28,066
And that advice is gonna help
you in this competition.

641
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,066
You have to go for it,

642
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,567
and don't let anything
stop you.

643
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,333
- Okay.
- Free your toes...

644
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,900
And the rest will follow.
- [laughs]

645
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,367
- Hey, Jessica.

646
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,834
Can I see what you're doing?

647
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,767
- Yes, I get this because
I love the color,

648
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:44,367
but it is very clear,

649
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,967
and I have problems
with that,

650
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,767
because I don't want to look
like I am naked.

651
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,800
- You don't want to look
like a whore, do you?

652
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,533
- No!
Not on camera.

653
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,266
- [laughs]
Maybe after the show.

654
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,200
- Yeah.

655
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
- What's underneath here?

656
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,400
- I use a corset.

657
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,066
- Oh, is it a corset
you brought from home?

658
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,066
- Yes, and I make this.

659
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,567
- I make in...

660
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,133
Sorry,
explain it in Spanish.

661
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,600
- Just a little top,

662
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,400
and you could say it in Spanish
if you like.

663
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,734
- Yeah?
- Yes.

664
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:12,734
- Okay...

665
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,166
[speaking Spanish]

666
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,166
-<i> Si.</i>

667
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:22,667
- [speaking Spanish]

668
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,300
-<i> Muy bien, muy bien.</i>

669
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,800
Ooh.

670
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,066
- Because it's going to give
a special touch.

671
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,600
- Oh, wow.

672
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,500
Now, do you pad anything?

673
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,233
- I don't have a lady body.

674
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,500
- Can we see?

675
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,767
- I have a guy butt.
- [laughing]

676
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:41,533
- And I need to make the curves
of a lady.

677
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,166
- I can't wait to see it
on the main stage.

678
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,834
- Thanks, Ru.

679
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,700
- All right, I'm gonna move
over here

680
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,667
to see miss Morgan
and see what you're up to.

681
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,300
- Hi.
- What are your plans for?

682
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,133
- Okay, now, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do with the sleeves.

683
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,367
But I think I'm gonna do
the high neck

684
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:56,533
and maybe try and incorporate
this into it.

685
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:57,734
- Ah, wow.

686
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:58,967
- I got this.

687
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,066
- Uh-huh.

688
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,066
- You know, which is huge.

689
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,467
I could use this as a skirt,
really.

690
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,100
- And you feel like you have
enough time?

691
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,300
- Um, I will make time.

692
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,567
I will get it done.

693
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,533
- I see.

694
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,700
All right, ladies.

695
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,834
<i>Gather round.</i>

696
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,967
I'll see you tomorrow on
the main stage,

697
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:19,367
where our extra-special guest
judge will be...

698
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,667
Kathy Griffin.

699
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:21,700
- [gasping]

700
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,934
- I really identify with
Kathy Griffin.

701
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,567
I love her, so I'm excited that
she's gonna be here.

702
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,400
- Now, remember, in this world,

703
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,467
you only get one chance to make
a first impression.

704
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,100
So don't fuck It up.

705
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,767
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>

706
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,200
- I'm kind of scared about what
the judges are gonna say.

707
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,533
With this hot-ass mess I'm gonna
wear out there tomorrow,

708
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,433
this is gonna be brutal.

709
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,567
- Whoo! Burning!

710
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,200
[all chattering]

711
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,900
<i>- Tonight is my first day that</i>
<i>I'm going to walk the runway.</i>

712
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,367
So I have a lot of great
emotions.

713
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,867
- Are you nervous?

714
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,800
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

715
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,934
The only thing on my mind
is finish this garment.

716
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,934
- What you think, Sahara?

717
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,367
- Ooh, yeah.

718
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,700
- I think Mystique is a mistake.

719
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,066
<i>- I love doing drag because</i>
<i>I love the transformation--</i>

720
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:24,066
<i>the costuming, the hair,</i>
<i>the makeup.</i>

721
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>The glamour of it all.</i>

722
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,066
It is an art form.

723
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,300
<i>- To be able to change yourself</i>

724
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,333
<i>into a completely different</i>
<i>person</i>

725
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,333
<i>is very empowering.</i>

726
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,467
- Yes.

727
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,633
- Yes!

728
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,367
- Hey, you guys.

729
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,533
So happy to see all of you.

730
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,967
Santino,
so good to have you back.

731
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:56,967
- I've missed you.

732
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,867
- Merle, you look marvelous
tonight.

733
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,500
- My world's been empty
without you, Ru.

734
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,233
- Hey, Mike, what do you think
of our queens so far?

735
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,600
- Oh, I'm very impressed.

736
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
- And miss Kathy Griffin,
welcome to the show.

737
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,500
- Ru, I cannot believe that you
dismembered our first lady

738
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
and stole Michelle Obama's arms.

739
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,066
They are perfect, as are you.

740
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:21,100
- Okay, judges, for this week's
challenge,

741
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,767
inspired by miss
Scarlett O'Hara,

742
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:27,467
the girls had to turn
out a breathtaking drag look

743
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:31,100
using just curtains
and some used home furnishings.

744
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,233
Are you ready to see what
they've created?

745
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,266
Gentlemen, start your engines.

746
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:40,433
And may the best woman win.

747
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:47,400
<i>- I think that I do have</i>
<i>a good chance</i>

748
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,734
<i>at winning this challenge.</i>

749
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,834
<i>My dress looks amazing.</i>

750
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,066
<i>- I love the fabric</i>
<i>of the underdress.</i>

751
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,100
<i>It's actually the carpet</i>
<i>and the drapes.</i>

752
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
- Oh, wow.

753
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,266
<i>- And they don't match,</i>

754
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,333
<i>and they don't need to,</i>
<i>not today.</i>

755
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,700
<i>- That's so 2000.</i>

756
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,934
<i>There is nothing dirty about</i>
<i>this Sanchez.</i>

757
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,467
<i>- Here comes some sass.</i>

758
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,233
<i>- Yes, sassy miss Raven.</i>

759
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,867
<i>- My runway walk is giving them</i>

760
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,066
<i>a little hip action.</i>

761
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,967
<i>Flip of the hair,</i>
<i>working it out,</i>

762
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,400
<i>giving them sex.</i>

763
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,734
<i>- I do like the focus</i>
<i>on the waist.</i>

764
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:13,700
<i>- Yes, now she--</i>

765
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,734
<i>- Even when there isn't one,</i>

766
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:15,734
<i>she kind of manufactured one.</i>

767
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:16,934
<i>- That's right.</i>

768
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,567
<i>- Which is essential</i>
<i>in your business.</i>

769
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:19,600
- Wow.

770
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,700
<i>- Sonique, boom.</i>

771
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,367
<i>- Yes.</i>

772
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:23,767
<i>- Southern belle, African,</i>

773
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:27,066
<i>playboy mansion,</i>
<i>all rolled into one.</i>

774
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:31,066
<i>I definitely think that no one</i>
<i>else came up with that concept.</i>

775
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:33,567
- I wonder what she uses
that rod for.

776
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:35,433
<i>Here is Jujubee.</i>

777
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,934
<i>- I feel great--</i>
<i>sickly, gorgeous.</i>

778
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,500
<i>I wasn't going for pretty.</i>

779
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,834
<i>I was going for fierce.</i>

780
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,834
<i>I put on my feathers</i>

781
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,834
<i>and I felt like a big ol' style</i>
<i>warrior goddess.</i>

782
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,467
<i>- Lauren Bacall would love</i>
<i>that collar.</i>

783
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,767
<i>- Yes.</i>

784
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,066
<i>- She will wrestle you</i>
<i>to the ground for that collar.</i>

785
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,266
<i>- Everyone's doing redhead,</i>
<i>Kathy.</i>

786
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:54,300
<i>- Look at those gams.</i>

787
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,700
<i>- The legs are killing me.</i>

788
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,333
<i>- I didn't really know what</i>
<i>to do.</i>

789
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,033
<i>The lights are in my eyes.</i>

790
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,567
<i>I see Ru 's teeth glowing</i>
<i>at me.</i>

791
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,166
<i>Freaking out inside.</i>

792
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,400
<i>- She's serving some</i>
<i>Raquel Welch there,</i>

793
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,266
<i>and I don't just mean her hair.</i>

794
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,266
<i>- Sahara.</i>

795
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,066
<i>- Uh-oh, it's raining.</i>

796
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,600
<i>- She is throwing</i>
<i>some serious shade.</i>

797
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,433
<i>- We'll see her poolside</i>
<i>in South Beach.</i>

798
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,867
<i>- I'm excited to work</i>
<i>the runway.</i>

799
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>That's one of my favorite</i>
<i>things.</i>

800
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,166
<i>- I like the mix of the blues.</i>

801
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,633
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Looks great.</i>

802
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,900
<i>- It's refreshing.</i>

803
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,400
<i>- As I step onto the runway, it</i>
<i>can be a little intimidating.</i>

804
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,533
<i>You don't want to fuck It up in</i>
<i>front of RuPaul.</i>

805
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,967
<i>- There's corn hanging</i>
<i>from her hand!</i>

806
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,600
<i>- What is that corn doing</i>
<i>there?</i>

807
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,834
<i>- I've been corn cobbed.</i>

808
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,166
<i>- It's a co--you been</i>
<i>corn cobbed?</i>

809
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,533
<i>- Yes.</i>

810
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,000
<i>- Jessica Wild.</i>

811
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
<i>- Wild flower.</i>

812
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,834
<i>- It's inspiring, a movie that</i>
<i>I never saw.</i>

813
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:50,433
<i>But in my imagination,</i>
<i>that girl is amazing,</i>

814
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,033
<i>like Jessica, so...</i>

815
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,400
<i>- How did she get it back from</i>
<i>the sweatshop so quickly?</i>

816
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,133
<i>'cause it looks like it took</i>
<i>many, many children</i>

817
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,066
<i>to make those flowers.</i>

818
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,100
<i>- You're absolutely right.</i>

819
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,467
-<i> It's a lot of work.</i>

820
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,934
<i>- Morgan McMichaels.</i>
<i>Look at that body.</i>

821
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:03,800
<i>- My attitude is a positive</i>
<i>one.</i>

822
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,066
<i>I will not go home.</i>

823
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,967
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>will not send me home.</i>

824
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:10,333
<i>- I love the little belt</i>
<i>and the little belly jewel.</i>

825
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,433
<i>- I love the little eyelids</i>
<i>there.</i>

826
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,367
<i>- And I never met a grommet</i>
<i>I didn't like.</i>

827
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,767
<i>- Yeah, grommets are fabulous.</i>

828
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,433
<i>- Me too. I don't know</i>
<i>what that is, but I agree.</i>

829
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,467
- [laughing]

830
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,066
<i>All right!</i>

831
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,934
<i>- That's not just an outfit;</i>
<i>it's a lifestyle.</i>

832
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,266
<i>- Who needs a hybrid</i>

833
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:26,233
<i>when you could have a basket</i>
<i>on your head?</i>

834
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,633
<i>- I pulled out every single</i>
<i>trick that I have in the bag.</i>

835
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,066
<i>- Ohh!</i>

836
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,500
[laughter]

837
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
<i>- If I was gonna go home,</i>

838
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,166
<i>I was gonna be memorable</i>
<i>for something.</i>

839
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,433
<i>- Nicole Paige brooks.</i>

840
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>- My outfit's like the madame</i>

841
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,567
<i>running the saloon</i>
<i>down the street</i>

842
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,133
<i>from the Tara</i>
<i>that's burning down.</i>

843
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:46,066
- Yes, miss thing's got a little
bustle in her hustle.

844
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,767
Vivien Westwood
does Vivien Leigh.

845
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,100
- Oh, my God,
I wish I 'd said that!

846
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,700
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>

847
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,867
- I can't believe that bitch

848
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,166
went into my purse
and took that wig.

849
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,533
<i>I just can't even believe it.</i>

850
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:58,934
<i>- It's like a body double.</i>

851
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,467
<i>- There's only one chance</i>
<i>I'm gonna get</i>

852
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,967
<i>to walk a runway in front</i>
<i>of Kathy Griffin,</i>

853
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,066
<i>and I am wearing that wig.</i>

854
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:08,667
<i>- Hello, dolls.</i>

855
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,367
I have to say,

856
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,900
anyone who has the courage
to break free

857
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,767
and follow their heart
is my hero.

858
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,333
Based on your "gone with
the window" challenge,

859
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,600
your photoshoot,

860
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,133
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,

861
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:27,066
I've made some decisions.

862
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:31,433
When I call your name,
please step forward.

863
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,867
Jujubee.

864
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,934
Tatianna.

865
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,500
<i>Raven.</i>

866
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,066
<i>Sonique.</i>

867
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,367
Jessica Wild.

868
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:46,400
Nicole Paige Brooks.

869
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,433
Here's the bad news.

870
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,500
None of you are the best.

871
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,533
And here is the good news.

872
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:59,467
<i>None of you are the worst.</i>

873
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,633
<i>Congratulations...</i>

874
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,800
you're all safe.

875
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,767
- I don't fucking like
being just safe.

876
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,900
I wanted to be one
of the top ones.

877
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,734
- As you move forward in this
competition,

878
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:14,567
I have one piece of advice
for you.

879
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:17,467
<i>Step up your game.</i>

880
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,400
You may leave the stage.

881
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,233
For you six, one of you will be
the winner of this challenge.

882
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:30,600
And for one of you,
it's curtains.

883
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,100
Now, we're gonna begin
with Tyra.

884
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,400
So these are the curtains
you started with.

885
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,734
<i>- I would have liked</i>
<i>to have seen</i>

886
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:38,734
<i>just a little more originality.</i>

887
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:41,600
<i>- I don't mind that it's not</i>
<i>necessarily innovative,</i>

888
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,066
but it is a very classic shape.

889
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,533
- I have a very small criticism,

890
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,367
which is just maybe have a
little more fun with your face.

891
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,867
Smile, more facial expressions.

892
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:50,633
And remember, it's drag.

893
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,300
So give me face.

894
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,100
- Let's take a look at your
photograph with Mike Ruiz.

895
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,834
What was going through
your mind?

896
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,200
- Pose, but don't fall.

897
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
- I disagree.

898
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,467
I think falling on those
two guys

899
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,433
would have been the best thing

900
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,066
that could have happened
that day.

901
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:06,266
<i>- Shangela, tell us what this</i>
<i>outfit says about you.</i>

902
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,567
- Well, you know, a little fun,

903
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:09,767
a little rough around the edges,

904
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,233
because I'm fairly new
to the drag world.

905
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,300
- Your bust line
is non-existent.

906
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,934
There's no waist definition
there.

907
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:19,200
<i>- Wow.</i>

908
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,066
- I think you need to have
a better understanding

909
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,900
of how to relate your face
in a photo shoot situation.

910
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,300
<i>- Morgan McMichaels, what does</i>
<i>your outfit say about you?</i>

911
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,233
<i>- I thought warrior.</i>
<i>- I love it.</i>

912
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,133
<i>I love it because I'm calling</i>
<i>you Chergefani.</i>

913
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,834
You're like a little Cher,
a little Fergie,

914
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,433
a little Gwen Stefani.

915
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:38,734
- And Cher wore something like
that in her<i> Half Breed</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>

916
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:40,066
[imitating Cher]
In<i> Half Breed.</i>

917
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,200
[laughter]

918
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,667
- It reads as a lot
of different things,

919
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,200
and that could have gone
horribly wrong.

920
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,567
But it worked.

921
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:48,867
- So how much?

922
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:50,500
[laughter]

923
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,934
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>

924
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,133
<i>- It's like looking in a</i>
<i>mirror, it really is.</i>

925
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,166
- Kathy, would you say she's

926
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,433
the most beautiful
of all the queens?

927
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,734
- Well, obviously.

928
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,367
[laughter]

929
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,834
<i>- Wow!</i>

930
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,266
<i>Now, see, I wish that some</i>
<i>of the energy in this photo,</i>

931
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,667
<i>you could bring to the main</i>
<i>stage in your presentation.</i>

932
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,400
- Here, you're very demure
and girly.

933
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,567
There, you're like belting it
out like Judy Garland

934
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:13,734
on barbiturates
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> amphetamines!</i>

935
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:15,934
- Mystique Summers Madison.

936
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,133
- I'm torn about the dress.

937
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,066
Remember, it is the first
impression.

938
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,266
- I may be a big girl,

939
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:22,500
but I can get down with
the skinny bitches

940
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,300
and wear something short
if I want to.

941
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,867
[laughter]

942
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,934
<i>- Now, is that your breast</i>
<i>coming out?</i>

943
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:30,233
- Got milk?

944
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:33,200
[laughter]

945
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,233
- All the humor we're seeing
from you now,

946
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,600
I would loved to have seen
in that picture.

947
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,567
<i>- Yes.</i>

948
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,667
- That's right--
know who you are,

949
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,300
and deliver at all times.

950
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,133
<i>All right, Sahara Davenport.</i>

951
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,066
<i>Your first impression for us.</i>

952
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,834
- Well, my boyfriend's Asian,

953
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,767
so I went with the parasol.

954
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:50,467
- Well, nothing says Civil War
like my Asian boyfriend.

955
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:52,133
[laughter]

956
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,567
<i>I love the dress, I just don't</i>
<i>think it's draggy enough.</i>

957
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,800
- I agree; it probably could be
a little more flamboyant.

958
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,500
- I'm a New Yorker.
I'm always on the move.

959
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,834
So I decide to do something
a little more contemporary.

960
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:05,367
- But, with that said, you know,
this is a drag competition.

961
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,600
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>Well, thank you, ladies.</i>

962
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,166
While the six of you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,

963
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,600
the judges and I will
deliberate.

964
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,266
<i>Thank you.</i>

965
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,767
Okay, now just between us girls,

966
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,900
we've got a little work to do.

967
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,166
<i>Let's talk about Mystique.</i>

968
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,333
That outfit was raggedy as hell.

969
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,967
<i>I mean, the split was even</i>
<i>raggedy,</i>

970
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,166
<i>but it was entertaining.</i>

971
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,233
- If they were at a drag show

972
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,333
and she did that split,

973
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,900
all the gays would go crazy
and cheer.

974
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,200
Bad dress, though.

975
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,066
- Her humor kind of sells,
like, the raggedy dress.

976
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,066
- Shangela.

977
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,133
<i>- Too old-fashioned looking.</i>

978
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,567
<i>- She had a lot more</i>
<i>personality</i>

979
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,500
<i>in the question and answer part</i>
<i>that the walk.</i>

980
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,633
So she definitely could really
learn how to perform, I think.

981
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:47,433
<i>- We're not judging potential</i>
<i>a year down the line.</i>

982
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,934
We're picking a drag superstar
today.

983
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:51,467
- Today.
This is<i> RuPaul's Drag Race;</i>

984
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:54,533
not RuPaul's School for Girls.

985
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:55,700
<i>Sahara.</i>

986
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,166
- Chic and wonderful and sweet
and great poses,

987
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,934
but I don't know if she really
has the fabulousness.

988
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,066
- Exactly, you know.

989
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,633
It's all about
the razzle dazzle.

990
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,500
You know, and we didn't really
get to really see that.

991
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,467
<i>- Tyra.</i>

992
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:07,600
- Beautiful, great visual.

993
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,800
Great dress, great hair,
great makeup.

994
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,266
Where's the personality?

995
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:13,767
- Wessonality--none whatsoever.

996
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,467
<i>Morgan McMichaels.</i>

997
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,967
- I didn't really get
the fun personality.

998
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,166
- I loved the concept.

999
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:23,133
Overall, just a really
well-executed look.

1000
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,200
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>

1001
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
<i>- She was really humorous,</i>

1002
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,233
<i>and I thought her look</i>
<i>was great.</i>

1003
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:30,066
<i>- She needs that sort of drag</i>
<i>personality like that.</i>

1004
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:32,066
"I'm taking the stage,
I'm owning it.

1005
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,233
I'm here, bitches."

1006
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:35,800
- With that said, silence!

1007
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,433
Let's bring the girls...

1008
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,400
back in.

1009
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,066
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>

1010
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,967
Tyra Sanchez...

1011
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,100
The judges loved your look.

1012
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,433
But...do you have
the personality

1013
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:56,600
to be the next drag superstar?

1014
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,934
Congratulations.

1015
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:00,300
<i>You're safe.</i>

1016
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:07,734
Shangela...you have an
irrepressible energy,

1017
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:13,700
but can energy make up
for a lack of experience?

1018
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,967
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're up for elimination.

1019
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,767
- I expected to be
in the bottom group.

1020
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:25,266
<i>Now I'm thinking in my head,</i>
<i>let's turn it out.</i>

1021
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:29,133
- Morgan McMichaels, you made
a lasting first impression

1022
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,266
with the judges,

1023
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,333
and you are the winner
of this challenge.

1024
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,533
[applause]

1025
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:36,900
- Thank you very much.

1026
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,934
- You will receive immunity

1027
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,967
from next week's elimination.

1028
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,133
- Yes.

1029
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,467
- Plus, you'll be doing a
photo spread

1030
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:48,100
for Interior Illusions
that will be featured in

1031
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,433
<i>Lux</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>

1032
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:51,600
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1033
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,934
- Thank you very much.

1034
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,533
- Winning any challenge in this
competition is amazing.

1035
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,333
But to win the very first one,
I set myself a high bar.

1036
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,266
- Pandora Boxx,
congratulations.

1037
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:03,333
You're safe.

1038
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,800
- Thank you.

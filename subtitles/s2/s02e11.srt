-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,667
And then there were three.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,467
Jujubee.

4
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,734
- What a sin. Ah!

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,233
I have never been blown
like that.

6
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:13,367
- I just absolutely loved her.

7
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,934
I thought she was dynamite.

8
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,100
- Miss Tyra.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,300
Was your barbecue cancelled?

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,633
Your grill is fucked up.

11
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,700
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,500
- I'm America's sweetheart.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,133
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

14
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,834
- What do the bags say?
They say "Santino"?

15
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,333
[uproarious laughter]

16
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,333
It's daddy's little girl.

17
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,600
Tyra Sanchez, you raised the bar
on this competition.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,233
Oh, my sweet gherkins!

19
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,166
You tore it up, Miss Thing.

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,467
Raven.

21
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,000
- Am I a ten?
Cocka-doodle-doo.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,233
- The blending.

23
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,066
It's severe up in here.

24
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,300
- A perfect ten.

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,433
- I would not leave my man
in a room alone with you.

26
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:55,667
- Don't do it.
I'll work...it.

27
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,133
- One of you will be crowned

28
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:01,066
the next drag superstar.

29
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,166
And tonight...

30
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,133
[all screaming]

31
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,200
The final three queens

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,500
go head-to-head
and toe-to-toe.

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,367
- Oh!

34
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,266
- Snap out of it, girl.

35
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,433
In this season's
stunning conclusion...

36
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:21,400
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar is...

37
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,700
[cheering]

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,066
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,166
will receive a lifetime supply

40

and a cash prize of $25,000.

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,934
And may the best woman win.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,834
- Top three, bitches.

50
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,867
- Oh, I know that's right.

51
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,333
- Get up in here.

52
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,066
- "Do you to the fullest.
Love, Tati."

53
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,333
I saw so much more in Tatiana.

54
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,900
She just kind of halted
and stopped.

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,400
- You gonna clean this mirror?

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,700
- Why do I have to clean it?

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,133
- 'Cause you out-lip-synch her.

58
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,367
- And you sent her home.

59
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,333
And that was your friend.

60
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,266
- How did you feel having
to lip-synch for your life

61
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,300
a third time?

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,967
- I thought I was going home.

63
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,100
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>The Story of Jujubee--</i>

64
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,867
both:<i> I'm still here.</i>

65
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,433
- What if I wasn't here,
though?

66
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,133
- Then Tati would be here, and
there would be no competition.

67
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,633
Only a competition
between me and Raven.

68
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,266
- We're in the top three.

69
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,266
- Ah!

70
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,467
[all laughing]

71
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,300
There were two times
where I thought, "Fuck."

72
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
And it was the times
I was having

73
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,433
to lip-synch for my life,
and I thought, "Damn it."

74
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,533
- Oh, there were three times
where I thought that too.

75
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,600
- But we made it, bitch.

76
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,700
- I thought I was going home
that week

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,900
when all my bridesmaids
fucking jumped on me.

78
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,500
- I think you need manners,
girl.

79
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,834
- You don't need to tell me
anything, Miss Thing.

80
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,700
It was just like,
"I need to let her know."

81
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,333
'cause I didn't want you
to go home and--

82
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,633
and be like that with people

83
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:25,266
and have people talk about you
and you not wonder why.

84
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,066
- But you said it
in front of Ru,

85
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,166
which made the judges think

86
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,200
a completely different thing
about me.

87
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,667
- It did at the time,

88
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,400
and now they see it
differently,

89
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
and they see that you've grown.

90
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,100
So I did you a favor.

91
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,233
[clicks tongue]

92
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,500
- Ooh, girl.

93
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,066
You've got she mail.

94
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,934
Well, look who's here.

95
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,166
The best of the best.

96
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,367
You stand on the shoulder pads

97
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:56,467
of a dynasty of drag queens
who have come here before you.

98
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,600
So forget about those
bickering real housewives.

99
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,633
They ain't seen
nothing yet...

100
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,667
till they go head-to-head
and toe-to-toe

101
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,500
with the realness
that's about to explode

102
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,367
as one queen survives the fight

103
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:18,100
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar.

104
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,667
[car engine running]

105
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,133
- Surprise.

106
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,133
- Good for us.
- Hello, hello.

107
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,633
- Whoo.
I'm shocked.

108
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
what are you guys doing here?"

109
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,800
- Congratulations on making it
into the final three.

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,967
all: Thank you.

111
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,100
- We're here because RuPaul
is getting ready

112
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,367
for your final challenge,

113
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,867
inspired by some
of the great bitchy catfights

114
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,233
of all time.

115
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,133
You'll be costarring
in RuPaul's new music video,<i> </i>

116
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>Jealous of My Boogie.</i>

117
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
- You'll need to learn
to fight dance

118
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,066
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.

119
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,066
- And then with video director
Mathu Anderssen

120
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,467
you'll each have your moment
to act opposite RuPaul

121
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,700
in an over-the-top
dramatic scene.

122
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,900
- Plus, you'll work
with style expert Robert Verdi

123
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,133
to turn out two looks

124
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,367
inspired by '80s
power bitch fashion.

125
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,800
- This is your moment to show us
every bit of the charisma,

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,433
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent you've got.

127
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:16,133
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.

128
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,800
And for the last time...

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,767
both: Don't fuck it up.

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,166
- Not only are we that one step
closer to winning this,

131
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,433
but we're now gonna be
in RuPaul's new video.

132
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,533
[all screaming]

133
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,533
So we need to be on our A game.

134
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,066
This is the final challenge.

135
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,200
- [lisping] I'm so excited
right now, guys.

136
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,066
- Hello.
- Hi, ladies.

137
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,166
How's it going?

138
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,934
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- Hi, I'm Ryan.

139
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,633
- The first thing
that we go out to learn

140
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,934
is the fight choreography

141
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,100
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.

142
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
- So let's go from the top.
Let's come up here.

143
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
The inspiration for this piece

144
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,066
was taken from the classic
TV show<i> Dynasty.</i>

145
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,100
It's bitchy, it's exciting,

146
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,600
it's campy.

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,266
So from the get-go,
it's a stomp, stomp, stomp.

148
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,367
You're a video vixen now,
yeah, okay?

149
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:05,400
I just think they really have
to be stars,

150
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,834
you know, when they're
in front of the camera.

151
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,300
They should already be living
as if, you know,

152
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,600
they are the new RuPaul.

153
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
-<i> ♪ Can't stop now ♪</i>

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,100
<i>♪ Won't slow down ♪</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Five, six, hup.

155
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,066
-<i> ♪ I gotta emulate the BPM ♪</i>

156
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,900
- Go.
Up, down, up, up, ah.

157
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,333
Up, up--
- Ryan's very just high-octane.

158
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,834
He's very, like, "Duh, duh."

159
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,166
- [scatting]

160
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,533
Ooh, uh, fucking fierce, uh.

161
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,900
Pop pop, pop pop.

162
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,767
Four, five, six,
seven, eight.

163
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,100
Click, click, click,
click, click, click.

164
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,066
Hup, hup, hup.
Walk it out.

165
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,133
A little bit of booty
thrown in.

166
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,333
Pff, pff, pff,
pop pop, pop pop.

167
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,533
Yes, cool.

168
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,400
- He is the tiniest
little fiercest

169
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,066
little white man
in the world.

170
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,400
- Circle, circle, circle,

171
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,467
circle, circle, circle, circle,

172
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:53,166
and circle and circle
and circle.

173
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,633
- Fuck, I keep--
I forget that part.

174
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,734
I think it's gonna be hard
counting out those first beats

175
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,500
to know when we start circling
like a shark.

176
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,066
- Raven's a little bit slow
picking up choreography,

177
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,700
and that's a little bit
of a concern.

178
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,967
Click.

179
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,867
Other side, click, click.

180
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,433
- So it's--

181
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,066
- Not back to front.
- Okay.

182
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,900
- Let's listen to it 'cause
what--it's really fast, okay?

183
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,433
- Tyra's really monotone
with her attitude,

184
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,166
which makes me
a little bit nervous

185
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,066
because you need to be
hitting it in rehearsal

186
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,900
in order to hit it later on.

187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,066
One, two, three, four.

188
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,400
Five, six, seven, eight.

189
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,100
This has to be bigger.
Don't fake it, yeah?

190
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,667
If they don't bring
their personality

191
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,734
and the steps are a little shy
of being what they should be,

192
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,266
it could be a disaster.

193
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,734
So and then I think from there,

194
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:38,200
you guys just kind of catfight
like true<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fashion.</i>

195
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,066
This is where it gets
really dramatic.

196
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,734
Five, six, seven, eight!

197
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,166
It shouldn't be
six, seven, eight.

198
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,367
It should be six, seven, bam!
And smack her, okay?

199
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,166
- Keep your heels off my toes.

200
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,567
- Keep your toes
under my heels.

201
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,767
I hope these bitches
don't take my eye out.

202
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,800
- And you're just gonna put
your hand on her wig.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,734
So you have to really be careful
of her heels.

204
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:59,300
- The timing needs to be perfect
so it looks real.

205
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,066
- Hit, five, six, seven, eight.

206
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:02,934
Uh-huh.

207
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,133
Jujubee's overall realness

208
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,333
of being totally catty
and bitchy,

209
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,734
if she can really bring that
up to another level,

210
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:10,900
it'll be great.

211
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,834
Let's go back from here.
Just shake it down.

212
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,166
We have 15 minutes.
Let's go.

213
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,967
Ah, ah, ah.
See, you have to hold.

214
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:17,934
You come across, Raven.

215
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,667
You go one, two, three, four,

216
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,133
and look, six, seven, eight,

217
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,300
then walk, two, three, four,
to shove.

218
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,533
- Got it, okay.
- Yeah?

219
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,667
- When you're doing it
with three people total

220
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,266
and two of them are nailing it

221
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,633
and you're over there,
like, barely hammering it--

222
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,934
I'm thinking this is
gonna be a catastrophe.

223
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,500
- Okay, cool.
Thanks, ladies.

224
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
- Thank you.
- Bye.

225
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
- I know y'all jealous of my

226
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,867
[high-pitched voice] boogie.

227
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,266
- Don't be jealous
of my boogie.

228
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,166
- Oh, my God,
I feel so fierce.

229
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,233
Did you guys ever think
that when you were a little boy,

230
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,900
that you were gonna be
in a RuPaul video?

231
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,834
- No.
- No, me neither.

232
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,433
I thought I was gonna be
a doctor.

233
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:53,300
We have a ton of stuff to do
for this video shoot, okay?

234
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,266
We have to do a scene
with RuPaul.

235
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,667
We have to learn the words.

236
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,900
- Ru?

237
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,133
- Who is it?

238
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,700
- Who is it?
Like, with attitude.

239
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
- Who is it?

240
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,867
We have to prepare
a fight scene,

241
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,667
and then we have lunch
with Ru.

242
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,367
- Five, six, seven, eight.

243
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,400
- Hi, Ru.

244
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,967
- Tyra Sanchez, have a seat.

245
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:16,533
- Thank you.
- The other Tyra.

246
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,834
Two.

247
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:18,967
- Thank you.

248
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,567
- You've come a long way.

249
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,066
- What's been the toughest part
of this?

250
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,433
- Staying focused
and not worrying so much

251
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,633
about my son
and what's going on back home.

252
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,633
Like, and I'll pray to God,
and the tears just fall.

253
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,934
- Why do you cry, though,
when you pray?

254
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,367
- Because I just feel
that God is listening.

255
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,367
I held it in for a long time,

256
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,500
and, like, that's what made me,
like, angry.

257
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,834
- Anger is always
a symptom of fear.

258
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,567
What are you afraid of?

259
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,700
- I'm afraid of losing my son.

260
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,433
I really, really want to be
a better father to Jeremiah.

261
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,934
- So winning this contest
would mean what to you?

262
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:54,100
- I've been through so much

263
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,967
from being kicked out
to living on my own

264
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,367
and then raising a son.

265
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,066
So it's like a fresh start.

266
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,867
Just because I made mistakes

267
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,867
doesn't mean his life
has to be a mistake.

268
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,800
I was so surprised that I told
her about things in my past,

269
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
what went on with me.

270
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,467
Ru has definitely, like, grown,
to be, like, my drag mother.

271
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,467
- Thank you, Tyra.

272
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,967
- Thank you.

273
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,900
- Hey, Jujubee.
How are you?

274
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,567
- Hi.
- What's going on? I'm Robert.

275
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,667
- Nice to meet you.

276
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,367
Robert Verdi is giving me
a consultation.

277
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm like, "Oh, my God,

278
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,867
you smell so good
and you're so handsome."

279
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,433
- I'm gonna give you
an outfit to wear,

280
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:28,400
and I'm gonna help you pick out
an '80s look in your wardrobe.

281
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,500
You have to channel these

282
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,467
dramatic fabulous women
of the '80s.

283
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,800
Are you aware of any of them?

284
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,266
- No.

285
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,266
- What year were you born?
- '84.

286
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,533
- Oh, my God.

287
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,834
- I know.
- [mouths words]

288
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,734
What do you think you're
gonna do for this challenge?

289
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,567
- Does this do anything?

290
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:43,967
- These two things
go hand in hand?

291
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,066
- Yeah.

292
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:48,166
- It looks more
Ringling Brothers than '80s.

293
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,533
- I've seen
Whitney Houston's videos.

294
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,400
She just looked
like she was going to the prom.

295
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,066
- This has an '80s vibe,

296
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,367
but the shoulder would be...

297
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,667
- Bigger, right?
- More defined.

298
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,033
The waist would be more defined.

299
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,033
Who were the women
in the canon of history

300
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,834
that you look to
for inspiration?

301
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,367
- Honestly,
I look at Mary J. Blige,

302
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,900
and I look at, like,
the Beyoncés and all that.

303
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,433
- It's not really history.
- Yeah, and, you know--

304
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,367
- That's contemporary.

305
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,934
- I'm a little nervous.

306
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,467
I have no idea where to start.

307
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
- Hello, Raven.

308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,066
- Hello, how are you?
- Have a seat, darling.

309
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:22,066
- We get to go have
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.

310
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,066
- Oh, a buffet.
- Yes.

311
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,100
- Would you like a mint,
darling?

312
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,333
- Just one.
- Just the one.

313
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,600
- There.
- Thank you.

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,667
Sitting there having lunch
with RuPaul

315
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,700
was one of the most surreal
things I've ever done.

316
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,867
- You know,
I wonder what it's like

317
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,533
to be sequestered this way.

318
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,700
Do you feel like
a prisoner of war?

319
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,800
- I mean, I do miss
talking to my mom.

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,467
I speak to my dad, you know,
a couple times a month.

321
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,600
I guess I'm closer with my mom
than I am my dad.

322
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,233
- They're not together.
- No.

323
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,300
- When did they separate?
- When I was seven.

324
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,400
- You know, I--

325
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,367
my parents divorced
when I was seven also.

326
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,900
It was really tough on me,

327
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,066
and I think I went into music,

328
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,266
into sort of
an imaginary world.

329
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,233
What reaction did you have
to their divorce?

330
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,066
- I look at my mother.

331
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,967
She's, like, my golden
Oscar statue, you know?

332
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,567
And I love her.

333
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,066
And when I saw
what she went through

334
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,533
with my father's divorce,
it killed me.

335
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,467
And I swore, I said,

336
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,500
"I will never do that
to anybody in my life."

337
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,166
And whenever I've gotten
into a relationship,

338
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,533
it's really killed me
because I'm, like,

339
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,967
"Why do I have to be
my mom now?"

340
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,867
And a lot of times when you're
with someone and they hurt you,

341
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,700
you don't want to have
anything else to do with them.

342
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
- Expectations
lead to resentments,

343
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,533
and when you allow people
to just be themselves,

344
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,467
the relationship
can really grow.

345
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,967
- It was very nice to sit there
and talk with Ru one-on-one

346
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,600
and it be about me,

347
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,066
not all about drag and shop
and all that.

348
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,467
- Our lunch has to end now.

349
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,066
Can we get a doggy bag?

350
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,100
- Thank you.

351
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,867
- [laughing]

352
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,433
- Tell me about your persona.

353
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,734
Tell me about Tyra.

354
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:54,300
- Well, Tyra is, like,
sophisticated, glamorous.

355
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,367
- Okay, you're gonna be
shooting a video,

356
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,633
and your characters
are going to be styled

357
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,066
to look like they're
'80s vixens.

358
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,066
It was a decade of power
for women,

359
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:07,967
and women were really defined
stylistically

360
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,133
with very sharp shoulders,

361
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,867
very small waist,
and some bling.

362
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,834
- I wasn't born
when the '80s were hot.

363
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,700
I was born in the late '80s,
like, '88.

364
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200
- You have the privilege
of working

365
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,367
with one of the most amazing
performers in the world,

366
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,834
who draws inspiration

367
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,300
from the most incredible women
in history.

368
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,800
And you should probably
take a minute to research

369
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,333
because I think you'll be able
to refine your character.

370
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,567
- Darling.
- Hi.

371
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,900
- Welcome.
- How are you?

372
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,367
- Have a seat.

373
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,066
- I will.

374
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,667
- How many
of these delicious mints?

375
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,667
- Just two.
- The two.

376
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,133
I'm on a diet,
so I'll just have one.

377
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,200
You were in the bottom two
three times.

378
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,700
- Three times.
- How did that happen?

379
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,467
- Well, I've been in
the bottom two three times here,

380
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,934
and I've been in the bottom two
a lot of times beforehand.

381
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,300
- Tell me about that.

382
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,433
- Just growing up, you know,

383
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,300
having people
just make fun of you.

384
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,767
I used to answer to faggot.
- Really?

385
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,900
- I just accepted it
'cause I knew it wouldn't stop,

386
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,967
and then finally, I just said,
"You know, don't call me that."

387
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,066
- Wow.

388
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,667
You know,
you got a lot of strength

389
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,633
for such a young lady.

390
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,567
What do you think your dad would
think of you in this contest?

391
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,333
- Oh, he would give me
the biggest hug,

392
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,967
and he would say,
"Go for it."

393
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,066
You know,
now it's Jujubee's journey.

394
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,200
Talking to Ru today,
she brought up situations

395
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,400
that I never talk about,

396
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
and it was just so comforting

397
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,500
to have her just listen.

398
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,667
- Thank you, darling.

399
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:30,767
- Thank you so much, mama.

400
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,166
- All right,
I'll see you later on.

401
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,734
- So do you have
any reference point

402
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,333
for what this challenge
is about?

403
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,200
- I would picture
the Carringtons.

404
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,266
- You do picture
the Carringtons.

405
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,433
- Yes.
- So you do know who they are.

406
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,467
- Yes.

407
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,734
- Are you the oldest
of the remaining--

408
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:44,967
- I'm the oldest.

409
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,300
- So you actually have
maybe an upper hand in it

410
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,700
'cause you were more in tune
to this decade

411
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,767
than the other two would be.

412
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,066
- Yes.

413
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,800
If you want to work
and you want to have longevity

414
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,066
in this business,

415
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,333
you need to know a little bit
about everything.

416
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,400
- [laughs]

417
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,433
I love that jacket.

418
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,200
How many shoulder pads
are in yours?

419
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,166
- Two.

420
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,433
I'm like--

421
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,767
- Are you ready?

422
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,600
Are you ready?

423
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,066
- You got black nail polish?

424
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,266
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:17,734
Should I even risk it
and try to polish them?

426
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,567
- That's up to you, girl.

427
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,667
This is a competition.

428
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,100
- Let's make movies.

429
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,734
Okay, here we go.

430
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:31,867
- So I'm the first one out
for the dramatic scene with Ru.

431
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,600
- Action.

432
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,667
- RuPaul.

433
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,967
- Who is it?

434
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,166
- Step into her, Raven.

435
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,667
- RuPaul.

436
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,066
- Who is it?

437
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,533
- I really need to talk to you.

438
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,066
I know that--

439
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,300
I forgot what my--my line is.

440
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,333
- Cut.

441
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,266
And action on Raven.

442
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:53,467
- RuPaul.

443
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,867
- You know I can't see you
before the show.

444
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,500
It's against the rules.

445
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,066
- Well, I'm sick of your rules,

446
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,633
I'm sick of your challenges,

447
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,066
and I'm sick of your show.

448
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,400
- Cut.

449
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,900
Try and get a little more
roller coaster in your ride.

450
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,066
- Okay.
- Do you know what I mean?

451
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,400
- I'm sick of your rules,

452
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,066
I'm sick of your challenges,

453
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,066
and I'm sick of your show.

454
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,934
What about me?
What about Raven?

455
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,333
- I was a little disappointed
at first with Raven,

456
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,133
but she took direction,
and she paid attention,

457
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,633
and there was
an actual progression.

458
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,834
- What about Raven?

459
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:30,467
Oh! Oh. Oh!

460
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,066
Oh! Oh.

461
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,734
- Ru?

462
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,834
- Who is it?

463
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,934
- I am so glad
I caught you alone.

464
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,100
- Cut.

465
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,333
Can you just make it
a little more seductive,

466
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,100
just throw in a bit of that?

467
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,200
Action.

468
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,734
- What about me?

469
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,834
What about Tyra?

470
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,600
- Snap out of it.

471
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,834
Pull yourself together, girl!

472
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:57,967
- Cut.

473
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,467
I want you to play this
a little bit--

474
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,567
it's like
when she shuts you down,

475
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,433
be really hurt
when she slaps you,

476
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,400
be really hurt.

477
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,233
- Like, hood?
Like how hood?

478
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,200
- Go for it.

479
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,567
- Oh, hood or hurt?
- Hurt.

480
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,934
- When he said "hurt,"
I thought he said "hood."

481
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,066
- Well, do we want that?

482
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,266
- That sounds pretty good.

483
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,867
- I am sick of your rules.

484
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,700
What...about me?

485
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,600
- Snap out of it, girl.

486
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
You better pull yourself
together.

487
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,300
- You are just jealous

488
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,867
of my boogie.

489
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:35,333
- [laughing]

490
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,967
- [laughing]

491
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:40,834
- Hello, darling, you gorgeous
little shoulder-padded monster.

492
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,767
- I feel 100% confident
about this.

493
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,066
I was a theater major, honey.

494
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,066
I know what to do.

495
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,834
- And action.

496
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:48,834
- RuPaul.

497
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,533
- I can't see you
before a show.

498
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,734
It's against the rules.

499
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,667
- I'm tired of these rules.

500
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm tired of the challenges.

501
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,433
I'm tired of this show!

502
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,967
What about me?

503
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,200
What about Jujubee?

504
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,900
Ah!

505
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,333
[babbling tearfully]

506
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,400
- Jujubee came fully loaded
and a surprise

507
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,967
by throwing herself
on the floor.

508
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,266
- You're jealous of my boogie!

509
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,066
- But Jujubee
just is a drag clown.

510
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,066
Cut.

511
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,467
Cut, cut, c-cut, c-cut, cut.

512
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,533
- Right from the top, please.

513
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,800
- Would you do it
once more for me?

514
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,567
- What about me?

515
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,166
What about Jujubee?

516
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,800
- Snap out of it.

517
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:37,800
- [singing indistinctly]

518
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,066
<i>♪ Jealous ♪</i>

519
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,433
Oh, yes, I'll do that.
Oh!

520
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:44,066
It's time for us to shoot
the dance routine

521
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,200
for RuPaul's video.

522
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,166
I'm so excited!

523
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,367
It's us three.

524
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,066
We're the Supremes right now,
okay?

525
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,700
And we have to shoot
this video,

526
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,467
and it needs to be perfect.

527
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,066
Are we all doing bodysuits?

528
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,433
- Oh, those look too big.

529
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,367
- Raven and I got ready
so quickly.

530
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,800
- Yeah, you could see my
bathing suit lines in it.

531
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Oh, well.
- We picked out our outfits.

532
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,767
We put it on.

533
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,934
I feel like Lucy Liu.

534
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,100
- I don't like these.

535
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,800
That looks too small,
doesn't it?

536
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,233
- Tyra had to go
through every fucking thing.

537
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,266
- Can I fit this?

538
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,066
Can I put on a tutu?

539
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,500
I don't like this.

540
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,600
Look at my stomach.

541
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,934
You don't buy stuff in my size,
do y'all?

542
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,600
- Girl, they gave me
these clothes; they fit me.

543
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,300
You're just a little taller
than I am.

544
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,934
Like, you can find something.

545
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,834
- This isn't gonna work.

546
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,700
At all. None of this.

547
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,967
I have so much to choose from.

548
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,066
It was just so hard
to choose something

549
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:44,166
that would top everything
I've done this entire season.

550
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,467
- How are you feeling, Tyra?

551
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,433
- They didn't have no fucking
Clothes to fit me.

552
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,066
And now I don't feel pretty.

553

But I can't do anything
about it.

608

It's big unruly, ugly hair,

628
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,100
really tiny waists,
and fat asses.

- The way that
I'm gonna pull it together

631
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:57,967
for the '80s challenge is,
like, they had big hair,

they believed
in their chandelier earrings,

633
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:03,433
and they like
the Lite-Brite colors.

634

Do I look '80s?
- Yes.

what we're gonna do is,

you're gonna be sharing
the same space.

Like, he'll be able to stay
with me

698
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,800
and live with me there.

699
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
- Where are you staying now,
girl?

700
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,500
- Girl, I stay
with my drag mama.

701
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,433
I stay on her couch.

702
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:23,767
I need this.

703
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:27,066
I couldn't dare go home
without the crown and the title

704
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:29,633
of being America's
next drag superstar.

705
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,066
- So is anyone nervous?

706
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,066
- No.

707
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:38,467
Are you?

708
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,266
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous.

709
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,667
- I'm not nervous.

710
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,266
And I know being nervous
is normal and fine,

711
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,467
but I'm ready.

712
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,233
- [laughing]

713
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,066
- Hello, judges.

714
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,200
How are you, Santino?

715
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,367
- Doing great, Ru.

716
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,533
- Merle, how are you tonight?

717
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:11,600
- I'm nervous for the girls.

718
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,100
- We've made it
to the final lap.

719
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,567
Tonight, we're crowning
America's next drag superstar.

720
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,800
Santino, Merle,

721
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,934
you've been here
since the beginning.

722
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:26,266
You know these ladies
inside and out.

723
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:31,767
So tonight, there are no
guest judges, Miss Thing.

724
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:34,066
It's just family.

725
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,734
- Good.
- [laughs]

726
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:39,734
- Now are you ready for their
final main stage presentation?

727
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:40,800
- Ready.

728
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,066
- Bring it on.

729
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,967
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.

730
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:48,400
And may the best woman win.

731
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,500
Jujubee.

732
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,266
Ooh.

733
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,567
- Le pouf.
- I love this dress.

734
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,166
Oh, I was living for myself,
girl.

735
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,066
I wish I could have seen
my reflection.

736
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,333
- Yes, touch all of the skin.

737
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,700
- Touch all of the skin,
darling.

738
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,934
Oh...

739
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:09,900
I think Jujubee must have
bronzed her panties.

740
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,934
Ooh. Cabaret.

741
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,367
2010.

742
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,066
That's so Raven,
that's so cabaret.

743
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,266
- I feel fabulous.

744
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:21,233
I feel like, "Wow, I'm here.
I made it."

745
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:23,500
And I'm coming out
the way I want to come out.

746
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,433
-<i> Willkommen</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

747
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,934
And all that jazz.

748
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:30,600
Ooh.

749
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,066
Yes, mama. Style proper.

750
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,600
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

751
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,633
Yummy.

752
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:39,834
- Do you know
where you're going to?

753
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,200
- Yes. Mahogany.

754
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,367
I'm a winner, baby.

755
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:47,266
- I am so nervous right now.

756
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,200
And it hit me that, bitch,

757
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,967
you have a great chance at being
America's next drag superstar.

758
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,533
- The Beverly Hills Hotel.

759
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:55,600
- Ah, yeah.

760
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,834
- Polo Lounge.

761
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,233
- Yes. Poolside.

762
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:01,934
Oh, Tyra, darling.

763
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,667
Dive into the deep end.

764
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,367
Mm, the water's fine.

765
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,066
- [laughs]

766
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,367
- Welcome, ladies.

767
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:14,200
Tonight, one queen's life
will be changed forever.

768
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,066
Which one of you has
the charisma,

769
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:21,934
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

770
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:25,333
to be the next drag superstar?

771
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,200
Let's find out.

772
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,734
Jujubee.

773
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,100
Let's take a look at highlights

774
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
from your final challenge.

775
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,100

<i>♪ Don't be jealous</i>

782
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,567
- I am tired of the rules.

783
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,433
I'm tired of these challenges.

784
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,834
I'm tired of your show.

785
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,767
What about me?

786
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,767
What about Jujubee?

787
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,600
- Hmm.

788
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,066
- Oh...

789
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,734
- Snap out of it, Jujubee.

790
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,467
Wow.
[laughing]

791
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,867
- Wow.

792
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,367
- Tell me about
the acting challenge.

793
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,400
Was it difficult?

794
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,500
- Not stepping into your light,

795
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,066
that was really, like,
my concern.

796
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,066
- Trust me, I moved all
the girls out of my light.

797
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:26,066
- If this was
a regular TV show or movie,

798
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,800
I would say, "Jujubee
is overacting like crazy."

799
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,100
But for<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> '80s,</i>
it was perfect.

800
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,467
- I'm a little let down

801
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:37,233
that you've chose to wear
this dress at the end here.

802
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,734
I get where you were going
with it,

803
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:41,834
but not the perfect dress
for this evening.

804
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:46,300
- I think the necklace makes
the dress look less expensive

805
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,700
and less fashion.

806
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,133
- Do you want me
to take it off?

807
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,433
- Sure, if you want
to take it off.

808
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,533
- No, no, I'll take it off.

809
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,400
- Let's see what it looks like.

810
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,066
- Yeah, you look
so much more expensive and chic.

811
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,734
- Oh, right, yes, it does,
actually.

812
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:59,166
- I'm gonna leave it right here.
- Okay.

813
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,066
Now, if it winds up
in my pocketbook,

814
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,200
don't hate me.

815
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,900
- Girl, there's
three stars missing.

816
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,033
You can already have it.

817
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,600
[laughter]

818
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,567
- Next up, the other Tyra.

<i>♪ Don't be jealous</i>
<i>of my boogie ♪</i>

826
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,834
- I am sick of your rules,

827
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,200
your challenges, your show.

828
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,133
What about me?

829
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,734
What about Tyra?

830
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,900
- Snap out of it.

831
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,800
The fighting.
[chuckles]

832
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
You were pretty rough.

833
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,734
I couldn't take my eyes off
of you in that scene there.

834
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:45,100
- Usually when you see
girls fight,

835
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,700
they're not worried
about being pretty.

836
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,467
It's, "I'm gonna beat
this bitch ass,"

837
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,734
and so I'm like--
that's all I'm thinking.

838
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,700
I just wanted that
to really happen.

839
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,633
- You snatched her wig off.

840
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,100
- I didn't do it intentionally.

841
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,467
It was like
I was reaching for her,

842
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,433
and the wig came off, but--

843
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:02,567
- You didn't do it
intentionally twice?

844
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,867
- [laughs]
- Love the hair.

845
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:07,800
Love how just open
and popping your face is.

846
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,367
It's really stunning.

847
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,633
Overall, I think
it's a great look.

848
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:14,700
- Now, are you gonna let
your son watch this show?

849
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,867
- I think that this might be
the first time

850
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:20,533
that he realizes
what daddy does.

851
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,567
And I'm--I'm pretty sure
he's gonna--

852
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,734
we're gonna sit down
and watch it together.

853
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,600
- All right, Tyra.
Thank you very much.

854
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,066
- Thank you.

855
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,200

to Miss Raven.

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,166

867
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,066
Closer.

868
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:56,400
Let mommy make it better.

869
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:04,433
That was just too good
to pass up!

870
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,800
What was the toughest part
about the acting challenge?

871
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,433
- Looking at your face.

872
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,700
- [laughs]

873
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,433
I get that a lot.
[laughs]

874
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,367
- You always looked beautiful,
but that was--

875
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:17,500
probably the hardest part
was looking at your face

876
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,834
and trying not to just be
like--

877
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,934
- [laughing]

878
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,600
Now, what are you serving us
on the main stage tonight?

879
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,200
- Well, I have this corset,

880
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,433
and I think this just
kind of speaks for itself.

881
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:29,400
- What does it say?

882
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,467
- I'm the next drag superstar.

883
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,734
- [laughing]

884
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,367
- Don't slap me again,
please.

885
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,467
[laughter]

886
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,900
- I'm so in love
with this outfit.

887
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,934
I love a black, like,
floral thing

888
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:42,900
because you expect organza
and petals

889
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,166
to be kind of pink.

890
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,533
And when they're black,

891
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,166
it's kind of like this
weird Gothic feeling.

892
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,600
- In the fight scene,

893
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,700
there was a period of time
over a minute

894
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,533
where I couldn't even see you.

895
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:56,200
Tyra was standing up,
and, like, you kind of got lost.

896
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,266
- I didn't want to hurt anyone,

897
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:01,100
so I didn't go for it
completely.

898
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,066
- Your '80s look,
it was totally '80s.

899
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,667
If there's any time
in this whole competition

900
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,300
that you really looked
like Kelly LeBrock,

901
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,567
it was--
it was that time.

902
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,533
- All right.
Thank you.

903
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,767
Ladies.

904
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:18,400
While you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

905
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,333
the judges and I
will deliberate.

906
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,333
[car engine turns over]

907
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,800
Okay, here we are
at the moment...

908
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,867
- Oh, my God.

909
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,867
- That it all boils down to.

910
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,700
Let's start with Jujubee.

911
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,800
She has star quality.
- Mm-hmm.

912
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,834
- But is she
the next drag superstar?

913
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:36,500
- To me, in the context
of these three people,

914
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,400
she looked a little bit
like a tourist.

915
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,467
Her level of iconography
in terms of fashion and beauty

916
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,433
is not where the other two's is.

917
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:46,900
- She excelled
in the book challenge

918
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,533
because she's a clever girl.

919
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,633
She's clearly the most
intelligent of all the girls.

920
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,834
- I'm not sure.
- Really?

921
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,700
- I think Tyra
is incredibly intelligent.

922
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,567
- Let's talk about Tyra.
She's not polished.

923
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,233
She is very hood.
She's very street.

924
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:04,066
But the fact that she's learned
these old-school tricks

925
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:06,266
that we've seen displayed
on this stage

926
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,667
at such an early age
and wowed us with them--

927
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:13,600
even her tenacity to
"accidentally" rip her wig off,

928
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,734
you know, she's saying,
"I'm here."

929
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,433
- Right.
- "I'm the star."

930
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:19,567
- I love people
who are the shit

931
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,066
and know they are the shit.

932
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:24,367
I get both of that from--
from Tyra and Raven.

933
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,567
- Yeah.

934
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,967
- I just think her personality

935
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,700
is so interesting and complex.

936
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,066
And that is part of stardom.

937
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:33,266
- She's been able to show us
so many different looks

938
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,066
and be
so many different women.

939
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:38,900
- Raven is really more
the fashion-forward girl.

940
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,767
Raven has
undeniable star quality.

941
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,100
- Superstar quality.

942
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,133
- Mm-hmm.

943
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:47,133
You know, normally right now,

944
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:50,300
I would say
I've made my decision.

945
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,967
But I can't say that I have.

946
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:56,934
I must see them lip-synch
for their lives

947
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,133
to make my decision.

948
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:01,066
Silence.

949
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,633
Bring back...my girls.

950
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,367
Welcome back, ladies.

951
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,633
We've reached that point
in our journey

952
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:16,834
where one path ends
and another begins.

953
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:20,900
I'm so proud
of each and every one of you.

954
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,066
- It almost seems like
RuPaul's got a shotgun

955
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,767
and is just waiting to, like,

956
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,266
"Okay, you're not it,
you're not it."

957
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,200
That's what it feels like,
a sitting duck.

958
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,967
- Jujubee.

959
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,734
You've brought a light
to this competition

960
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,567
week after week,

961
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:46,800
a light that nothing
and no one can extinguish.

962
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,266
You are a bright star.

963
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:56,066
But sadly, you are not
the next drag superstar.

964
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm sorry, Juju.

965
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,600
- Thank you.

966
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,867
- We will see you soon.

967
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:05,166
But for now, sashay away.

968
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,100
- Bye.

969
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm not bitter.

970
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,633
I'm disappointed.

971
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,100
I wish I was up there
lip-synching.

972
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,600
But I'm still a winner,
and I'm proud of my girls.

973
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,734
I'll get my time.

974
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:20,200
"Love, Juju...B."

975
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:28,533
- Tonight, my two best girls

976
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:32,100
will lip-synch to my single

977
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,834
<i>Jealous of My Boogie.</i>

978
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,066
- This is my first time
I'm gonna have to lip-synch.

979
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,467
I am so nervous right now.

980
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:43,200
- Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me

981
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,633
and win the title

982
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:48,834
of America's
next drag superstar.

983
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:54,333
- I'm ready to win this shit.

984
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,967
- The time has come...

985
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,400
for you to lip-synch...

986
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,834
for your life.

987
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,333
Good luck.

988
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,266
And for the last time,

989
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:10,433

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
- That was amazing.

1044
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,133
- Wow.

1045
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,633
- Ladies.

1046
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,467
I have made my decision.

1047
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,367
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

1048
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:21,967
America's next
drag superstar, is...

1049
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,800
Tyra Sanchez.

1050
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,867
[applause]

1051
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,500
- Oh, my God.

1052
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:42,133
[hyperventilating]

1053
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:45,767
- Girl, turn to the camera.

1054
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,333
You want to take your shoes off?

1055
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,700
Girl.

1056
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,867
Do you need someone?

1057
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,133
Can we get someone over here,
please?

1058
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,567
She can't breathe. Literally.

1059
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,633
- [continues hyperventilating]

1060
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,600
- Tyra, you're gonna be okay.

1061
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,033
- Are you okay?

1062
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:08,433
- Okay, do you need water?
Do you need--

1063
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,934
Does she need to breathe
in the paper bag?

1064
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,266
- [exhales deeply]

1065
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:19,533
It's like I had
an out-of-body experience

1066
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:20,600
and I just--

1067
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,233
for some reason,
I forgot to breathe.

1068
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,333
- Just relax for now, Tyra.

1069
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,100
We're gonna get your wig
back on your head.

1070
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,400
Take your time, baby.

1071
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,867
Tyra, you're gonna be okay.

1072
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,433
We're gonna continue.

1073
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,133
Raven.

1074
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:41,333
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1075
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,200
You are unforgettable.

1076
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,133
And that...is so Raven.

1077
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:48,066
- Thank you.

1078
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,333
- Good luck, my dear.

1079
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1080
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,667
Now sashay away.

1081
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,200
- [silently] Thank you.

1082
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:59,033
I came in second place.

1083
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,100
That's an amazing thing
out of 12 people.

1084
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,333
I'm gonna leave this competition
with my head held high.

1085
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,667
I'm gonna go off
and do something fierce,

1086
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,367
fabulous, fun, and funky,
the four Fs.

1087
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,066
- My queen.

1088
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,467
- Go girl.

1089
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:14,600
Yes!

1090
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,367
- Wear this crown with pride.

1091
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,367
The other Tyra is dead.

1092
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,100
Long live the new Tyra.

1093
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,900
[applause]

1094
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,266
All right.

1095
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:28,734
- Being America's
next drag superstar

1096
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,500
is going to change my life
dramatically.

1097
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,667
I'll be able to take care
of Jeremiah,

1098
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,300
and I'll be able to start
his future now.

1099
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,066
- Tyra, let the world be
jealous of your boogie.

1100
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:41,433
Now walk.

1101
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:53,800
[applause]

1102
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,600
- I am Tyra "the other Tyra"
Sanchez.

1103
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,734
And I am America's next drag...
superstar.

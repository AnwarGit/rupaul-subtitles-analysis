00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,867
hanging from the ceiling,

183
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:38,934
wearing these shoes.

184
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:41,066
- Oh.

185
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,233
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

186
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,066
Absolut Grapevine platforms.

187
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,300
- You know I'm designing for
your new iron fist line, right?

188
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,500
- Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah.

189
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,700
I really wanted to take you to,

190
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,867
like, an exotic
vacation hot spot.

191
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,567
Like for all those, you know,
women that are at home,

192
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,767
they can just put on their shoes
and have a cocktail,

193
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,333
and bam, they're on vacation.

194
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,500
- [chuckles]

195
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,600
All right, next up,

196
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,867
Sharon Needles.

197
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:06,433
- My Berri Sour platforms
are inspired by red rocks

198
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,100
of the southwestern America,

199
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,600
and I'm serving you
some Navajo realness.

200
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,900
And we have these
dream catchers in the back.

201
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
I prefer nightmare catchers,

202
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,233
but these do the trick.

203
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,433
- These are platform shoes

204
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,367
for the real "nava-hos".

205
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,066
- [cackling]

206
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,900
- I thought we were
supposed to design a shoe,

207
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,734
not just slab on a piece of fur.

208
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:28,066
- May I see
the dessert platter next?

209
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,066
- Um, yes.
Let me get you a dessert.

210
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,467
Are you guys good on coffee?

211
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,600
- Good on coffee right now.
- Good on coffee? Yeah.

212
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,900
- Everything tasting all right?

213
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,066
- Yeah.

214
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,967
- Next up, Chad Michaels.

215
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,767
- This is for the girl on the go
on New Year's Eve to wear,

216
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,367
and she's got her Greyhound
in the foot to go.

217
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,233
- Oh, now, what makes that
Greyhound in the foot?

218
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,333
- That's grapefruit juice.

219
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,333
- Of course. Okay.

220
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,567
- Absolutely.

221
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,567
Need a little vitamin C.

222
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,600
You don't want scurvy, you know.

223
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,700
- No, no, not again.

224
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,333
I'll never go
through that again.

225
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,400
- [chuckles]

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,066
- Ladies, you all stepped it up,

227
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:04,433
but one of you really walked
all over the competition.

228
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:08,700
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

229
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,567
Phi Phi O'Hara.

230
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,700
- Yeah! Hot dog.

231
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,333
- Condragulations, Phi Phi.

232
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,600
I am head over heels

233
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,567
for those shoes right there.

234
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,900
And thank you, Jeffrey Moran.

235
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,533
- Of course, anytime.

236
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,300
- We will see you tomorrow
on the main stage.

237
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
- Look forward to it.
Good luck.

238
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
- Bye. Thank you.

239
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,066
- Speaking of platforms,

240
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,200
I want to find out

241
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,934
what America's
next drag superstar

242
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,800
really stands for.

243
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,667
And this being an election year,

244
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,567
it's time to make
some "herstory".

245
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,633
I, RuPaul,
would like to announce

246
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:52,567
the candidacy
of Phi Phi O'Hara, Dida Ritz,

247
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,400
Sharon Needles, Latrice Royale,

248
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,066
and Chad Michaels

249
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,900
to become the first
drag president

250
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,667
of the United States of America.

251
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,066
For this week's main challenge,

252
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,533
you'll face the nation

253
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,667
in a "Frock the Vote"
presidential debate.

254
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,834
This is your chance to prove

255
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,066
that you have the kind of
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,

256
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:21,266
and talent it takes to be
the leader of the free world.

257
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:24,367
Gentlemen, start your engines.

258
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:28,066
And may the best woman...win.

259
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,066
- To prepare for the debate,

260
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,667
we have to do
an opening statement,

261
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:33,867
a closing statement.

262
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:34,867
We have to get in drag.

263
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,066
We have to come up with slogans.

264
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,900
So there's a lot
involved in this challenge.

265
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,300
- [snickers]

266
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,066
- I'm gonna get in trouble.

267
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,066
- Put her away.

268
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:46,066
- [laughing] What?

269
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,066
- Put her away.

270
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,533
- No way. Why would I?

271
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,734
- Why would you?

272
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:52,066
- I'm bringing back
the funk to America, honey.

273
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,900
I decided to do a
non-traditional character

274
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,100
and do something
a little bit edgier,

275
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,667
a little bit more dangerous,
take a risk.

276
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,567
How you doing?

277
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,266
- Two pink afros on a brown wig.

278
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,500
For him to pull that piece of
crap out and put it on his head,

279
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,467
like, for a presidential debate.

280
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,967
- I'm gonna give you lady pimp.

281
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,867
- For today's main challenge,

282
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,734
we're running for president...

283
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,734
in drag.

284
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,633
- It's like we're back in
school.

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,400
♪ La la la la la ♪

286
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,567
So...

287
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,033
♪ Bow bow bow bow-wow ♪

288
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,734
The workroom is insanely quiet
right now.

289
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,533
And, like, everybody is just
thinking so hard

290
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,533
about their stuff,

291
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,967
and I'm just having a good time.

292
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,266
[belching]

293
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,300
[still belching]

294
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,000
[sighs loudly]

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,934
- I'm having the worst
brain fart right now.

296
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,400
- [belching]

297
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
[still belching]

298
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,834
Excuse me.

299
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,767
- I'm so confused.
[laughs]

300
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,367
This challenge is so tough.

301
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,867
I'm just struggling
with coming up with ideas.

302
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,734
Politics is not my comfort zone.

303
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:04,066
- I get it.

304
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,100
- I'm done.

305
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,333
- Work.

306
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,467
- Girl.

307
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,900
- Whew.

308
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
- You better come for it,

309
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,967
miss Phi Phi.

310
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,800
- I feel confident
in this challenge

311
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,333
because I always like to argue.

312
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,133
Y'all didn't take
debate classes in school?

313
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,233
- Uh-uh.
- I did.

314
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,734
I wanted to be a lawyer
when I was younger.

315
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,934
- That's why you're so
confrontational all the time.

316
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,467
- I just have to be right.

317
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,700
- Even when you're wrong.

318
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,834
- Bitch, I'm never wrong.

319
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,100
- You're wrong right now.

320
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,433
- Learn it.

321
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,100
- Are you writing answers
to your questions already?

322
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,600
- Yeah, aren't you done?

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,400
I mean, I took debate, like,
for seven, eight years.

324
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,700
- [laughs]

325
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,967
- And I'm a lawyer,
so hurry up and get it done.

326
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,734
- Hello, hello, hello.

327
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,100
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, Ru.

328
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,667
- Ladies, I hope you're decent,

329
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,300
because we have company.

330
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,700
Journalist, political pundit,

331
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,800
and founder of the
It Gets Better Project,

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,900
Dan Savage.

333
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,200
- [contestants cheer]

334
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
- Awesome.

335
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,533
- Hello, candidates.

336
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,867
- Now, Dan's here to help you
prep for the big debate

337
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:05,367
and serve up
some political realness.

338
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,233
Hey, Latrice.
- Hey, Ru. How are you?

339
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,300
- Have you come up
with a campaign slogan?

340
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,266
- Of course.

341
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,100
"Everyone needs
a piece of Latrice."

342
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,967
- What about
"Peace with Latrice"?

343
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,233
- Ooh, that's very good.

344
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,133
So what is your platform?

345
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:22,066
- Well, I want more funding
for HIV and AIDS patients

346
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,100
who are on disability.

347
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
- But voters right now
are gonna ask you,

348
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
okay, if you're gonna make more
money available for that,

349
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
what are you gonna cut?

350
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,133
- Right.
- Oh, something gotta go?

351
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,700
- Yeah.

352
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,066
Like the wars.
- The war, yeah.

353
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,834
Politics, for real, for real.

354
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,300
This is not easy.

355
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,433
- Now, it's important
that you get your message across

356
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,800
and that you're not vague.

357
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,100
It has to be direct.
- Right.

358
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,633
- All right, Latrice,
we're gonna let you

359
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,066
get back to your campaign,
all right?

360
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,567
- Thank you.
- Break a lash.

361
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,633
- I will.

362
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,934
- Hi, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Ru.

363
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,600
- You're running for president?
- I am.

364
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,934
- What's your slogan?

365
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,667
- Um, "you can always Kiki
with your girl Phi Phi."

366
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,900
- You're offering to have sex
with all Americans?

367
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,400
- [laughs]

368
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,567
- Not Kai-Kai.

369
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,700
- Oh, okay, I'm confused.

370
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,133
- Kiki, yeah.

371
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,233
- Kiki means, like, you know,
like, we gossip with each other.

372
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,633
- Oh, okay.

373
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,300
- It rhymes with my name,
and it's easy to remember.

374
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,266
- But it's easy to
misunderstand, like I did.

375
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:16,367
So you might want to have
a couple of alternates.

376
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,934
- So what is your platform?

377
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,333
- Make America pretty.

378
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,467
You know, build warehouses, so
that way a bunch of drag queens

379
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,200
can make designer
human hair wigs.

380
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,567
- So you're providing jobs
or you're providing wigs?

381
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,767
- Both.

382
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,567
- Okay, so it's socialism
for drag queens, then.

383
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,266
The government
will give you your wig.

384
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,533
- Yeah. 

385
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm gonna be
the drag president, so...

386
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,433
- Listen, you have
to make it something

387
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,633
that really speaks
to every American.

388
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,934
You have to be really direct.

389
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,700
I'm gonna let you
get back to work, okay?

390
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,133
All right, thanks, Phi Phi.

391
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,600
Hi, Dida.
- Hi, Ru.

392
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,066
- You doing your homework?
- I'm trying.

393
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,900
- Now, it's important to know
what you stand for.

394
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
What is your platform?

395
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,200
My platform is really about--

396
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,834
for like, queens
who are kind of underpaid.

397
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,133
We are stars too,
and this is a job,

398
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:01,300
and it deserves the same respect
as any normal performer.

399
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,133
- Why should someone
who's not a drag queen

400
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,467
vote for you for president?

401
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,834
- That I haven't come up with.

402
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,200
I still have
some thinking to do.

403
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,066
- Do you vote, personally?
- I do, I do, I vote.

404
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,200
I just--politics
is kind of something

405
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,667
that's hard for me to discuss
because it can get personal.

406
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,200
It can get very ugly,
and I hate that, so--

407
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
- Which is why it's important
for us to pay attention,

408
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,500
because politicians are gonna
demonize sexual minorities.

409
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
And if they can count on us
checking out,

410
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,066
they're likelier to win
and then get into office,

411
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,367
where they can really
do us harm.

412
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,433
- Right.

413
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,367
Well, you just read me.
I'm not gonna lie.

414
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,533
- Just make sure that it really
comes from the heart.

415
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,834
- Okay.
- Good luck.

416
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,800
- He lit my complete
campaign on fire.

417
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,133
That's what Dan Savage did.

418
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,500
I feel fucked.

419
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,433
- Candidate Chad Michaels.

420
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,467
- Hey, RuPaul.

421
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,834
- I want to hear
all about the campaign.

422
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,500
- Well, I'm just gonna have
some fun, Ru.

423
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,300
- Yes?
- So I'm creating a crazy lady.

424
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,567
- Oh, boy.

425
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,700
- For my campaign, and her name
is Lady Pimp Michaels.

426
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,633
- So what are your
campaign slogans?

427
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,967
- My issues are mandatory rhythm
and funk lessons

428
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,266
for all school kids,

429
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,500
because we've really lost
the beat in this country.

430
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,200
- Are there any real issues
you want to inject?

431
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,433
Do you have a real issue?

432
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:07,600
- I haven't really put
any real issues into this.

433
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,433
'Cause I want to make this fun.

434
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:12,400
- Make sure the constituency
can relate to you.

435
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,700
- I get you.

436
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,433
- Which is gonna be a problem
if that's your outfit.

437
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,967
- That's a pantsuit.
What are you talking about?

438
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,200
- All right, thanks, Chad.
- Bye, guys.

439
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,834
- Sharon Needles,
the first drag president.

440
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,734
What campaign slogans
have you written?

441
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,934
- Um, some of my campaign
slogans are,

442
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,166
"America's government
needs a sex change."

443
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,166
- Well, what does that mean?

444
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,433
- Well, it means, you know,

445
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,800
that it's time that, you know,

446
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,567
not just a man or a woman
is in office, but a man-woman--

447
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,066
- Oh.
- You know, is in the office.

448
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,834
Someone who can play
both fields.

449
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,100
- Now, are you planning
any negative campaigning?

450
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,133
- I'm not going to create
negative attack ad campaigns

451
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,533
because I was bullied
my entire childhood,

452
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,834
and that's just not
the platform I'm going to be,

453
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:52,834
uh, working with.

454
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,200
I want to talk to the people.

455
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,166
- But everybody says that
till they're down in the polls.

456
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,800
- Well, I enjoy being down
on a poll, so...

457
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,867
I mean, that's just something
I can handle, I think.

458
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,066
- Okay, good for you.

459
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,834
- I know you have
a lot of work to do,

460
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,400
so I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

461
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,967
See you at the debate.
- Uh-huh.

462
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,066
- All right.

463
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,734
All right, ladies.

464
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,834
Remember, these are tough times.

465
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:16,500
And the future of this great
nation depends on you.

466
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,834
So don't fuck it up.

467
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,233
Let's go.

468
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,100
- Good evening, and welcome
to "Frock the Vote" 2012.

469
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,633
Give us 22 minutes,

470
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:32,900
and we'll give you an erection
for the election.

471
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,400
I am your moderator, RuPaul.

472
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,333
And I'm here
with my esteemed colleagues

473
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,800
Michelle Visage and Dan Savage.

474
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,367
Welcome, candidates.

475
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,066
Tonight your answers
will be timed.

476
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,734
The yellow light
is a ten-second warning.

477
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:52,433
The red light
means your time is up.

478
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,934
If you go over,

479
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:58,166
the secret service is here
to escort you from the building.

480
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,367
Let's kick things off
with opening statements.

481
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,734
Chad Michaels.

482
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,433
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

483
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:06,233
My name is Chad
the Lady Pimp Michaels.

484
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,433
I am from California,

485
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,567
more specifically
the Shady Acres trailer park

486
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,066
on Doheny between
Weho and Beverly hills.

487
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,200
You might also remember me
as one of the first

488
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
transgendered dancers
on the<i> Soul Train.</i>

489
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,533
How you doin'?
[buzzer sounds]

490
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,667
What I plan to do is--
- Time is up, miss Michaels.

491
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,133
- The red light?
Shoes.

492
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,967
- Dida Ritz, same question.

493
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,066
- I am here,
and my name is Dida Ritz.

494
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,066
I'm here representing--or
running for wig party candidate.

495
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:32,233
And I'm here to talk
about the big "C" word today.

496
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,166
Change.

497
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,667
Change for the Ritz.

498
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,233
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

499
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,066
- Howdy, y'all.

500
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm just a small
southern girl from Texas.

501
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,800
You can see me
on the bestseller's list,

502
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,967
<i>Vote for Phi Phi.</i>

503
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,066
I just want everybody to know

504
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,300
that you can always Kiki

505
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,133
with your girl Phi Phi.

506
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,567
- Sharon Needles.

507
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,467
- Ladies and gentlemen
and everyone in between,

508
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,867
my name is Sharon Needles.

509
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,133
For a long time,

510
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,967
this government has been
in dire need of a sex change,

511
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,266
and I'm just the drag queen
to perform that operation.

512
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm Sharon Needles,

513
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,767
for sharing responsibilities.

514
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,066
- Latrice Royale.

515
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:07,734
- Good evening.
I am Latrice Royale.

516
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,066
Large and in charge,

517
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,100
chunky yet funky.

518
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,066
My fellow Americans,

519
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,567
everyone needs peace
with Latrice.

520
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,133
- All right, candidates.

521
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,734
The first question of the
evening from Dan Savage.

522
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,567
- Miss O'Hara, what experiences
from your past

523
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,667
make you the best candidate

524
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,900
to be America's first
drag president?

525
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,834
- Well, I have
lots of friends already,

526
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,133
like, in the government thing.

527
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,600
Ooh, like Sarah Palin.

528
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,467
And--and, like, when we used to
play "Spot That Russian!"

529
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,367
across the room,
like, my backyard or--

530
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,667
or when I was in Texas, we used
to go cow-tipping in drag.

531
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,400
- Oh.
[inaudible]

532
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,700
I'm scared for her.

533
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
- Yee-ha.

534
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,734
- Miss Royale?

535
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,567
- Coming from hum--
humble beginnings,

536
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,500
I was raised as a poor
black child in Compton.

537
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,233
I know what hard work,

538
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:54,367
dedication,
and perseverance means.

539
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:59,700
- All right, our next question,
from Michelle Visage.

540
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,200
- Miss Michaels,
as the first drag president,

541
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
how would you
redecorate the White House?

542
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,166
- I'm gonna paint
that bitch pink,

543
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,066
and I'm gonna fit the capitol
with an up-do.

544
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,300
Up...do.

545
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,400
Green light, look.

546
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,734
Yellow.

547
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,333
Bam, red.
[buzzer sounds]

548
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,500
- Chad has this, like,
master pimp thing going on.

549
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,567
I don't understand,
like, his storyline.

550
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,800
I mean, in a debate,
what is he debating about?

551
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,934
- [smacks lips]

552
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:26,533
- Dida Ritz.

553
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,066
- Well, first, I see everything
being Ralph Lauren.

554
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,934
I'm a big fan of Ralph Lauren
furniture,

555
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:33,066
Ralph Lauren paint,
Ralph Lauren rugs.

556
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,066
The drapery, Ralph Lauren.

557
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,467
- Girl, really?

558
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,934
- I would love
Ralph Lauren everything.

559
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,166
Thank you.

560
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,433
- Miss O'Hara.
- Hi.

561
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,633
- If you won the wig party
nomination,

562
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,667
which one of these queens

563
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,400
would you choose
as your running mate, and why?

564
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,133
- Well, being this time period,

565
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,567
I think it's so great

566
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,066
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.

567
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,934
So I'd definitely like
to say my help, Dida Ritz,

568
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:02,467
and the other help I had,
Latrice Royale.

569
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,567
[laughs brightly]
Yee-ha.

570
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,567
- Did she just call me
"the help"?

571
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,100
I don't even do windows.

572
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,400
- I'm from Compton, bitch.

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,266
I'll whip yo' ass.

574
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:17,100
- Miss Ritz, should drag queens
be allowed to marry?

575
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,233
- I truly believe drag queens

576
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,467
should be allowed
to get married,

577
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,633
whether a drag queen
wants to marry a drag queen

578
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,400
or a drag queen
wants to marry a dog.

579
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Change for the Ritz.

580
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,367
- Sharon Needles.

581
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,200
- Drag queens should most
definitely

582
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,367
be able to get married.

583
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,133
They should also have the right
to get divorced.

584
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,233
I too would like to be
an unhappy married woman

585
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,700
and then receive
my alimony checks

586
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,400
to pay for my young lovers
and vacations.

587
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,633
Thank you, Dan.

588
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,133
- Our next question
from Michelle Visage.

589
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,734
- Miss Michaels,

590
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:54,300
How would you explain
why drag is important

591
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,467
to voters who aren't
familiar with drag?

592
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,533
- Me being the first
transgendered<i> Soul Train</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dancer,</i>

593
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,133
we need to get back
to basic family values.

594
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,633
We've forgotten all of our
pertinent dance moves.

595
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,100
We got to get back
to the sprinkler.

596
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,166
All right?

597
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,266
We got to get back
to the running man.

598
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh, wait--
- That was the Roger Rabbit.

599
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,133
- That's the Roger Rabbit.
- Yeah.

600
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,633
- Look, I don't got nothing
to say about it,

601
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:16,066
I just--we did what we had to do
to, you know, to get by.

602
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,066
Look, yellow...

603
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,667
red.

604
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,800
- Miss Ritz,

605
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,100
unemployment is up,

606
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,367
higher than it's
ever been before.

607
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,834
How do you plan to put
more drag queens to work?

608
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,633
- Basically, to give them
more opportunities

609
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,533
to do what they love to do
by performing.

610
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:36,100
And no more of this $75 or $100
of bookings.

611
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,066
Queens deserve coins.

612
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,133
Drag costs montey.

613
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,367
It costs money to look,
well, this beautiful.

614
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,500
Thank you.

615
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,133
- Miss Royale,
politics can get so ugly.

616
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:50,200
Can you give us an example
of a time when you made peace

617
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,867
with someone you didn't
see eye to eye with?

618
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,967
- About five minutes ago.

619
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,066
I looked across at Miss O'Hara

620
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,900
and realized that she was ugly.

621
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,867
- Oh.

622
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,400
- And I'm at peace with that.

623
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,767
- [snickers]
- [laughing quietly]

624
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,133
- Miss O'Hara.
- Oh, howdy.

625
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,367
- How do you represent
the future of drag

626
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,834
in the U.S. of "Heyyy!"

627
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:14,700
- Well, first,
it's U.S. of "How-day!"

628
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
[laughs]

629
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,233
So I'm representing all, like,
the little southern girls

630
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,967
that like to warsh our drag,
like,

631
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,400
and hang 'em up to dry.

632
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Oh, and then when we get,
like, our jewelry

633
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,066
and we like to polish rocks
and make beautiful jewelry

634
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,600
'cause remember, if you ain't
got that bling bling,

635
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,867
you probably didn't get it
from Phi Phi.

636
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:31,900
[laughs]

637
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,767
♪ Ah! ♪

638
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,433
- You okay?
- Oh, I'm doing line dancing.

639
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,367
- All right, it's time to hear

640
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,700
the candidates'
closing statements.

641
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,467
Let's begin
with Miss Chad Michaels.

642
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,700
- At the end of the day,

643
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,066
I just want, you know,

644
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,367
to put someone down in my chair,

645
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,066
give them a good,
good scalp massage,

646
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,133
send them out,

647
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,266
and make them feel
like an American citizen.

648
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:57,400
Look, yellow.

649
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,767
One more time.

650
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,467
Red.

651
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,867
Those freaking lights.

652
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,633
Yellow, red.

653
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,834
- Miss Dida Ritz.

654
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:09,066
- I must say that I have a lot.

655
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,800
I have a lot
that I want to change.

656
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,734
Change for Ritz.

657
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,867
That's my slogan.
Thank you.

658
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:21,333
- Dida is coming off--like, her
answers are very "who cares?"

659
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,233
There's no passion,
no fire, no nothing.

660
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,667
- Latrice Royale.

661
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,900
- With my plans in effect,

662
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,066
we can look forward
to a fun-loving America,

663
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,800
an America where everyone
could be queen for a day.

664
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Thank you.

665
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,967
- Candidate Sharon Needles.

666
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,600
- Ladies and gentlemen,

667
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm not a ivy-league,
good old ladyboy.

668
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm just a girl of the streets.

669
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,700
And that's where I learned
the American people.

670
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,600
From the dark black soil of Iowa

671
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,633
to the punk rockers
of Colorado...

<i>[My Country 'Tis of Thee</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>

673
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,400
To the hippies of southern
California

674
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
to the blue-collar boys
of Pittsburgh,

675
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,367
I've walked in every single one
of their shoes.

676
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:06,867
I am of the people

for a better world.

00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,667
- Miss Phi Phi O'Hara.

681
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,734
This evening,
you get the last word.

682
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:19,500
- I wanna live in a world
that--vote for Phi Phi--

683
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,100
that--that, you know,
hos can be pimps finally and--

684
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,133

685
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,266

where, you know,
Jesus loves you.

688
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,066
And I didn't have a big enough
heart to cover you.

689
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,200
But I just want to say, America,

690
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
don't be a drag.

691
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Yeah.

692
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,533
Oh, I mean be a drag.

693
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:37,533
Ha, ha, ha!

694
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,600
Howdy.

695
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
I won.

696
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,533
- I did find Phi Phi
annoying tonight.

697
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,533
You gotta know when to quit.

00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,233
- Thank you, candidates.

701
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:54,367
That concludes our
"Frock the Vote" debate.

702
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,300
Remember to come early
on election day.

703
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,700
Oh, and don't forget to vote.

704
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,233
Good night, everybody.

705
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,133
- Walk this way.
- Hoo!

706
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,133
- Another day,
another dead diva, honey.

707
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,600
- Yesterday we had
our presidential debate.

708
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,834
And today we have to get ready
for the inaugural ball.

709
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,300
- Don't politics seem

710
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,700
like a drag queen
dressing room nowadays?

711
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,300
- Basically.
It's mudslinging.

712
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,600
It's not cute.

713
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
- I mean, I know yesterday
was a drag competition,

714
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,934
but I kind of wish we
could've used it a little more

715
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,166
as a platform
to talk about things that,

716
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,066
you know, we really wish
we could see changed.

717
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,166
- But, you know what?

718
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,567
This is<i> Drag Race,</i>
and it's, like--

719
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,066
- I'm sorry.
That's how I feel like.

720
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,133
I'm not trying to cut you off,

721
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,533
but that is exactly
my frustration.

722
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,367
This is<i> Drag Race.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
This is not the news.

723
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:41,700
- It's always been my policy,

724
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,633
especially, like,
when I'm working at shows,

725
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,667
you don't mix drag and politics.

726
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,967
I'm out to entertain people
and make them feel good

727
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,200
and not to spread my political
beliefs at the gay bar.

728
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,934
- I mean, the reality
of the fact is,

729
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:58,166
is Dan Savage is a comedic
political and sex advice writer

730
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,934
who is now taking
responsibility in this world

731
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,533
to try and, you know,
make it better.

732
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,900
I didn't have a Dan Savage
when I was in high school,

733
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,567
and I got it bad.

734
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,734
- Dan Savage
and all he does for, you know,

735
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,934
as an advocate and all that,
it's--it's great.

736
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,467
That's not me...that's Dan.

737
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,867
- We are given an opportunity

738
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,800
that no other drag queen
is given,

739
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,667
and that's a platform
to actually talk about things--

740
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,500
- And I agree with that,
and when I had that platform

741
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,800
to be able to speak,
when I had--

742
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,333
- When I was a kid,
I didn't have a Dan Savage.

743
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,633
- I felt like he trashed me.

744
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,100
Coming in here that serious

745
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,934
about something that was
supposed to be drag-related

746
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:29,934
and fun at the same time,

747
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,900
mixing views
and important issues

748
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,066
that are going on in the world--

749
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,300
- Right.
- Calm down.

750
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,233
I'm not a really big
fan of politics

751
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,967
because of how ugly it can get.

752
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,900
It doesn't take all that
screaming and hollering

753
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,934
to change the world.

754
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,200
- Did you guys ever run
for anything in school?

755
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,600
- No, I didn't.

756
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,934
- I ran for student council.

757
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,367
- I never did
'cause I didn't want

758
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,967
to really draw
any attention to myself.

759
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,400
I just thought that I would get,
like, harassed more.

760
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,333
- I was the only kid in my
school that,

761
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,900
you know, would say
that I was gay, so...

762
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,767
- Right.
- And, like, I wasn't just gay.

763
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,967
I was, like, gay and weird.
- Right.

764
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,066
- And I got bullied bad,

765
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,233
and I never told my parents
about it.

766
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,867
- I would always tell
the school, and, like,

767
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,100
they would all say, you know,
"Ignore it. Ignore it."

768
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,400
- Kids bully
out of insecurities,

769
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,200
but teachers have
the responsibility to stand in

770
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,066
and help kids
that are getting it.

771
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,500
- I don't know
how things have changed

772
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,867
since I was in high school,

773
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:26,467
but teachers never really
stepped up to halt anything.

774
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,967
- Well, and as self-serving
as being a drag queen is,

775
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,367
it does feel nice to know that

776
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:33,333
just having this exposure that
we're having right now--

777
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:37,066
not to sound cliché, but if I
can just help one child--

778
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,166
- Oh, don't go there.
- Just one.

779
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,066
- [laughing]
- [dramatically] One child,

780
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,767
I've done my part.

My commander-in-queef,

How are you?

Dan Savage.

Now, is this election
totally leotarded, or what?

801
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,333
- There are some total leotards
running in this election,

802
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,066
but I think
we're gonna be all right.

our queens frocked the vote

804
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,767
in a heated presidential debate.

805
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:44,934
Tonight they're ready
to rock the runway,

806
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:47,233
dressed for the inaugural ball.

Gentlemen, start your engines,

and may the best woman win.

809
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,633
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

810
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,867
Call her miss Ross.

811
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,433
Her ballot box is stuffed.

I'm serving them fresh,

- [laughs]

818
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,133
- Dida Ritz.

819
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,200
In all black.

820
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,734

- Ooh, is that a read, Dan?

829
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,867

- Very Marcus Bachmann.

- Ooh.
- In his dreams.

833
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:46,333
- Yes, in his dreams.
- [laughs]

834
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,233
- I feel like
that Republican lady

835
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,100
that the politician
can take to the ball,

836
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,767
but then take her back home
and she's a whore in bed.

837
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:57,066
- Very Republican lady.
"Gorge" Bush.

838
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,300

843
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,633
- You ain't ever
seen a president

844
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,667
look this sexy in your life.

845
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:13,633
I am throwing it, baby.

846
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:17,834
I want you to see all this shape
in its full glory.

847
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:20,200

a war chest.

- She went that-a-way.

850
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:25,600
President Sharon Needles.

851
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,033
- Take me to your leader.

852
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,433
- Yes.
- [laughs]

853
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,000
That's what the Bush twins
wanted to wear

854
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,100
to the inaugural ball.

855
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,200
- I am serving
transparency realness

856
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,033
with a gown made
out of pantyhose

857
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:40,700
and hair
that hits the debt ceiling.

858
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,433
- I can see
right through her candidacy.

859
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,600
- Yes.

860
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,066
That dress shows off
her stimulus package.

861
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,266
- Welcome, ladies.

862
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,633
We've all watched your debate.

863
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:59,567
Now it's time for some political
analysis from our judges.

864
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,600
Let's start with Phi Phi O'Hara.

865
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,900
Tell us about
your inaugural gown.

866
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,400
- Well, I decided to wear white.

867
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,633
It's fun. It's elegant.

868
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:11,066
- Or was it just trying
to court the white people?

869
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,834
- [chuckles]

870
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,700
- Or the help?
- Ooh.

871
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,066
- I think it's so great

872
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,233
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.

873
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,500
- I am clearly all about
political incorrectness,

874
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,867
but in order to land an
off-color joke,

875
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:32,533
it has to be funny, and that
joke came across as offensive.

876
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:36,066
And being a black woman,
I got a little offended.

877
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,166
- [laughs]

878
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,467
- People shouldn't get upset.

879
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:41,166
It's a joke,
'cause that's not me. Like--

880
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,967
- I thought your conservative,
Palinesque character

881
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:45,166
was really funny,

882
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,066
and I thought you did
a really great job.

883
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:50,066
You could have even taken it
further for my liking.

884
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,734
- But we all have to be
in on the joke.

885
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:52,834
It's the fart in church.

886
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,333
Not everyone
thinks that's funny.

887
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,066
It sometimes stinks.

888
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,200
- All right.

889
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,667
Next up, Dida Ritz.

890
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,934
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.

891
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,934
There was a lot of word salad
going on.

892
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,867
Just a bunch of words tossed up
into the air,

893
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,400
and it wasn't Tina Fey,
Sarah Palin hilarious.

894
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,467
It was just a little mystifying.

895
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,200
- Well, I tried
as hard as I could.

896
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,667
When questions were being asked
to me,

897
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,600
it was just kind of like
a deer in headlights moment.

898
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,834
It kind of makes me
uncomfortable,

899
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,133
to be honest with you.

900
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,900
- It may be uncomfortable
to talk politics, certainly,

901
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,066
but remember,
you're in the running

902
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,500
for America's next
drag superstar.

903
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,100
You exude beauty,

904
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,133
but we also want to know
that you're smart.

905
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,533
- Next up, Chad Michaels.

906
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,900
Hi, Chad.
- Hi, RuPaul.

907
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,633
- Tell me about the debate.

908
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,734
- This challenge
was intimidating to me.

909
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:36,066
Heavy debate and politics
are not my forte,

910
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,567
but I didn't come here
not to rise to the occasion,

911
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:40,834
so I created
the lady pimp character.

912
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,533
- I loved you in the debate,

913
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,066
and I loved your character.

914
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:47,700
Every four years,
there are joke candidates.

915
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,600
Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann.
- [laughs]

916
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,066
- And you were
sending those guys up.

917
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,467
You were just stellar.

918
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,367
- You're the only queen tonight

919
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:59,200
that really looks like you're
going to the inauguration.

920
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,467
- I see Mamie Eisenhower
up there,

921
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:04,633
and it hearkens back to a time

922
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,633
when the economy
wasn't in the fucking toilet.

923
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:07,834
- [laughs]

924
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:11,433
All right, let's move on
to Miss Latrice Royale.

925
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:12,467
- Hi, Ru.

926
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,633
- What was your platform
and slogan?

927
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:19,066
- My slogan was, "Everyone
needs peace with Latrice."

928
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,734
And I had a couple of issues,

929
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:23,767
such as medication
and more funding

930
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,533
for HIV and AIDS patients.

931
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,166
- Did you say that
in the debate?

932
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,967
- I didn't get a chance
to bring it up.

933
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,633
- You say you didn't get
a chance to bring it up,

934
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,166
but there were actually
several opportunities

935
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,066
where the light
hadn't gone off yet,

936
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,166
so you had chances,

937
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,200
but they slipped
through your fingers somehow.

938
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
- Right.

939
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:43,567
- Right now, it looks more like
you're going to an awards show

940
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,500
rather than an inauguration.

941
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,667
It doesn't look expensive
or luxurious,

942
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,166
and, um, is that
your bra strap coming out--

943
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,633
- Right here?
- On this side?

944
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,934
- It made my titty look funny
if I pushed it down.

945
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,166
I can put it away for you.

946
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,400
- Girl, do not wear your bra
sticking out of a gown.

947
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,133
[imitates slap]
- Okay.

948
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,700
- It's better.
- All right.

949
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,400
Up next, Sharon Needles.

950
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,433
So tell me about
your inaugural gown.

951
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,200
- It's, uh,
it's a little futuristic

952
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,500
because, let's be honest,

953
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,100
a drag queen's not gonna be
president for 100 years,

954
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,266
so I had to think ahead.

955
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:18,433
- [laughs]
- It works. It all works.

956
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,734
The proportions work,

957
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,066
and the nude and the black,

958
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,667
and especially with the hair
you have tonight,

959
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,433
you hit the nail on the head.

960
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,700
- As far as your debate goes,

961
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,100
I just got that you were a woman
there who meant business

962
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,400
and you wanted to be heard.

963
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,233
I thought you got the message
across hilariously.

964
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:38,533
- I'll be honest, I got scared
as hell when you came out

965
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:39,533
on the runway tonight.

966
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,867
It was good and bad for me.

967
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,133
- Sharon Needles, is there
anything you'd like to say.

968
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:46,734
- Um, I love vodka, and, um--
[laughter]

969
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:50,133
I have responsibly enjoyed your
company many a night.

970
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,100
[laughter]

971
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,433
- Thank you, ladies.

972
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:54,867
I think we've heard enough.

973
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,400
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

974
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,867
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,

975
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,066
the judges and I will
deliberate.

976
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,266
[engine starting sound effect]

977
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,266
All right.

978
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,633
Just between us girls,

979
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:07,834
let's caucus,

980
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,166
starting with Phi Phi O'Hara.

981
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,066
- Phi Phi committed
to the Palinesque character.

982
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,934
Even if one or two of her jokes
fell flat,

983
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,900
I still thought
it was believable.

984
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,066
- I have respect for people

985
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,400
who should be committed
and are committed.

986
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,100
[laughter]
But it kind of flopped.

987
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,433
It didn't really hit the jokes.

988
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,467
So, for me, it misses the mark.

989
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,767
- All right...Dida Ritz.

990
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,834
Well, she said she was
intimidated by this challenge.

991
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,600
- But you have to go
out on a limb sometimes,

992
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,433
and you have to step
out of your comfort zone.

993
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:34,767
I mean, this is a competition.

994
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,667
- She's a beautiful queen.
- Beautiful.

995
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,500
- But there's always
something off about Dida.

996
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,066
She'll get the hair right
and the makeup right,

997
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,333
and then the body's off.

998
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,367
She'll get the body right,

999
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,567
and then the hair's like, what?

1000
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,200
- Now, Michelle, any cons?

1001
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,700
[laughter]

1002
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
- I think she's fierce.

1003
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,500
- No, she is, absolutely.
That's why she's here.

1004
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,233
- Is she taking advantage
of being here?

1005
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,533
Like, is she gonna take some
feedback and make some changes,

1006
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,767
or just react defensively?

1007
00:35:56,767 --> 00:36:00,400
- Let's move on down the line
to Chad Michaels.

1008
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,066
- I loved Chad
during the debate.

1009
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,800
It wasn't just
this one-note character,

1010
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,967
kind of like Phi Phi had.

1011
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,133
Chad had a fully-realized
human being.

1012
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,967
- And she was going
for yet another character.

1013
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,834
I love a chameleon,
but we've seen a lot already,

1014
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:16,967
and I'd love just a glimpse of
who the real Chad Michaels is.

1015
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,300
- All right.
Latrice Royale.

1016
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,934
- She didn't have a character.

1017
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:23,600
She started strong,
and I was really in it with her,

1018
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,066
and then I think
she lost her way.

1019
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,567
- And why do we
have to tell somebody

1020
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:27,834
to tuck their bra in their dre--

1021
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,667
like, this is top five, people.

1022
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,066
But they shouldn't be making
these mistakes at this point.

1023
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,300
- That's true.

1024
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,066
- But in the debate,
she was an imposing presence,

1025
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:37,233
uh, and people look for that
in a president.

1026
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,400
She had gravitas.

1027
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
- There's an ointment
that will clear that up.

1028
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,266
[laughter]

1029
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,500
Sharon Needles.

1030
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,934
- I love her aesthetic
and I love her sense of humor,

1031
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,333
and I thought
it was really effective.

1032
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,300
We're all here,
pretending that a drag queen

1033
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
could get elected president,

1034
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
and she walked out there
and said, "Not for 100 years."

1035
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,066
- [laughs]
- And she's right.

1036
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,300
- But you have to remember,

1037
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,166
if you're gonna be America's
next drag superstar,

1038
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,266
you don't want to do
shock value all the time.

1039
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,900
- All right.

1040
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,500
Silence!

1041
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,834
Bring back...my girls.

1042
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,200
Welcome back, ladies.

1043
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
The votes have been tallied.

1044
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Chad Michaels,

1045
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,867
you created
a candidate with character,

1046
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:22,834
and you took the wig party
back to its roots.

1047
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,834
You're safe.

1048
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,400
- Thanks, guys.

1049
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:36,600
- Sharon Needles, you took your
campaign to hell and back

1050
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,600
and gave us much more
than politics as usual.

1051
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,533
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge...

1052
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,533
[applause]

1053
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:50,066
And you've won a $5,000

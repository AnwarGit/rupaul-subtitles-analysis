Oh, my gosh, Manila, in the
beginning, you were so annoying.

91
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,367
- I didn't realize how annoying
you were until midway,

92
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,600

Actually, Raja, I'm really happy
that I got to meet you,

because you've been doing it
for so long,

like, you can still do it

Who's got the style?
Who's got the grace?

Who's got the balls
to take my place?

Now, if more is more,
then bigger is badder.

- Hi!

146
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,900
- When I first saw Ryan,
I said...

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,567
- Today we're gonna work on some
choreography

148
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,867
for RuPaul's new song,<i> Champion.</i>

149
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,767
So let's really try to take it
out on this contemporary mode.

150
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,333
It's about being
a statuesque goddess.

151
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,300
Raja, can I have you take
this box here?

152
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,500
- I'm a little nervous,
because I am a runway girl,

153
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,467
and I don't know about dancing.

154
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,900
That's not my thing.

155
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,233
- You are statues,

156
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,200
but you are gonna morph
into different positions, okay?

157
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,767
So I want to see you guys
hit poses

158
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:12,967
every four counts.

159
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,734
One, two, three, four,
and then morph.

160
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,233
One, two, three, four.

161
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,333
Hold one, two, three, four.

162
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,800
Pose, one, two, three, four.
Okay?

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,266
Here we go.

164
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,667
Five, six, seven, eight.

165
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,367
And hah, two, three, four.

166
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,533
And switch, six, seven, eight.

167
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,500
Hold one, two, three, four.

168
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,166
- Whoo!
I'm gonna fall off the box.

169
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,900
- Raja, let's try to be more...

170
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,333
hieroglyphic,
beautiful statues, yes?

171
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,467
Again, five, six, seven, eight.

172
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,133
And switch.
- Oh.

173
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,967
- Manila, make it a little bit
more grand.

174
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:51,533
You are a statue.
They've carved you out of stone.

175
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,767
This is not gonna get it.

176
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,567
Now cross over.
Go!

177
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,467
Bah bah bah bah bah.

178
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,166
Bah bah ah-bah bah bah.

179
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,100
And through.
And through.

180
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,266
And through.
And off camera, yes.

181
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,533
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,233
Alexis, her poses are amazing.

183
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,066
She knows how to portray
the character I'm asking for,

184
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,967
and it's instant with her.

185
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,734
The other two girls are really
gonna have to pull up

186
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,066
to match her.

187
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,700
- Hi, Ru.

188
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,066
- Darling!
Have a seat.

189
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,734
- Walking towards Ru
to have my lunch with him

190
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,500
is nerve-wracking.

191
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,433
It's a moment that could define
the whole competition.

192
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,934
- I've taken the liberty
to fix you a plate.

193
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:31,133
- I'm on a diet.
- Just have half of one.

194
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,734
- [laughing]

195
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,100
- Who is rooting for you
back home?

196
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,633
- Well, my family's rooting
for me.

197
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,734
[tearfully] I am so blessed.

198
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:42,867
When I walk in my house,

199
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:49,100
I can be myself with my mom,
with my sister...

200
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,967
with my friends.

201
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,767
And it's completely strange
that people

202
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,800
that I met in United States
that, like,

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,066
they always keep me going.

204
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:03,100
- So they're an extended family
that you've created in America.

205
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,333
I'm sure that they're<i> very</i><span style="bodyStyle"> proud</i>
of you.

206
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,700
Now that there are three,
what is your strategy?

207
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,533
- Well, I just gonna be myself.

208
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,600
And I am very sure
that I am perfect,

209
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,467
so it doesn't matter
what happens in the competition.

210
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,533
I know I'm a star.

211
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,433
- You already are a star.

212
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,066
Well, we had lunch,
and you didn't touch a thing.

213
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,066
- [laughs]

214
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,300
I told you I was in a diet.

215
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,800
I want to work on my body
so Michelle likes it.

216
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
- [laughs]

217
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,233
All right, darling.

218
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,567
You just keep on flying.

219
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,800
- Thank you for lunch.

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,834
The bill's on you.

221
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:34,967
- [laughs]

222
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,934
- Bye, Ru.

223
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,734
- Hi.

224
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,767
- Now it's time for us to
rehearse the part of the routine

225
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,667
where we get to use a pit crew
member as a prop.

226
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,233
- It should look like you've
known each other forever.

227
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,266
Actually, no.

228
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,066
You've known each other
for two nights.

229
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:54,633
It's always a little bit more
heated after...that point.

230
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes. Mm.

231
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,667
Now peeking over
the shoulder.

232
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,667
And in that moment...

233
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,700
ah, we missed that moment.

234
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,800
Come back.

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,066
Yes, now get intimate and
closer.

236
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,066
Ah, and down, down, down, down,

237
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,600
down, down, up.

238
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,266
- Ta-da! No?

239
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,233
- Do you have a fear of
intimacy?

240
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,333
- Little bit.

241
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,767
I'm having the hardest time
focusing.

242
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,934
And I understand
where it's coming from.

243
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,700
He is probably seeing me
holding back,

244
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,433
because I fucked up a lot
in my life.

245
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,233
I want to win this contest.

246
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,567
And I really do not want
to fuck this up.

247
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,300
- It's about the intimacy
between you two,

248
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,433
and I think if
it's a little bit more true,

249
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,867
it'll read true on camera.

250
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,900
- Okay.
- Okay?

251
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,066
Raja really needs to let
her guard down.

252
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,333
I think that's what she's gonna
have to break through

253
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,900
in order to make this part
of the video work.

254
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,767
- Well, hello there!
Have a seat.

255
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:50,834
- Oh, thank you.

256
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,967
- What's been the hardest part
for you?

257
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,367
- Being away from my family,
not being able to call.

258
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,567
Hopefully,
they'll be proud of me,

259
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,166
because this is my medium.

260
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,200
- You're saying hopefully
they'll be proud of you.

261
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,266
Is there a chance that they
won't be proud of you?

262
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,633
- You know, it's a part of me

263
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:08,567
that my father really doesn't
like to be a part of.

264
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,467
Ever since I was a little boy,
he tried playing catch with me,

265
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,233
and he said, "Oh, well, this is
not gonna work."

266
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,667
- [laughs]

267
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,934
What do you think it would take
for your father to come around?

268
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,900
- Part of it is me.

269
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,100
I feel like my dad's probably
willing to learn

270
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,300
and be part of my lifestyle
as a drag queen.

271
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
I came here hoping that I would
be successful at it,

272
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,834
and then I could come back
and be like,

273
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,400
"Dad, Dad, look what I did."

274
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,500
He'd be so proud of me, even if
it's not, like, the ideal thing

275
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,633
that he would want me to do.

276
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:39,266
- I want you to say to him
what you're feeling,

277
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:43,467
what you would want him to take
from your being on this show.

278
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,633
- Daddy...

279
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:52,867
um, I couldn't have been here
without you and Mom.

280
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,834
It feels nice to be blessed,

281
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:59,500
to have, um...

282
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,667
like, a supportive family,

283
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,533
'cause I know lots of people
don't.

284
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,967
- And you're one of
the lucky ones.

285
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,700
It would be great for your
father to be proud of you,

286
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,500
but the truth is, it's about you
being proud of yourself.

287
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,333
- Well, hello.

288
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,467
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Welcome.

289
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,500
- Now it's time to rehearse
the part of the video

290
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,633
when I gonna be joined
by the pit crew guy.

291
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,800
- So we are now gonna work

292
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,066
on the more intimate side
of the video.

293
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,800
- Can we take the clothes off?

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
- Whatever helps.

295
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,967
- Let's go.

296
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:37,767
- And rotating in...and...

297
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,533
Beautiful, yes, yes, yes.

298
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,266
Gorgeous. So from here...

299
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,834
I want you guys to improv.

300
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,266
- Oh, Jesus.

301
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:47,066
- But I don't want you to
separate.

302
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,867
A little closer.
Don't lean away.

303
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,934
Get into it.
Uh-huh. And...

304
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,500
[Alexis giggling]

305
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,133
No laughing.

306
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,400
Stay connected...

307
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,467
and work there for a moment,
improv.

308
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,767
[both laughing]

309
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,166
No laughing!

310
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,433
- It was very nerve-wracking

311
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,100
to have somebody
that you don't know

312
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,700
work with you as so close,

313
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,266
because it's a very intimate
moment.

314
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,633
- It's a simple...

315
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,467
- Touchy-touchy.
- Touchy.

316
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,600
You know, maybe it's here.

317
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Click.

318
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,066
Shabam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

319
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,533
Alexis has dance background.

320
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,233
However, when it comes
to turning off

321
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,767
that stage persona,

322
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,800
I think it's really hard
for Alexis to do that.

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Hopefully, she can just be
a little bit more in the moment.

324
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Even though I'm giving you
choreography,

325
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,934
it should not look like
choreography.

326
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,867
It should look like you guys
are in your bedroom,

327
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,934
on your satin sheets,
working it out.

328
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,233
- Hi, Ru.

329
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,533
- Well, hello, Raja.

330
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,700
- What is this, Thanksgiving?
- [laughs]

331
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,166
- I couldn't possibly.

332
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,166
- You're a bit of an introvert.

333
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,433
- Sometimes, yeah.

334
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,467
- When you're on the runway,
you own the room.

335
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:57,734
How does an introvert live
in the body of an extravert?

336
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,400
- [laughs]
- How does that work?

337
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,633
- Duality comes from me being
a Gemini, I think.

338
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,367
There's a whole other side of me

339
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,967
that's a complete ham and
exhibitionist,

340
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,900
and I really love
being in front of people.

341
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,567
- Who's rooting for you
at home?

342
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,400
- I'm really hoping
that my parents

343
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,066
are going to pay attention
and really see what I do,

344
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,600
maybe for the first time
in their lives.

345
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
- Wow.

346
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,667
- You know, they've been

347
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,066
in some of the great moments
in my life,

348
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,600
but never have they seen
how proud I am to do what I do.

349
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,066
This will be a really great way

350
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,066
for them to see how much life

all over the place,

Work all of that train, mama.

708
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,533

Sunday in the park with Alexis.

712
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,266
- Yes, she can-can.

713
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,867
- I pick my showgirl costume,

714
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:20,266
because it's the last time
that the judges is gonna see me,

715

that this is who I am.

Alexis Mateo

and the stage is mine.

718
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,433
- And she vajazzled her head.

719
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:32,066
- She brings her own shade to
the runway.

720
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,533
- Yes, she does.
- Yes, she does.

721
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,600
- Meet me in St. Louis.

722
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,100
Wow.

813
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:15,200

in the face.

815
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,734
I was like, "Manila, I think
you're annoying," and she said,

I think so too."

I think she's an amazing
performer.

831
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,800
As for cons,
the drag that she does,

832
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,166
I've seen it before,
and it doesn't excite me.

I love Raja.

834
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,900
She's very fashion,
but sometimes

835
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,467
it's, like, a little bit
too, like, editorial.

Those are my cons first.

837
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:10,300
Get those out of the way
so I can end on a high note.

838
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,734
I'm kind of crazy
and a little unpredictable,

839

at times.

I can do almost anything.

So...I can be me for myself and
please other people.

- Alexis is a very, very
talented performer.

843

Cons: I don't really think
she thinks outside of the box.

Her marabou and her rhinestones

845

to me.

846

It's always an entertaining
moment with Manila,

847
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,066
and I think that's awesome.

848
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,266
But Manila has a lot of growth
to do.

849
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,667
There's still a bit of
a template that she fits into.

850
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,266
I'm not really into templates.

851
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,734
- I want to ask you
about your pros and cons.

852
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,066

00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,734
- And Manila has won
the last two challenges.

876
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:45,700
- She did.

877
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,934
- She's on a roll.

878
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:49,367
So let's move on to Alexis.

879
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,233
- You know how many times
I've counted her out?

880
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,734
- Tell me, how many times have
you counted her out?

881
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:55,066
- At least three or four times.
And then bam!

882
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:58,967
- Her Florida style of drag has
been considered, by many people,

883
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:03,367
to be too regional to be
America's next drag superstar.

884
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,867
- I never counted her out.

885
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:09,834
She is so authentic in what
she's bringing to the table

886
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,667
that I give her a free pass
on the over-the-top cha-cha.

887
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,767
- Her conviction is flawless.

888
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,100
Yeah, it's just flawless.

889
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,633
Let's move on to Raja.

890
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,066
- Sometimes I feel like she's
only worried

891
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,533
about the runway aspect
of the challenge.

892
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:26,066
- The bitch is bad.

893
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:29,300
- But does she do anything else
besides high fashion?

894
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,166
- Well, she won
three challenges.

895
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,300
- Yeah, she did.

896
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
- And she doesn't take herself
too seriously.

897
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,066
The bucket of blood,
remember that?

898
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,300
- Yeah, the<i> Carrie</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing?</i>

899
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,433
- She takes genderfuck
and turns it into something

900
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:42,800
that's actually heightened and
intellectual and special.

901
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,533
- Her take on drag is very
different, very fresh and new.

902
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,734
- This is not going to be easy.

903
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,233
- All three of them are
superstars,

904
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,066
and they're all
equally as fierce.

905
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,200
- Silence!

906
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,500
This ain't over until they
lip-synch for their lives.

907
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,233
Bring back my girls.

908
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,433
Welcome back, ladies.

909
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,800
It all comes down to this.

Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me

932

America's next drag superstar.

933
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:46,367
- My heart has never beat
faster in my life.

934
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,567
I felt like it was gonna jump
out of my chest.

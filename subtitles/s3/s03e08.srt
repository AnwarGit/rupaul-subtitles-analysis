inspired by these cakes.

00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,767
Ooh!

5
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:12,667
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.

6
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,767
- The reality of it
is that she looked awful.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,700
- I would like
to see Shangela go.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,600
She's just a loudmouth,
and she's always halleluing.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,066
- Shangela, get the fuck out.

10
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,133
- Raja.

You're the winner
of this challenge.

Alexis Mateo,
you're a sweet talker,

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,300
but your cheesecake couture

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,667
struck a sour note
with the judges.

15
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,433
Shante, you stay.

16
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:41,467

Reading is fundamental.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,033
- Ow!

21
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,367
Eat it, eat it, eat it, ow.

22
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,467
- And a comedy of errors.

23
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,300
- I said,
"Bitch better have my money."

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300

guest judges

00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,967
It's so empty in here.

35
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,066
Hello.

Stacy Layne 'Bryant' Matthews."

41
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,967
- The last challenge,
being in the bottom two,

42
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,266
I think it was a fluke.

43
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,667
So right now
I just have to concentrate

44
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:05,467
in what the judges
are looking for.

45
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,967
- Well, Stacy's gone.

46
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,967
Now you're the only big girl.

47
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,800
- Stacy probably shouldn't have
been here to begin with.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
She didn't meet the criteria.

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,934
But now I have a whole other
can of worms to worry about.

50
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,400
For the most part, all the
strong competitors are here.

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,934
And it's really hammered in
that now

52
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,200
the competition is super tight.

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,066
At this point,
it's getting very personal.

54
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,300
- I wanted to ask you
about yesterday.

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
When you said you're so tired
of hearing my voice,

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,633
my reaction was,
like, I was shocked.

57
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:36,900
- It came off a lot harsher
than I intended.

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,800
- As I'm having this
conversation with Manila,

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,066
it's a complete 180

60
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,700
from what she was delivering
on the runway.

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,400
I know that Manila
has more faces

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
than my foot has blisters
after a show.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,166
- And I don't want you to think
that I'm attacking you...

64
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,734
- No.
- But I am attacking you.

65
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,633
Because ultimately
this is a competition,

66
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,934
and I want to beat you.

67
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:59,433
[alarm wails]
- Ooh, girl.

68
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,667
You've got shemail.

69
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,433
Hello, lady-boys.

70
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,834
- Hi.

71
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,100
- Drag is a serious business,

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,800
but sometimes a queen can take

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,734
herself a little too seriously.

74
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:13,166
Remember, laugh, and the world

75
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,300
laughs with you.

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,867
Bomb, and the joke's on you,
honey.

77
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,433
- Whoo!

78
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,900
Yeah.

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,500
- Hello, hello, hello.

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,200
- Hello.

81
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,734
- My legendary children.

82
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:30,834
A drag superstar needs to
develop a pretty thick skin.

83
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,066
So in the great tradition
of<i> Paris Is Burning,</i>

84
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:37,500
break out your library cards.

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,467
- Oh, god.

86
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,934
- Because reading is what?

87
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,066
Fundamental.

88
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:45,066
Now, for today's mini challenge,

89
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,633
you'll take turns
reading each other.

90
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,400
Or throwing shade.

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,867
Ladies, the library is open,
okay?

92
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,133
- Okay.

93
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,166
- Yara Sofia.

94

<i>La biblioteca</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is open.</i>

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,433
Put on your reading glasses

96
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,433
and read these bitches
for filth.

97
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,133
- Manila Luzon.

98
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,633
It's not because you're Asian.

99
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:13,667
It's because I need some
patience to deal with you.

100
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:17,900
Delta Work, is that your tits
or your feet?

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,233
- Oh!

102
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,700
- Raja,
you think you're fashion?

103
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,967
You should go to old...school.

104
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,066
- Next up, Manila.

105
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,700
- Ow, eat it, eat it, eat it.

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,734
Ow!

107
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,333
- Put on your reading glasses.

108
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,800
- Oh, god.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,066
- Ooh, Yara.

110
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,367
Your blue contacts are so creepy

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,967
that it makes my skin itchy,

112
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,066
itchy, itchy...pa'lante.

113
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,333
- Oh!

114
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,300
- It's dinner time, Delta.

115
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,967
And you are serving
body-ody-ody.

116
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,166
Well, I guess
that solves the problem

117
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,900
with all them starving kids
in Africa.

118
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,567
- Thank you, Manila.

119
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,200
Up next is Miss Delta.

120
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,166
- Oh, my gosh.

121
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,066
Yara, isn't it interesting

122
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,800
that when your flight
came into town

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,066
the sightings of chupacabras
increased?

124
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,066

125
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,834
Manila, what are we gonna do

126
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,967
when the hurricane
hits all of Asia.

127
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,900
You won't have
any material left.

128
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,166
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

129
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,066
- Raja,
when you're on the runway,

130
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,200
do you keep the 800 number
for suicide?

131
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
Because those toes
are ready to jump.

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,500
- Whoa!

133
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,133
- Bring your library card,
Miss Alexis Mateo.

134
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,433
- Get ready, bitches.

135
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:41,066
Miss Shangela, girl,
can we have some water?

136
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,133
Her hair is thirsty, baby.

137
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,066
- Uh-oh.

138
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,767
- Delta, just grow a neck,
honey.

139
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:47,900
- Whoa!

140
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,667
- All they can read is my size,

141
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,900
and that's so obvious.

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,867
Now tell me something funny.

143
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,567
- Raja, should I call you Raja
or grandma?

144
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,066
- Ooh!

145
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,967
- Oh!

146
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,400
- Raja, you are up.

147
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,066
- Shangela,
I hope you still have

148
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,333
your phone card to Middle-earth,

149
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,367
'cause the hobbits are calling.

150
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,433
- Ooh!

151
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,834
- Fat.

152
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,133
Who cares?

153
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,667
Syphilis.

[laughter]

155
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:28,066
- Carmen, the library
is open to you, my dear.

156
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,433
- Word.

157
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:36,066
- Yara, what the fuck are you
saying, girl?

158
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,166
- Alexis, girl, I been thinking

159
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,700
about you all day.

160
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,767
I was at the zoo.

161
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,567
- Ooh!

162
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,533
- All right, last but not least,
Shangela.

163
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,066
Yes.

164
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,700
- Oh.

165
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
Mimi Imfurst.

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,533
[laughter]

167
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:56,066
Raja, I know you call yourself
Top Model,

168
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,133
but I think Tyra Banks and I
would agree

169
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,166
you're just fashion roadkill.

170
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,834
- Ooh!

171
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:05,066
- Manila Luzon,
Asian role model.

172
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,734
Well, I hope you're referring to

173
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,734
the rolls all over your body.

174
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,066
- Ooh!

175
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,667
- And, aw, Carmen Carrera.

176
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,066
Honey, just go
jump in the ocean.

177
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,066
You won't drown.

Silicone floats.

179
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,066
- All right, girl.

180
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,200
The library
is permanently closed.

181
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,600
All right, ladies, good job.

182
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,500
But I think we have a winner.

183
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,400
Shangela!

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,100
For this week's main challenge,

185
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,633
you need to develop
a stand-up comedy routine.

186
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,667
To help you create
a winning routine,

187
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,166
you'll each take
a one-on-one comedy workshop

188
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,066
with legendary funny lady

189
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,667
Miss Rita Rudner.

190
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,767
- Oh, wow.

191
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,433
- Oh, my god, Rita!

192
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:05,367
I can't wait to meet
Rita Rudner!

193
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,266
- Now, for your
stand-up performance,

194
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,567
you'll need to put together

195
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,734
a funny outfit
worthy of a queen of comedy.

196
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:16,066
Gentlemen, start your engines,

197
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:21,066
and may the funniest bitch win.

198
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,066
- All right.

199
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,066
See y'all later.

200
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,934
- Oh, my.

201
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,166
Yes, I am a little terrified.

202
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,834
My heart stopped, actually,
when she said that.

203
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,133
It's frightening,

204
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,967
'cause I'm just hoping
that I don't bomb,

205
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,567
and that happens a lot
with comedians.

206
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,800
If you don't have
the perfect timing,

207
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,967
you could really fuck it up.

208
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,300
Shangela's an amazing comedian.

209
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,567
She's been doing it for a while,

210
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,633
so I'm sure she's gonna do
really well in this one.

211
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:42,700
- Well, damn sure I was right

212
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,967
when I said,
"I want that bitch to go."

213
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:52,133
- Well, no, because comedy
is hit or miss.

214
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,133
It's a lot of pressure.

215
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,900
- We all kind of
have to be good,

216
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,467
the three of us, because their
group's still the same size.

217
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,800
Our group is getting smaller.

218
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
- It's like our workroom
is now divided into two groups.

219
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,066
We got team talent
and team look.

220
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,667
Raja, Delta, Carmen, and Manila

221
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,300
all put the emphasis
on their look.

222
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,734
They can't perform.

223
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,467
- Today we have to do
a stand-up routine,

224
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,066
and we have to create
a drag look

225
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,100
that goes with
our stand-up routine.

226
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
- I'm gonna have to do some

227
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,867
brainstorming here.

228
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,066
- Well, that's gonna be hard.

229
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,100
You see what time she's having
with it.

230
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,934
The workroom today
is very quiet.

231
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,734
There's no sewing.

232
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,600
Everyone is digging
deep inside their brains,

233
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,867
trying to find
what about themselves is funny.

234
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,100
- I'm--I'm afraid.

235
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
- You can't be afraid.

236
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,367
You got to go in or go home.

237
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,433
- It's hard
to make people laugh,

238
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:47,934
but I'm gonna do it.

239
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,567
I'm so funny.

240
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,567
Funny enough
that you gonna laugh.

241
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,333
- A lot of people here
host a show,

242
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,533
so everyone here is gonna be
strong competition,

243
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,066
and that's, like,

244
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,734
when they tell me that
my makeup's not the best,

245
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,000
you know, it's important to me
to look--

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,066
have the look right.

247
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,567
When I get
in front of the judges,

248
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,967
it's never a question
about talent.

249
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,400
It's always something
regarding my makeup.

250
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,700
- The purpose for the makeup
is not to look...painted.

251
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,967
- What about when I'm doing here
and sculpting the face?

252
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,433
You know how you talk about
a round face?

253
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,900
- From here up, I don't use
a lot of foundation.

254
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,066
I don't need it there.

255
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,200
- Oh, it's not even
all the way across?

256
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,333
- No.
- No.

257
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,000
Because then you're
creating a mask.

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,033
Everything that Shangela said

259
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,767
is exactly
what you never should do.

260
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,834
- You don't put on powder
between steps?

261
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,667
- No! No!

262
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,700
[laughter]

263
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,734
How do you--no, no.

264
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,166
- Hello, funny ladies.

265
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,200
- Hi.

266
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
- Funny girls.

267
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,467
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.

268
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,900
- Now, you're obviously
from New Jersey.

269
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,600
You have sort of
a Jersey accent.

270
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,033
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

271
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,333
Are you gonna play up sort of

272
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,266
the stereotypical things
that people may think of you?

273
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,834
- No, I'm not typical Jersey.

274
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,066
So...

275
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,100
- How do you know you're not
typical Jersey?

276
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,333
- I don't think I am.

277
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,133
I don't see it.

278
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,233
Am I that Jersey?

279
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,233
Like, what does that mean?

280
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,734
I mean, is that an insult?

281
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:14,767
- A lot of comedy
comes from stereotypes,

282
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,900
and if you play on that,
it can be very funny.

283
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,266
People can relate to it.

284
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:22,133
Because, really, you want to
invite people into your world

285
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,600
and make them feel comfortable.

286
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,333
But it's up to you whether
you're willing to let us in.

287
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,166
- I don't really like
to let anyone in.

288
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,166
- Well, you got to
get over that.

289
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,300
Hey, Manila.

290
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,533
- Hi.

291
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,066
- You know, this seems like
a shoo-in for you.

292
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,867
You're very funny.

293
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,100
- I'm going back
to my childhood.

294
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,767
As an adult looking back,

295
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,133
how gay some of the things
I used to watch on TV were.

296
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,133
<i>Sesame Street?</i>

297
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,567
- Right, right.

298
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,166
So now, in the past,

299
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,500
I've heard jokes
about<i> Sesame Street.</i>

300
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,066
- Um, maybe.
I don't really know.

301
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:55,734
- I want to hear something
that we haven't heard before.

302
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,233
Get back to work.
- Thanks.

303
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,066
- See ya.

304
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,333
Hey, Alexis.

305
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,367
- Hi, Ru.

306
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,533
- Have you done comedy before?

307
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,467
- No, we have never
do stand-up comedy.

308
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,433
- I see.

309
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,867
And you're gonna tell
some jokes?

310
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,900
- Yes.

311
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,066
- As Alexis, or as a character?

312
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,133
- As Alexis Mateo.

313
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,133
And it's gonna talk about

314
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,567
my coming to America experience.

315
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,567
It was a big change.

316
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,734
It was the problem
with the language.

317
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,567
- No one else
has your life experience,

318
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,333
so if you draw on that,

319
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,834
how could you go wrong?

320
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:25,233
Especially if you can
laugh at yourself.

321
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,967
- I love making fun of myself.

322
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,066
- I am so excited.

323
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,133
I can't wait to laugh,
laugh, laugh.

324
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,934
- Thank you for stopping
by my office.

325
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,333
- All right.
- Bye, Ru.

326
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,734
- Bye.

327
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:36,734
Hey, Delta.

328
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:37,934
- Hi, Ru.

329
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,467
- I have a feeling
you're gonna be very funny.

330
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,800
- Um, I am.

331
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,066
- They say that comedy comes

332
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,533
from, you know, a dark place,

333
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,867
and I have a feeling that
you've spent a lot of time

334
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,567
where, uh,
maybe people have said

335
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,767
some nasty things to you,

336
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,734
and you've had a lot of time

337
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,233
to think about getting back
at them.

338
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,233
Am I right?

339
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,233
- Yes, that's very true.

340
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,300
But I don't want it to seem
like,

341
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,433
"Poor me, poor me, poor me."

342
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,467
I want it to be like, "Poor me,
pour me another one."

343
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm so excited.

344
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,567
I think if I'm clear
and concise about the jokes,

345
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,734
I think that I could win.

346
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:08,967
- I can't wait.

347
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:11,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

348
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,867
All right, ladykins.

349
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,300
Gather around.

350
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,567
In a moment you'll meet
with guest judge Rita Rudner,

351
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,066
who will help you with your

352
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:23,367
chutzpah, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.

353
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,767
Now, Shangela, since you
won the mini challenge,

354
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:29,767
you get an extra ten minutes
with Rita Rudner.

355
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:35,100
Plus you get to choose
the order of the lineup.

356
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,567
- This is where the real shade
is gonna happen.

357
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,467
- Now, tomorrow,
on the main stage,

358
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,800
we'll be joined by guest judge,

359
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,367
the sassy comedian from
<i>Chelsea Lately</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Mad TV,</i>

360
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,066
Arden Myrin.

361
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:49,967
- Whoo!

362
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,300
- Oh, and one more thing.

363
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
You'll be performing
your stand-up

364
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,300
in front of the harshest critics
of all--

365
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,300
a live audience.

366
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
So don't fuck it up.

367
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,066
I'll see you later.

368
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:07,300
- All right, bye.

369
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,600
- I work in front of
an audience at my shows.

370
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,667
It's the best place
to get energy.

371
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,300
The problem is sometimes
that energy is good,

372
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
and sometimes it's bad.

373
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,967
- You guys want to come over,

374
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,166
'cause I got the order of
the show set up for tomorrow.

375
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,867
- Okay.

376
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,734
- I know how it is to work
at a club.

377
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,066
When you go to work
at a drag show,

378
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,166
they usually put the girls

379
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,533
who they don't like
in the beginning.

380
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,900
- Opening the show's
gonna be Raja.

381
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,333
She's, what we call
in the comedy world,

382
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,066
biting the bullet.

383
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:37,100
And then Carmen, Alexis.

384
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,333
I put Carmen second.

385
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,934
If she's great, she follows Raja

386
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,266
and makes Raja look horrible.

387
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:44,367
Alexis, you'll introduce me,

388
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,934
and then I'll introduce Manila.

389
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,066
Then Yara and Delta,

390
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,233
you'll close the show, okay?

391
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,066
I put Manila directly after me.

392
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,967
If she's intimidated by me,

393
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,066
let her be
really intimidated by me.

394
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,467
- Why did you put me in the...

395
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,066
before the last one?

396
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,433
- I know you probably
wanted to be

397
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,600
toward the end of the show,

398
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,500
but I don't want you
to be the last one.

399
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,266
Yara wants to go last,

400
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,500
but I put her next to last.

401
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,700
If she knocks it
out of the park,

402
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,800
that puts Delta
at a disadvantage,

403
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,100
because then she has to
close the show

404
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,300
and go after Yara.

405
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,967
- If the intention
is to fuck with people,

406
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,066
it's not gonna work.

407
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,200
This is my make it moment,

408
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,066
because this is what I do
for a living, and...

409
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,100
- Yeah.

410
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
- Is entertain people
on the microphone.

411
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,567
- What do you think
about the order?

412
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,834
- I think it's a setup.

413
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,867
- For you, like, if I were to go
right after Shangela,

414
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,500
I'd be a little bit nervous.

415
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
- If I go out there and bomb,

416
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,066
it's gonna be like,
"Oh, fuck."

417
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,333
- They should have never told me
they saw me as a threat.

418
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,066
I will see each one of them
go home.

419
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,900
- Hi, Manila.
I'm Rita.

420
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,934
- Hi, Rita.
I'm a huge fan.

421
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:46,066
Rita Rudner is going to be
giving us stand-up advice.

422
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,800
She's one of the funniest people
in show business.

423
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,400
- And what are you going to do
for us today?

424
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,233
- Looking back at
some of the PBS programming

425
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,433
that I used to watch

426
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:58,867
and how gay
it actually seems now.

427
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,400
- Let's hear you
do the first joke.

428
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,133
- So looking back at Mr. Rogers,

429
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,500
I don't know
if he was on the down-low,

430
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,400
because he had a second house.

431
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,333
And every show started out
with a costume change.

432
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,767
Comedy's hard.

433
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,934
I'm just nervous that, like,

434
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,066
other people's routines
are gonna be,

435
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:17,100
like, so much funnier than mine.

436
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,934
- My life is funny.

437
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,567
- And now tell us
some of the funny things.

438
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,166
- I am from Puerto Rico.

439
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,266
Since I was just a little girl.
You know.

440
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,166
- That's funny.
- [clicks tongue]

441
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,200
I went all the way to Florida.

442
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,166
- Maybe let's make a joke
about that.

443
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,100
You say, "I came to Miami.

444
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,166
"I was in first class.

445
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,667
I was in the front of the raft."

446
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,266
- I was in the--in the what?

447
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,333
- In the front of the raft.

448
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,800
- In the raft?
- Yes, that's a raft.

449
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,233
- Girl, I don't know
if I can pronounce that.

450
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:46,066
- My, um, act is gonna be based
on the film<i> Carrie.</i>

451
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:48,600
- I haven't seen<i> Carrie</i>
in 40 years.

452
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
I always worry about
a specific movie reference.

453
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,934
If no one has seen, uh,
the movie, she is in trouble.

454
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,734
- And my outfit that
I'm wearing, actually,

455
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,767
it's sort of this
blood-drenched,

456
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,200
like, you know, gown.

457
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,066
- You come in--"Did anyone else
just get their period?"

458
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,767
- See, I wanted to do
a period joke.

459
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,066
Anybody else get their period?

460
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,100
- "Did anyone else<i> just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get."</i>

461
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,200
-<i> "Just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get their per..."</i>

462
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
So did anyone else
just get their period?

463
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
- But stay still
while you're doing it.

464
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,900
- Anyone else
just get their period?

465
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,066
- There you go.
I laughed.

466
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,934
- So I think what I do is
I want to kind of start out

467
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,400
by maybe
I should drop some weight.

468
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,700
- Good.

469
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,900
- And basically, like, that's
kind of what it's about.

470
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,133
A fat chick's like a unicycle.

471
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,633
Every guy wants to be with one.

472
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,066
They want to take one on a ride.

473
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:31,200
They just don't want to be seen
doing it.

474
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,066
Ultimately, I think what I want
to do is maybe not, like, love,

475
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,066
and maybe not just, like,
a one-night stand.

476
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:39,066
I think what it is is I just
want to sit on a guy's face.

477
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,633
- You're not really talking
about how to lose weight.

478
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,500
- Right.
- You know, you have to decide

479
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,166
what it is that you're going to
talk about.

480
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,834
- I'm a post-modern pimp ho.

481
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,767
I've never performed
as a character

482
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,233
on the stage other than myself.

483
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,066
- You've got it right away.

484
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:57,266
When you come out and say, "Yo,
you know, bitch..."

485
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,800
you've got that--
you've got the character

486
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,166
perfectly right there.

487
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,200
- Great.

488
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,133
But I'm feeling more pressure,

489
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,333
and definitely a little nervous.

490
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,567
You always want to shine,

491
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,133
especially when people think
it's what you do.

492
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,500
- Hi.
- Hello, Yara.

493
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
- Hi.

494
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm supposed to be
a little person.

495
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,233
- Right.

496
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,567
- Yes, I want to make a story.

497
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,934
This girl from Spain.

498
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,333
It's hard to live here
in States,

499
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,100
and I miss the guy.

500
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,934
This gorgeous guy.

501
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,133
And I follow him.

502
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,333
You know, I'm a little person,

503
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,233
and I have to poop.

504
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,233
[imitates flatulence]

505
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,367
Get out, get out,<i> cabron.</i>

506
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,066
Get out, get out, get out,
<i>cabron.</i>

507
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,767
Get out, get out, get out.

508
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:42,166
- That is the most unusual act
I've ever seen.

509
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,734
- Oh.

510
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,333
It's so weird hearing my voice.

511
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,767
- Now, Carmen, are you doing,

512
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,133
um, something personal about you
or other people?

513
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,166
- Haven't really pieced together
what I'm gonna do yet.

514
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,533
- Just say some things you have
on that lovely sheet of paper.

515
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,066
- Um...
- Come on.

516
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,400
You have to say something
in the mic,

517
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,734
otherwise we can't help.

518
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:03,633
- Okay, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

519
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,066
- You silly boy.
Come over here.

520
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,066
- Like, I just have, like,
a bunch of topics that I...

521
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,700
- Okay, what are some more
of your topics?

522
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,100
- Okay, I'm the only queen

523
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,266
that's really here
from new Jersey,

524
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,767
and I don't look at myself
in the mirror

525
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,533
and see a stereotypical
new Jersey person.

526
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,300
- So did you always
feel out of place?

527
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,567
- Never.

528
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,066
- But you should,
because that's gonna be funny.

529
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,100
There's nothing funny about

530
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,567
a good-looking person
doing well,

531

who's confident.

532
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
So think of something that

533
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,467
you're insecure about,
and share it with us.

534
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,900

536

come from,

537
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,100

tonight.

541
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,467
- We're back
in the workroom today,

542
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,767
and the challenge this week

543
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:57,400
is to come up with a hilarious
outfit for the runway

544
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,767
and then perform
a stand-up routine

545
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,567
for a live audience.

546
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,867
- She sounds like--like a goat.

547
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,900
- Girl, I got to learn
this thing by memory.

548
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,533
It's so loud in here, it's still

549
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,767
hard to commit stuff to memory

550
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,500
when everyone's talking,
you know.

551
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,233
- Delta's a little bit shaken
at this point,

554
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,367
because this is a
really high-pressure challenge.

555
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,500
She's struggling, and I really,
really feel for her.

556
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,300

and I'm scared as shit.

Don't stress.
We got this.

We're the Heathers.

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
- Yep.

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,233
- We're the Heathers.

'cause I'm gonna be hilarious!

568
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:01,066
- Before, you was painted like
a motherfuckin' ghost, honey.

569
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,300

so hard?

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,166
I just want to be a fierce
drag queen like the next girl.

571
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,500
- Hey, Manila,
are you going to speak

572
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,266
in, like, your Asian accent?

573
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,767
- Are you gonna speak
with an Espanol accent?

574
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,400
- I can't help it.

[laughter]

576
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,066
- You know what you should do?

577
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,400
You should do
that British accent

578
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,667
you were so successful at.

579
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,600

581
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,200
- Isn't it funny?
- It is funny.

582
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,367
- Manila told Ru that
she's so tired of my mouth.

583
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,800
But you'll never
see her shut up.

584
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,333
I don't even think
she takes air.

585
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,433
- Okay?

This show is gonna start out
with a bang.

587
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,967
- I see Carmen in her fat suit.

588
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,133
It's just--it's so too much.
It's so weird.

I was like, "Really, girl?

This is what you're gonna do?"

00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:47,200
- Bitch, and I want to
lay on it, honey.

592
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,233
- I know that everyone is,

593
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,834
like, "Oh, well, Carmen.

594
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:52,633
I'm worried about Carmen."

595
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,734
My mentality is,
this is going to work.

596
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:55,767
- She just signed the paper.

597
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,300
She's on her way home.

Well, see, good, good.

The real special thing
about Carrie

637
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,200
is that she has
telekinetic powers.

638
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,667
Telekinesis means that you can
move things with your mind.

The last time I moved anything
with my head,

When you first start doing drag,

651
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,367
it's, like, you want to be
the fishiest.

652

You want to have the best body.

no man problems, okay?

sit on the toilet, and become a
mother, okay?

669
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,266
No matter what size I am,

00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:42,900
I will be the body beautiful.

because I always wanted to be
a star, honey,

686
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,967
so I left Puerto Rico behind,

687
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,166
and I moved to united states,

706
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:58,667

the post-modern pimp ho.

I'm still a pimp,
but I'm also my own ho.

That's right.

I'm telling you,
I done had to scale back.

00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,967
You know, and sometimes I don't
even pay myself my own money.

713

Uh-huh.

714
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,066
If I did, maybe
I could get some shoes

715
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,300
where my toes wasn't hanging
five inches off the edge.

716
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,533
Yeah.

717
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,567
I know you tried to clown me
for my cliffhangers.

718
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,900
Yeah, I saw it.

719
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,934
You know, they always try
to clown me on the block, baby.

720

They always saying, "Laquifa!"

721

I say, "What?"

722
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,767
They say, "Laquifa,
where your hoes at?"

723
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,633
I said, "Bitch, don't you see

Ugh!

I had a dumbass girlfriend

728
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
that went and joined PETA?

She said, "Laquifa,

had to die

735

I said, "Bitch,

to get this coat?"

- Hi, everyone.

739
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:12,500
My parents weren't really big
about the TV.

740
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,800
I really only had, like,
PBS and<i> Sesame Street.</i>

741
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,066
Sesame Street
was one gay-ass block.

742

Okay, obviously we have
Bert and Ernie.

743
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,467
I mean, they're so gay,

744
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,333
they practically
are board members of GLAAD.

745
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,967
Um, now,
one of my favorite people

746
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:32,300
that lives on Sesame Street
is the Count.

747
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,700
He's one of those old,
Liberace gays,

748
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,333
and he loves
collecting tchotchkes,

749
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,967
like Faberge eggs.

- Hi, I'm Yara Sofia.

756
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm gonna make
a long story short.

757
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,533
I met a guy in a club,

758
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,333
and he took me
to wonder restaurant

759
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,400
he call McDonald's.

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,367
"You want chicken sandwich?"

761
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:21,367
I go, "What the hell
is chicken?"

762
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,867
She told me,
"Chicken means pollo."

763
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:28,867
Pollo means
"cock" in Spain!

764
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:32,667
So I don't want to eat
a fucking dick sandwich.

765
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,133
After that, he took me
to the apartment,

766
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,367
and he took her clothes off.

767
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,767
"Oh, my god,
what the hell is that?"

768
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,533
He was huge.

769
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:47,934
The difference between an onion
and a 14-inch dick,

770
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,266

I'm in my early to early 30s,

California

just kind of looking for love,
you know,

782
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,567
and it's kind of hard
for a big girl like me,

783
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,266
because it's so
body-conscious in L.A.,

784
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,900
and it freaks me out to think--

785

who is gonna want
a girl like me?

that they go out running

789
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,967
and then they get,
like, abducted and assaulted,

790
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:42,333

I have to eat frozen burritos.

about your performance

805
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,934
was that you had a topper
of your topper line

806
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:16,800

- Yeah.

00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,900
- Next up, Manila.

884
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,133
Now, the<i> Sesame Street</i><span style="bodyStyle"> jokes</i>
were very funny.

885
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,367
Did you think of those, or had
you heard them somewhere else?

886
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,667
- No, I just kind of, like,
quick made it up.

887
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,800
I mean, maybe someone else
suspects it too?

888
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,166
- I think the audience
took a beat to get to know you.

889
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:05,066
And especially
following Laquifa.

890
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,166
You know, you had to really

891
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:09,066
readjust the whole energy
of the audience.

892
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,367
- The content that you had

893
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:12,467
for the jokes
and what they were based on,

894
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,367
some of them were lost

895
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,567
because when we were
sort of laughing,

896
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,500
you were onto the other one.

897
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,633
- Were you nervous?
- I kind of was.

898
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,567
- You did feel the most
rehearsed of everybody.

899
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,400
Like, maybe in a stiffer way.

900
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,800
- Everything about you visually

901
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,467
is right on point tonight,
Manila.

902
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,066
But I feel like I've heard
a lot of those jokes before.

903
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,967
I mean, the Bert and Ernie joke,
let's be honest.

904
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,967
Everybody has been telling that.

905
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:38,900
- Up next, Yara Sofia.

906
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,867
- Yes!

907
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:42,066
Yes!

908
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,867
- What was
your character's name?

909
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,066
- Blara.

910
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,367
I have a friend
that is a little person,

911
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,934
and he pushed me to do it.

912
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,700
- And he would not be offended
by this at all?

913
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,734
- No.

914
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,734
I did it with the respect.

915
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,600
This is the stand-up comedy

916
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,333
that comedians do
in Puerto Rico.

917
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,367
- I was wondering if
it was going to be too graphic,

918
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,266
but I knew your energy
would take care of it,

919
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:04,767
and we loved watching you.

920
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,333
- I don't know
what you talked about,

921
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,834
except chicken and some shit.

922
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,500
- I have to say,
I love the character,

923
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,200
and your capacity
to stay on your knees

924
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,600
could earn you a lot of money
somewhere.

925
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,800
- Up next, we've got Delta Work.

926
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,700
You seemed a little bit nervous.

927
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,333
- I loved the beginning,
but at the end,

928
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,767
we kind of went a bit of
a distance without a laugh.

929
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,433
- I did notice going off-track

930
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,667
of what I thought
I was gonna do,

931
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,834
and I guess in some--
somewhere in my mind,

932
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,433
I thought
that was being organic.

933
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,233
- It started off sort of strong.

934
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:37,066
It felt very defined.

935
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:40,467
And then, I feel like
maybe you lost your way.

936
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,734
And then I felt like
there wasn't a payoff.

937
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:46,066
- Just remember, when
you're portraying a character,

938
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,266
you got to go
all the way with it.

939
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:50,166
So pump it up.

940
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,433
Get out of your head.

941
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,667
- Okay.

942
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,533
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

943
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:58,400
Now, while you all
enjoy an Absolut cocktail

944
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,066
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

945
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,667
the judges and I
will deliberate.

946
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,100
You may leave the stage.

947
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,300
[car engine starts]

948
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,300
- Just between us girls,
let's start with Raja.

949
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,767
- First of all, I love the
bucket of blood on her head.

950
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,667
She didn't really go inward
for her comedy.

951
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,300
- We didn't get to know
anything more about Raja.

952
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,333
- Had she incorporated
or paralleled

953
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,500
her own story
with Carrie's story,

954
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,800
it would have been funny.

955
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,066
Let's talk about Carmen Carrera.

956
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,767
- She was the one
I was worried about.

957
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,800
She didn't tell me one joke.

958
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,166
And she thought about it
and came back with it.

959
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,333
I was so impressed.

960
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,066
- Tonight she did
a great performance.

961
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,967
I was very happy to see
that personality come out.

962
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,900
- Honey, Alexis Mateo.

963
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,600
I was a little disappointed
that she rushed through it.

964
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,300
She didn't let her routine
breathe.

965
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,800
- It just seemed
super amateur to me.

966
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,133
- I liked her physicality.

967
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,300
She had some fun dance moves,

968
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,467
but I don't remember her act.

969
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:52,734
- Shangela.

970
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,734
She was very confident
and comfortable on the stage.

971
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:58,233
- What she had was a character
I've never seen before,

972
00:35:58,233 --> 00:35:59,834
and she has a catchphrase

973
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,667
that I want to hear
over and over.

974
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,166
- To me, as a stand-up,
the audience wants to know

975
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,467
that they're in good hands.

976
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,767
With Laquifa, we wanted to go
along on the ride.

977
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,633
- Her makeup was a lot better
tonight too.

978
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,600
- It really was.

979
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,166
- I think she did a good job.

980
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,266
- Manila Luzon.

981
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:18,433
A lot of people
recognized her routine.

982
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,367
Or it just felt very familiar.

983
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,867
- I do think
she added some things

984
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:24,066
that I'd never heard of,
like Mr. Rogers and the mailman.

985
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,066
I've never heard that.

986
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,967
But it didn't seem fresh.

987
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,367
- Yara Sofia.

988
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,533
That bitch was crazy.

989
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,100
She reminded me of Andy Kaufman,

990
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,867
who did things that sort of
just freaked people out,

991
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,133
but they still laughed.

992
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,400
- I always say, when you do
something, do it 110%.

993
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,433
- Mm-hmm.

994
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,066
- And I think she did it 120%.

995
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,233
- I felt like it could be at,

996
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,200
like, the Whitney Museum as,
like, a performance.

997
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,300
- The Whitney and Bobby Museum.

998
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,467
- [laughs]

999
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:49,066
- Delta Work.

1000
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,200
- It started out good,

1001
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,100
and then it just went
all over the place.

1002
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,633
- It was kind of dark,
wasn't it?

1003
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:55,834
- And it was a bit sad.

1004
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:57,200
- She's thinking way too much

1005
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,433
about everything that she says.

1006
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,200
She's got a constant sadness
around her.

1007
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,166
- All right, silence!

1008
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,934
I've made my decision.

1009
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,300
Send in the clowns.

1010
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,633
- Welcome back, ladies.

1011
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:17,400
Now, based on your ability
to tickle our funny bones,

1012
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,500
I've made some decisions.

1013
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,734
Alexis Mateo,

1014
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:26,834
you're safe.

1015
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,533
- Thank you.

1016
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,233
- Raja...

1017
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:35,100
bloody well done.

1018
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,400
You are safe.

1019
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,333
- Thank you.

1020
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,433
- Manila, your presentation
was stiff.

1021
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:46,233
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1022
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,533
- When Ru says I'm in the bottom
two, I'm in shock.

1023
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,567
At this point in the game,

1024
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,133
like, where we're all so good,

1025
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,867
like, any little fuck-up
is now magnified.

1026
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:59,367
- Shangela,
as a post-modern pimp,

1027
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:03,433
you bitch-slapped
the competition.

1028
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,066
Condragulations.

1029
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,467
You are the winner
of this challenge.

1030
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,300
[applause]

1031
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,600
You've won an original
custom-designed gown

1032
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,900
from Miami Elite Designs.

1033
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
- Hallelu.

1034
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,300
[laughter]

1035
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,266
I'm almost speechless,
and the judges' response to me

1036
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,834
makes me just feel like

1037
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm going
in the right direction.

1038
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,500
Thank you.

1039
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,433
- Yara Sofia, you're safe.

1040
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,333
You may join the other girls.

1041
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,633
- Aah!

1042
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:37,533
[laughter]

1043
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:42,734
- Carmen Carrera, you're safe.

1044
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:46,266
Delta Work, my dear.

1045
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,500
This week, you lost your way.

1046
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,667
I'm sorry, but you are
up for elimination.

1047
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,667
- Okay.

1048
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,467
I'm pissed off because this

1049
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,300
should be my first time
in the bottom.

1050
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,233
This shouldn't be my third time
in the bottom.

1051
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,600
- Two queens stand before me.

1052
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,900
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1053
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,533
and to save yourself
from elimination.

1054
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,066
- Oh, my god.

1055
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:13,433
I don't want Delta to go.

1056
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,633
- The time has come

1057
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:20,433
for you to lip-synch

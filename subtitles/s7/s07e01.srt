{\an8}Greetings, earth queens.
I come in peace.

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,187
{\an8}I'm Miss Fame, I'm 29 years old,
and I'm beyond-this-planet beautiful.

00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,290
Well, it looks like I'm the only one here.
Thank God.

6
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,294
My brand is classic,
chic fashion model.

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,965
I think I might choose a center spot.
Center stage, it feels appropriate.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,467
I'm ready to show everybody
what I'm meant to do,

{\an8}chain-smoking cross-dresser
from Orlando, Florida.

13
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,350
I like to describe myself
as a glamour toad.

14
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,219
-You look gorgeous.
-Something subtle for groceries?

15
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,622
Just a little something
to pick up some apples.

16
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,358
I know that I will never be
the prettiest one,

17
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,894
but I will always be the beautiful one.

18
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,633

-How you doing? Come on, Miss Sickening.
-Okay, girl.

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,249
And is there another big girl?
I can only be the only big girl.

24
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:28,054
She's gonna serve you body. She's gonna
serve you everything you need to survive.

25
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,191
I'm always gonna give you life.

[Jaidynn] Uh-oh... Who is it?

27
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,832
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.

28

[Violet] <i>My biggest strength</i>
<i>is probably aesthetics.</i>

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,146
I'm very visually appealing.
Is that conceited?

00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,448
-Miss Fame.
-Violet Chachki.

34
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,751
Violet Chachki,
you can't forget that. [laughs]

35
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:04,424
I've seen Miss Fame's work before, and I'm
pretty impressed, but not that impressed.

36
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,496
[Violet] Tall fish.

37
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,031
{\an8}Well, it's about time.

-And you're Max?
-Yes, I'm Max.

40
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,139
-Period? Just Max?
-Max, period or capitalized,

41
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,041
or any way you want
to say it or spell it.

42
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,243
Cool.

43
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,980
I do drag because I have the yearning
for old Hollywood glamour.

44
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,916
-Where are you from, Max?
-I'm from Wisconsin, actually.

45
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,518
[Violet] Wisconsin.

46
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,956
Well, yes, this is a contest for queens,
but not the Queen of England, girl.

47
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,626
-Can I look at your paper?
-Of course.

48
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,794
[Miss Fame]
Let me teach you a beauty trick.

49
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,132
[Miss Fame] Blot away that shine.

50
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,136
I don't know if that came across shady,
but thank you, Max.

51
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,940
C'mon season seven!

52
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,176
-[Miss Fame] Is this Russia?
-[Katya] With love.

53
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,946
{\an8}My name is Ekatarina Petrovna Zamochkova,
but you can call me Katya.

54
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,447
[Jaidynn] Come on, accent.

55
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,919
{\an8}I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill,
Russian, bisexual transvestite hooker.

56
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,789
Is this the Shulman Bar Mitzvah?
[speaking Russian]

57
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,027
Katya is at the intersection
of glamour and comedy.

58
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,564
You can find her right on the corner,
selling her ass.

59
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,334
-Is this Soviet Union inspired?
-It's my great-grandma's army uniform.

60
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,403
[laughter]

61
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:29,409
-I'm here! We made it, bitches!
-[all] Yes!

62
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,246
{\an8}I'm Jasmine Masters,
and I'm 37 years old. Ding!

63
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,782
-How did you get this body?
-Girl, I don't know.

64
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,919
Jasmine is class and elegance.
Jasmine is... [snapping fingers]

65
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,787
...it.

66
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,455
-Where are you from?
-Nashville.

67
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,924
-Nashville, I'll be there. And you?
-Atlanta.

68
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,894
All right, Atlanta. Hotlanta, girl.

69
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,496
No one says that, but yes.

70
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,432
Okay, work.

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,071
Hi, my honeys, I'm home! [laughs]

72
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:03,476
Are there any other queens here?
Oh, just me, I guess. [laughs]

73
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,512
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis. [laughs]

74
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,282
I'm an international celebrity housewife,

75
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,384
because of that one time
I performed in Canada.

76
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,686
-Nice to meet you.
-I like your tits.

77
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,356
-Mine are still bigger, though.
-[all] Whoa, whoa!

78
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,625
-Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
-I'm jealous.

79
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,060
I don't have any fat to push together.

80
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,100
This isn't Maury Povich.

81
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,936
{\an8}My name is Trixie Mattel,
and I'm 24 years old.

82
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,272
Oh, my goodness!

83
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,275
Well, here's another comedy queen.

84
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,112
She has her overdrawn lips
and clown makeup. She is ready to go.

85
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,414
I'm a hair and makeup artist.

86
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,651
So...

87
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,488
I think a lot of the queens don't
necessarily get where I'm coming from.

88
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,757
Drag queens always say,
"Paint for the back row."

89
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,926
I paint for the check-cashing place
down the street.

90
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,864
I hope you girls have a sweet tooth,

91
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,534
because Kandy is
in the motherfucking house.

92
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,403
[Jaidynn] She's got a tag line.

93
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,139
{\an8}I'm Kandy Ho, and I'm 28 years old.

94
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,310
-From Puerto Rico.
-[all] Puerto Rico!

95
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,579
Kandy is hot.
Kandy is <i>candente</i>.

96
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,983
If you touch her too close,
you might get burned.

97
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,621
[cheering]

98
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,557
-[Jaidynn] Look who walked in, bitch.
-'Sup?

99
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,995
{\an8}I'm Pearl. I'm 23 years old.

100
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:35,768
I would describe Pearl as some kind
of robotic, Stepford Wife bitch.

101
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,438
-[Pearl] Hey, girls.
-[all] Hi, welcome.

102
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,775
I notice this black trim around her chin,
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"

103
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,078
But hey, you like it,
rock your own boat.

104
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,513
Come on, chin strap.

105
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,285
-Well, hello.
-[cheering]

106
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:57,056
{\an8}I'm Kennedy Davenport,
and I am the dancing diva of Texas, honey.

107
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,292
-Wait, Kennedy!
-Yes.

108
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,761
-Oh, my God!
-That's me.

109
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:07,033
I spin, I kick, I flip,
I jump off the stage in 6-inch heels.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,203
That's what puts the diva in it.

111
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,107
Get over here.
I wanted to meet you forever, girl!

112
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,276
I'm a big fan of Kennedy Davenport.

113
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,114
I've been wanting to meet her for so long.
Like, Ru turned the party for me.

114
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,282
Oh, my God! [laughs]

115
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,552
For real, y'all,
I'm geeked the fuck up.

116
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm geeked! I'm geeked!

117
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,363
Hey, it's me.
Say hello to my little friend!

118
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,633
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle,
I'm 28 years old,

119
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,170
{\an8}and I have been mentally preparing myself
for this for years.

120
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,471
[Miss Fame] Just anywhere will do.

121
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,275
I could tell you every episode,
what the challenge was, who went home.

122
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,077
I feel like I've cracked the code.

123
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,112
Hey, girls, what's going on?

124
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,516
I'm the next Drag Superstar
because I've done my homework.

125
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,420
Girl, please. No, sorry.

126
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,188
Next.

127
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,994
Who's ready for some hot tuna casserole?
'Cause mama's home.

128
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,495
Ugh!

129
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,063
[laughter]

130
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,233
[Jasmine] No, ma'am.

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,769
{\an8}I'm Tempest DuJour,
and I'm 46 years old.

132
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,137
[Miss Fame] A baby!

133
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,774
My drag style
is influenced by Phyllis Diller

134
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,076
and the campy
and kitschy people of the world.

135
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,613
-Your baby is adorable.
-Thank you. It's Amber, Amber Alert.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,015
[Max] Amber Alert.

137
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,753
Tempest, she's an old-fashioned drag.
She tries to be funny, I guess.

138
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,823
-So how old are you?
-[Jaidynn] Oh!

139
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,058
[Tempest] How old am I?

140
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,326
Really?

141
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,628
Who the hell does that?

142
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,997
Who in their first meeting says
"How old are you"?

143
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,201
[Tempest] You don't stop dreaming
at a certain age.

144
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,103
[alarm sounding]

145
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,207
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>She is all ready to have hers!</i>

<i>-Your Ru-Ru here.</i>

and ready for the ride of your life.

[all] Yes.

157

00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,374
you need to dig in your trunks

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,577
and model two
of your very best looks,

166
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,248
one from your spring collection
and one from your fall collection.

167
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,920
This is right up my alley, and I can't
wait for everyone to gag on my eleganza.

168
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,591
Your runway will be part
of this week's final evaluation.

169
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,229
Kill it on the catwalk
or end up fashion roadkill.

170
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,597
Your choice.

171
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:29,068
Dang, this is a lot for the first day.
They got us doing runways.

172
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,003
Hashtag too much.

173
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,876
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

174
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,915
{\an8}[sighs] Why do fashion shows
always start so late?

175
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,217
{\an8}For today's mini challenge,
we have to showcase

176
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:49,055
{\an8}our spring and fall looks on the runway,
sponsored by DKoye, the product for hair.

177
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,792
This is not a mini challenge.
This is a maxi mini challenge...

178
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,260
with wings.

179
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,295
Oh, wait a minute, it's starting.

180
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,266
{\an8}[RuPaul] Serving spring glamour,
Ginger Minj.

181
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,403
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>I'm doing runway for Michelle</i>
<i>Visage, RuPaul and Carson Kressley.</i>

182
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,838
I think I can see her tool.

183
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,306
[laughter]

184
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,176
[Ginger] <i>I know I can excel</i>
<i>at anything I put my mind to.</i>

185
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:15,047
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Milan, Paris, New York...

186
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,849
{\an8}Pacoima.

187
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,720
{\an8}[Kandy] <i>I'll give you face, I'll give</i>
<i>you ass, I'll give you legs.</i>

188
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,423
This Latina,
she's coming for all of you.

189
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,425
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Max.</i>

190
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,295
{\an8}[Carson] Yes, darling. Sell the garment.

191
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:34,233
I'm making sure that I'm delivering,
and I get to fully portray the character.

192
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,870
[Alaska] I've had pelvic exams
more thrilling than this.

193
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,641
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.

194
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:46,312
[Carson] It's very Apollonia.
Apollonia six and seven.

195
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,016
-[RuPaul and Carson] And eight and nine.
-[Michelle] All the girls.

196
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,852
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Oh...

197
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,955
-[Carson] I do love a onesie for spring.
-[RuPaul] Yes.

198
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,358
-Excellent use of the cape.
-[RuPaul] Yes.

199
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,360
How dull.

200
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,597
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.

201
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,066
[RuPaul] I love you,
but give me Park Avenue.

202
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,367
[Michelle laughs] Yes.

203
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,236
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis is a lady.</i>

204
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,272
Anybody can be a girl,
but it takes a lot of balls to be a lady.

205
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,976
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mitzi Gaynor.
Trixie Mattel.

206
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,679
{\an8}[Michelle] We finally know
what happened to Baby Jane.

207
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,882
My family's Native American.
We grew up very, very poor.

208
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,784
<i>But Trixie, she has it all.</i>

209
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,953
The biggest problem in her life is
what to wear the next day.

210
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,057
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.

211
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,626
-[RuPaul] Fur for spring.
-[Carson] Yes.

212
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,861
[RuPaul] Blame it on climate change.

213
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:40,366
Bitch, I'm from New York,
and you can wear fur in spring, okay?

214
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,335
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.

215
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,604
{\an8}[Michelle] Who is under that skirt?

216
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,274
[RuPaul] My first guess
would be Jimmy Hoffa.

217
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,843
[Michelle]
Oh, Geraldo should have gone there.

218
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,813
♪ <i>Sexy, sexy drag queen</i> ♪

219
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,082
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame!

220
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,951
[Carson] I would read her,
but she's red all over.

221
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:03,122
My strongest suit is modeling. Ideally,
that will carry me to get that crown.

222
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,925
-I see a red bottom, and it's not a shoe.
-Oh!

223
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,160
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>just a gag-worthy moment. </i>

224
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,863
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters.

225
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,765
[RuPaul] No jacket required.

226
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,535
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine Master is</i>
<i>bright as summer. I am here.</i>

227
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,105
H-E-R-E, bitch, I'm here.

228
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,941
{\an8}[Carson] Simple midriff.
It's tasteful.

229
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,143
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.

230
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,679
[Michelle] Oh, dear, she has a toothache.

231
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,615
-[Carson] I can see her spleen.
-[RuPaul] Spleens are very in this year.

232
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,118
-[Carson] Spleens are the new orange.
-[RuPaul] Yes.

233
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,588
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Niecy Nash.

234
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,990
I'm old school and
a touch of new school.

235
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,427
[Kennedy] Everything is bigger in Texas,
and I fit right on in.

236
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,095
[Michelle] She needs a casserole.

237
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,997
[RuPaul] But not tuna.

238
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,032
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.

239
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,535
{\an8}<i>I see those judges,</i>
<i>give 'em a little look.</i>

240
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,272
{\an8}I need to show them
how much I want this.

241
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,241
[Carson] She already has a fan.

242
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,578
[Alaska] Who uses fans anymore?

243
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,318
Now it's time to do our fall look.
Child, the struggle is real.

244
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,189
{\an8}[RuPaul] Let's see what they're
serving for fall. Ginger Minj.

245
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,291
{\an8}Ginger Minj is a plus-size diva.

246
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,394
{\an8}She always wants to look
neat, petite, and ready to eat.

247
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,131
-[RuPaul] She's like a magazine editor.
-[Carson] Yeah, popular wildlife.

248
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,269
{\an8}It's so hideous,
I think I'll put it on the cover.

249
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,304
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Fur again.

250
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,840
[Carson] More fur.
It's shaved beaver, I believe.

251
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,108
[Michelle laughs]

252
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,076
{\an8}[RuPaul] Max.

253
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,012
{\an8}[Carson]
I'm having Jil Sander flashbacks.

254
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,713
-Yes, right?
-And I like it.

255
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,750
-[RuPaul] Very Tilda Swinton.
-[Carson] Very.

256
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,954
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
I see Chaka Khan.

257
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,190
[Carson] She's every woman.

258
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:48,727
This is definitely a signature
Jaidynn Diore Fierce look.

259
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,997
[Jaidynn] I'm the other,
other, other Tyra.

260
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,568
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Fur's back.

261
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,869
[RuPaul] Yes, fur is back.

262
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,005
[Katya] I'm giving you dead animal
camouflage, Duck Dynasty realness.

263
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,541
Pamela Anderson, I'm so sorry.

264
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,878
[RuPaul] Oh, my God, she killed it.
I mean, she really killed it.

265
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,012
[Michelle] Literally.

266
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,915
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.

267
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,552
-[RuPaul] Look at those curves.
-[Michelle] These are not for sale.

268
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,355
[Carson] I'm thinking Colombian
mother of the bride.

269
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,723
[Michelle chuckles]

270
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,492
{\an8}[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.

271
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,596
{\an8}-[Carson] The handbag matches.
-[Michelle] Is that a sequins dress?

272
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,198
-[RuPaul] That is a sequins dress.
-[Michelle] Yes.

273
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,802
[Michelle] It's like two pigs
fighting under a blanket back there.

274
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,539
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
You can't lose with black, you know?

275
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,107
[Michelle] She's a lady DJ.

276
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,276
[Michelle] Eat your heart out,
Paris Hilton.

277
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,346
I'm sure she's listening
to <i>Born Naked</i>, my new album.

278
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,515
-Of course.
-Can you hear us right now?

279
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,051
[Carson] Hello? Nothing.

280
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,554
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.

281
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,291
[Tempest] <i>The look I've chosen</i>
<i>is intended to show</i>

282
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,561
that I can have more than one kind
of campy, kitschy look.

283
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,164
-[Carson] I like the quilted poncho.
-[Michelle] It's a car cover.

284
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,199
[RuPaul laughs]

285
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,334
Please make it stop.

286
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,538
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame. Wow.

287
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,475
-[RuPaul] Golden lady.
-[Carson] It's not lame, it's <i>lamé</i>.

288
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,843
[Michelle chuckles]

289
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,678
[Carson] I do like the fascinator.

290
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,882
-I'm fascinated by fascinators.
-Me too, I could talk about them for days.

291
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,686
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters. Wow.

292
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,221
[RuPaul] Purple Rain.

293
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,357
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine is</i>
<i>in a purple trench coat with black fur.</i>

294
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,328
Well, not really fur.
Just some old carpet I straightened out.

295
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,696
[Jasmine laughs]

296
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,100
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.

297
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,568
[Carlson] Looking smart in tartan.

298
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,937
[Michelle] Getting a reveal.

299
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,506
[all] Oh!

300
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,574
[RuPaul] Bay City Roller.

301
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:49,415
I'm giving you tartan eleganza. Being able
to serve two looks in one is a talent.

302
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,917
It's okay.

303
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:57,756
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Yes, she's going back to her roots.

304
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:02,594
-[Michelle] All that green.
-[RuPaul] She's a sexy choir master.

305
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,829
[Carson] Yes.

306
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,031
[Michelle] Exactly what I was thinking.

307
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,500
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
Oh, my word!

308
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,071
{\an8}-[Carson] Fan's back. Wow.
-[Michelle laughs]

309
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:17,443
-[Carson] What's going on in front?
-[Michelle] The underbelly of a lobster.

310
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:26,318
♪ <i>Cover girl, put the bass in your walk</i>
<i>Head to toe, let your whole body talk</i> ♪

311
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,422
-[RuPaul] I want one in every color.
-[Carson] Now we know what to wear.

312
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,092
-[Michelle, RuPaul] Yeah.
-I'll be wearing lobster.

313
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,894
Yeah. I go for my first
shell fitting next week.

314
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,663
[Carson] Oh, God!

315
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,735
Hi, everybody.
It's so nice to finally meet all of you.

316
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:48,007
Everybody's taking off their drag, and I'm
like, "Who the fuck are these people?"

317
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:53,045
Trixie... Did somebody from the crew
just wander into the workroom?

318
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,147
Pearl? Trade.

319
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,952
Ginger's transformation is remarkable.
She goes from Kathy Bates to Bob Hoskins.

320
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,157
-Hello, hello, hello, ladies!
-[all] Hi!

321
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:11,930
Well, well, well. This is the most
draggedy season premiere ever!

322
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,469
And we're just getting started. Pit crew!

323
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,606

-Oh, my goodness!

325
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,645
Oh, my goodness!

326
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,815
I think the new pit crew member
may be Jewish.

329
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,923
All right, ladies,
the pit crew arrived in the buff

330
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,494
because for the first time
in Drag Race her-story,

331
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,898
you'll be making your
main stage debut...

332
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,333
naked...

333
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,437
-...and afraid.
-[hooting]

334
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,272
[screams]

335
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,678
You need to create a resort-wear look
that tears away to reveal

336
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,182
{\an8}a nude illusion.
Because you were what?

337
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:08,754
{\an8}Hashtag, born naked and the rest is drag.

338
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,324
No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade,
but looking at some of these queens,

339
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,795
I'm thinking, "Ru, you don't want to see
these girls naked. I know you don't."

340
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,833
{\an8}The Maxi Challenge this week is
to create resort wear that has a tear-away

341
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,401
{\an8}to reveal a nude illusion.

342
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,405
I pride myself on utilizing literally
none of my natural features,

343
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,374
so a challenge where I compete
with these beautiful fishy girls

344
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,777
with perfect bodies
is a worst-case situation.

345
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,745
{\an8}I'm just hoping
this looks expensive.

346
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,851
{\an8}My brand that is Miss Fame is
runway shows, fashion magazines, glamour.

347
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,287
So I love this challenge.
I really want to win badly.

348
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,555
That looks resort-y.

349
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,559
Does anybody have scissors?
Be a good Christian and let me use them.

350
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,196
-Hey, cutie girl.
-[all] Hi.

351
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,100
-How are my nudie-patootie?
-[Jasmine] Nude.

352
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,070
-Well, Tempest DuJour.
-RuPaul.

353
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,807
I'm excited to see what you come up with.
I know you're a costume designer.

354
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,375
I am. I teach it,

355
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,346
so I feel a little pressure
from my students who'll be watching this.

356
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,149
When you auditioned a few years ago,
you were still heavy.

357
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,253
-Yeah. I was just under 400 pounds.
-Ex-squeeze me?

358
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,856
<i>I'm trying to lead by example.</i>
<i>That was the catalyst for the weight loss.</i>

359
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,893
Part of it was,
I gotta be alive for these kids.

360
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,929
{\an8}I've been with my husband now
for eight years,

361
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,732
{\an8}<i>and I have two amazing</i>
<i>and beautiful adopted children.</i>

362
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,869
I'm at a place in my life now where
my children are more important to me

363
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,338
than that bucket of fried chicken.

364
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,408
I'll let you get back to work.
I want to see what you come up with.

365
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,577
-Thanks, Ru. Bye.
-Thanks.

366
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,947
-Kandy Ho.
-Hey, mamas.

367
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,251
From the Ho family of products.
Tell me about your nude illusion.

368
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,821
Traditionally on our show,
Puerto Ricans like to show a lot of body.

369
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:55,093
I love to show body.
I think this runway is right on my alley.

370
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,930
-It's on your alley? [laughs]
-Yes.

371
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,300
-Okay. Do you know how to sew?
-I don't.

372
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,736
How do you become a drag queen
without knowing how to sew?

373
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,307
I think it takes more than sewing,
because you can know how to sew,

374
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,842
but you can have
the worst taste ever.

375
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,845
Any sensible queen should know
how to make a dress.

376
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,982
You know, it's part of the game
you have to play.

377
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,586
Oh, bitch!

378
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,356
-Why, Jasmine Masters!
-Yes, mother Ru?

379
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,992
What are you planning
for the reveal on the main stage?

380
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,096
It's like a butterfly in a cocoon.

381
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,732
-I've heard of those, yes.
-I'm going to be

382
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,568
some type of a cocoon that grows.

383
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:41,273
So, as I'm walking down the runway,
I'm gonna grow.

384
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,276
The butterfly is actually in the cocoon.
This is the cocoon.

385
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,312
-Right...
-Which is me, the butterfly.

386
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,115
-You know, like a butterfly in a cocoon?
-Uh-huh.

387
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:56,021
Every step that I take down the runway,
the butterfly inside is growing.

388
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,889
Oh, yeah.

389
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,062
So once I get to the end of the runway,
the butterfly is there.

390
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,070
Okay, great. Great.
Well, keep working. All right.

391
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,809
{\an8}Jasmine's resort tear-away
is two hula hoops with fabric around it.

392
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,613
Who the hell is going
to a resort wearing that?

393
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:27,753
All right, ladies. Get ready to
put on a show, and then take it all off.

394
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:32,457
Good luck!
And remember, don't fuck it up.

395
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:42,100
-[Trixie] Your partner, are you married?
-Yeah. We got married last year.

396
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,504
[Trixie] My boyfriend's family,
last Christmas, they really liked me.

397
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,273
Then they found out about drag
and called him in a panic.

398
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,209
-"Don't be with somebody like that."
-[Miss Fame] For real?

399
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,413
{\an8}They don't like drag.
I don't understand how they don't get

400
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,248
{\an8}that it's just me playing a person.

401
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,484
His mom said, "Trixie's clown drag
makes me sick to my stomach."

402
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,886
[Miss Fame] Oh, my God.

403
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,387
They were right about one thing.

404

405
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,164
-This is really happening.
-[Violet] I know. Someone's going home.

406
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,802
{\an8}I am terrified for this elimination.
We have to be naked,

407
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,172
and I have the body
of a 55-year-old Irish rock climber.

-[Ross] She can't play with no balls.

478

[Trixie] <i>I'm valley girl,</i>
<i>she's at the resort, playing tennis.</i>

-[Trixie] <i>Surprise!</i>

480
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,370
<i>It kind of looks like a doll,</i>
<i>so I'm giving you hinges.</i>

<i>Life in plastic is fantastic.</i>

482

[Kathy] A living doll.

-[Michelle] Oh.

485

{\an8}[Carson] That's what I call
Greek Goddess dressing.

486

[Pearl] <i>My resort tear-away look</i>

489
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,330

-[Michelle] Yes!

494
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,242

495
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:56,147

<i>I'm clinging for dear life to my crutches</i>

497
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,619
[Michelle] This is Helmut Newton's
Nadja Auermann shoot.

00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,289
-[RuPaul] Yes, it is.
-[Carson] Using her props as a crutch.

-[Michelle] Sweet little lemon drop.

-[all gasp]
-[Ross] We have a crack problem.

502
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,900

you'd find on the street.

-Your fall look, crustacean chic.

556
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,088
{\an8}-It was a little overwhelming.
-[Michelle] You're doing a nude illusion.

557
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,657
{\an8}Why are you showing huge,
black undergarments?

558
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,126
I think I was confused
by the assignment.

559
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,830
Well, to be fair, all of the girls
were told the exact same thing.

560
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,633
All right, next up, Miss Fame.

561
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,303
{\an8}On the runway, the looks are fantastic.
They're bold.

562
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,205
You look frighteningly fierce.

00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:11,743
{\an8}And I love a pointed shoulder.
Let's go back to <i>Dynasty</i> while we can.

564
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,714
I thought the little blue number was cute.
I just expected a little bit more.

566
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:25,523

-Yes!

I loved your Bob Mackie butterfly.

00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:36,568
-If you readjust the girls, the nipples--
-I can't. It's the way it's painted.

-Michelle's surgeon can fix you right up.
-Yeah.

How did it feel walking the runway?

573
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,079
I just recently lost a ton of weight,
so doing nude body

574
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,048
is a cathartic moment for me today.

575
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,584
-Condragulations on your weight loss.
-Thank you.

576
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,189
On that note, your runway look tonight,
you're wrinkly, you're droopy.

577
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,825
You're a thin girl now.
Let's talk about your runway numbers.

578
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:05,129
I'm not a fan of quilt-like materials
because they tend to make us look bigger.

579
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,499
You just lost all this weight,
and you just put on 50 pounds.

580

Next up, Jasmine Masters.
How are you feeling up there?

581
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,874
I am so happy, I'm shitting out
happiness to be here.

582
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,278
I loved your "Cirque de So-Gay" tube
that you popped out of.

583
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,314
Then I was like,
"Take off the fringy thing!"

584
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,951
I want to see that gorgeous body.
More nudity!

585
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,790
And your fall look, I don't get it.
It just looks old and dated.

00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,292
[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.

587
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,896
Nothing says resort
like a tunic with no pants.

588
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:42,300
And I was just like, "Oh, God, I can see
her <i>chocha</i>." That's Spanish for vagina.

589
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,336
You're a beautiful queen.
You've got the body.

590
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,574
Your contouring on the other hand...
Girl, this is not a nightclub. This is TV.

591
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:54,012
It looks like you literally
contoured on a beard.

592
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,948
No.

593
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,984
[RuPaul] Up next, Violet Chachki.

594
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,888
In the tartan look, when you put your
thing down, flipped it, and reversed it,

595
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,458
-I almost fell off of my chair.
-And speaking about a reveal...

596
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:12,430
I would've somehow liked to have seen it
jujed a little, 'cause I'm getting boy.

597
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,067
I actually really enjoyed
seeing your real boy body.

598
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:21,172
You had that essence of those crazy skinny
models that may or may not have boobs.

599
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,674
Thank you, Kathy.

600
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,679
Ladies, I have one final question,
and I want the naked truth.

601
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:32,183
Which queen has least
impressed you thus far?

602
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,485
{\an8}-Sasha?
-I'd have to say Pearl.

603
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,287
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame?
-Jaidynn.

604
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,790
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport?
-Trixie.

605
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,259
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour?
-Ginger.

606
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:46,698
{\an8}-The naked truth, Jasmine.
-Sasha, because she just came out plain.

607
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,968
-All right, Kandy Ho?
-Tempest. He is mature,

608
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:54,172
but I think in drag, you have
to upgrade yourself to not bore people.

609
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:58,109
Interesting. When we did introductions
the first day, she didn't say hello.

610
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,944
Her first response was, "How old are you?"

611
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:04,415
I wanted to know your age because you look
older, and your look wasn't my favorite.

612
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,685
I just wanted to know
where you were coming from. That's it.

613
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,722
-All right, Violet Chachki?
-Sasha.

614
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:14,926
-She kind of faded into the background.
-How did I fade into the background?

615
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,429
-I wore a lobster dress.
-[laughter]

616
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,734
Well, thank you, ladies.
Now, while you untuck backstage,

617
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,536
the judges and I will deliberate.

618
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:30,074
Okay, now, just between us
gay icons, what do you think?

619
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,644
-[RuPaul] <i>Sasha Belle.</i>
-Her nude-illusion look was kind of messy.

620
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,513
That body suit sucked.
Come on.

621
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,283
It had a black bra.
Misunderstanding, my ass!

622
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,720
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
-The fall-spring looks made a statement.

623
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,491
She's just so pretty.
I like a little stank on my drag queens.

624
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,493
The proportions of Miss Fame's body

625
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,995
reminded me of Marlene Dietrich
in the later years.

626
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,331
-She had a little stank on her then.
-Yes.

627
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,901
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-I just ate her with a spoon.

628
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,870
She might get a little costume-y.

629
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,706
-Why is that a bad thing on a drag queen?
-No, I--

630
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,475
It's not like a star-trooper costume
from Party City.

633
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,015
Her body suit was all saggy.
I wish she could pull it all together.

634
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,918
-But here's the thing, she's a costumer.
-Yeah.

635
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,188
The style's wrong, but the heart is right.

I love the sassy kind of sister
with the NeNe Leakes hair.

638
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:26,230
-But the other outfit was so wrong.
-I want to see some fabulousness.

639
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,933
-Is that too much to ask for on this show?
-[all] No.

-[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>
-Girl, are you painting on a beard?

641
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,440
I had a beard once. She was wonderful,
but I don't bring her here.

643

644

Look, don't you talk
to a 53-year-old comedian about age.

645
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,383

and that's what I want to see here.

648
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,591
Tonight, I am getting boy
with a tape tuck.

649
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,227
I could not disagree with you more.
She took a risk!

650
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,429
-It wasn't feminine enough.
-[RuPaul claps]

651
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:04,635
Silence! I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

652
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,372
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

653
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,409
Kennedy Davenport,

00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,177
you're safe.

00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,218
Violet Chachki, on the runway
and on the main stage,

656
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:26,023
you took fashion risks,
and they paid off big time.

657
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,627
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

Tempest DuJour, your runway presentation
left the judges feeling...

668
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,366
crabby.

669
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,471
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

670
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:19,410
Kandy Ho,
your fashion looks were worn,

671
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:25,016
and your nude illusion was,
shall we say, overshadowed.

672
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:31,255
Jasmine Masters,
your personality is off the hook,

673
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,927
but your runway fashions
looked off the rack.

00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,698
Jasmine Masters,

675
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,937

-Thank you.

but you are up for elimination.

{\an8}What the fuck?
I did an amazing job.

678
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,915
There are other girls
who should have been in my place.

679
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,918
Two queens stand before me.

680
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:06,624
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

681
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,927
and save yourself from elimination.

1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,300
- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,433
you'll be starring in two soaps.

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,467
Telenovela style.

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,100
- Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,066
It's another acting challenge.

6
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,500
- I have to reform Relaskatox.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,100
- I don't want the judges to

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,734
see me relying on a clique.

9
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:21,233
- Chimichanga!

10
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,834
- [gasps] Oh!

11
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,700
Ay! Ay! Si! Si! Si!

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,333
Oy! Oy!

13
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,934
- Alyssa, you need to at least

14
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:31,367
match what Jinkx is doing.

15
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:36,200
- That dress is the worst dress
I've ever seen in five seasons.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,800
- When you go to the clubs,
you don't ask the girls,

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,867
"Did you sew that,
did you make that?"

18
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,367
I am an entertainer.

19
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,333
- Alyssa,
that's not what this is about.

20
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,367
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.

21
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,467
[applause]

22
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,567
Coco Montrese,
shante, you stay.

23
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:58,300
Alyssa Edwards, sashay away.

24
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,734
- Girl...
- Agh!

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,700
Going into the workroom,
it really was a sweet moment

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,567
to see Alyssa leave the stage.

27
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,867
- "The sky is the limit

28
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,934
when your heart's in it."

29
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,900
- How do you feel?
- I feel free.

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,767
I feel a weight
lifted off of me.

31
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,633
- Are you making another
fat joke about her?

32
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,533
- Oh! Miss Jinkx!

33
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,066
- I'm happy that this book
is closed.

34
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,233
- Coco believes
that this has closed

35
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,633
a big chapter in her life.

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,800
So the hope now
is that she doesn't take

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,767
all of that Alyssa aggression
and put it on one of us.

38
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:41,900
- Now it's time to be
America's next drag superstar.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
Thank you, girls.

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,900
all: Ooh...

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,467
- Jinkx, you bitch.

42
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,900
You're the first one
to win two challenges.

43
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,734
- It was such a toss-up
between you and 'Laska.

44
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,834
- Jinkx is my biggest
competition.

45
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,367
She's really funny,
and so am I, so...

46
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,867
[clicks tongue]

47
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:02,667
- And Roxxxy was in the top
three too.

48
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,400
- We're trying to get Jinkx
out of here.

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,300
She's a big threat, and I don't
know where I got to get you,

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,400
but I got to find
somewhere that you lack.

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,934
- RuPaul, can we please sew
something for next week?

52
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:13,967
- No sewing, Ru!

53
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,066
- So I can win a damn challenge!

54
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,400
- Let's just hope
I have enough fabric

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,867
to braid myself another dress.
[laughs]

56
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,600
- I'm sorry, my dear.

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,934
Your sewing looks like shit.

58
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,467
- I just feel like
there are people

59
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:30,333
who are just waiting for me
to screw up big-time.

60
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,834
- Your sewing looks like
Coco's performance.

61
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,934
Shit.

62
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,900

We're back in the workroom,
it's a new week,

00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,900

of messing up now.

[siren blares]

80
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,400

You've got shemail!

82
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:35,767
Sometimes a drag queen's gotta
do what a drag queen's gotta do,

00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,734
whether it's laying a foundation

84

or painting the house down.

You've got to spackle,
Neely, spackle!

- Oh...
- What?

91
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,700
- Hello, hello, hello.

92
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,166
all: Hi, Ru.

93
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,600
- Now, to keep you
in fighting shape,

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
for today's mini challenge,

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,233
you're going to go to...

96
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,467

Go!

00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,934
- Ooh.

104
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,233
- Le Dame.

105
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:25,367
- This must be
what my mom feels like.

106
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,934
- Ladies, meet your
personal trainer.

108
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,734
From Barry's Bootcamp, Storm.

109
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,066
- Mash.

110
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,734
- Now, the one queen
that outlasts the others...

111
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:41,967
wins.

112
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:42,967
- Ooh.

113
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,266
- Let's get it up, come on.

114
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,533
I don't know,
but I've been told.

115

all: I don't know,
but I've been told.

116
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
- Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.

117
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,500
all: Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,900
- Pump it, girls.
Pump it, ladies.

119
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,967
Keep that energy up.

120
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,300
Jinkx, you took off your heels.

121
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,533
- They fell off!

122
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,200
- Come on, you call yourself
a drag queen?

123
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,934
- Here we go, ladies.

124
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,533
- Pull up.

125
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,567
Come on, count it off.

126
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,300
- I don't like working out
around other people.

127
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,300
I get ugly when I work out.

128
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,333
- Get up, get up, get up!

130
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,066
- Detox, you're out.

131
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,800
Keep crunching, come on.

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,633
Coco, you're out.

133
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,967
Keep it going.

134
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,266
Roxxxy, you're out.

135
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,633
Up!

136
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,266
It's just between
Jinkx and Alaska.

137
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,400
Come on, now.

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,567
- Finally, my opportunity
to push Jinkx

139
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,600
down the proverbial stairs.

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,166
- Who's gonna be the last queen
crunching?

141
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,500
- Oh, Jinkx is out.

142
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,767
Alaska wins.

00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,800
[clapping]

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
- Whoo-hoo!

145
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Let's do some more!

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,734
- Alaska, condragulations.

147
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,934
- Thank you.
- Bye, ladies.

148
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,567
I'll see you at the gym.
- See ya there.

149
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:52,734
Not really.

150
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:55,934
- Now, you ladies have bravely
soldiered

151
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:58,200
through challenge
after challenge.

152
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,934
Now it's time to give back

153
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:05,066
to those who have
sacrificed so much

154
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,500
to serve this great nation.

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,133
Oh, boys!

156
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,633
- [gasps]

157
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,467
- God bless America.

158
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,900
- These gentlemen,
who also happen to be gay,

159
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,500
served our country
before the repeal

160
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,600
of "Don't ask, don't tell."

161
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,066
Thanks to these men,

162
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:34,333
we have the freedom
to be fierce.

163
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,934
And now, you get to exercise
that freedom

164
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:42,367
by enlisting these men
into your drag house.

165
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,934
- Oh, shit.

166
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:47,233
I'm nervous, 'cause I've never
done anyone else's makeup.

167
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,633
- Now, Alaska,
you won the mini challenge,

168
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:53,166
so you get to pair
the queens with their vets.

169
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,633
- Well, everything happens
for a reason...

170
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,900
- Uh-huh.

171
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,333
- And these men came in
in this order for a reason.

172
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,667
So I want to go straight down
the line, so--Izzy, is it?

173
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,767
- Yes.

174
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,266
- You are going to be
with Roxxxy Andrews.

175
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,734
- Alaska tells RuPaul,

176
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,667
"Everything happens
for a reason."

177
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,834
I think it was sabotage.

178
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,333
I thought we were closer
than this.

179
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,967
It pissed me off.

180
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,500
- Dave, you're going
to be with Jinkx Monsoon.

181
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,667
- Hi, Dave.

182
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,967
- You'll have so much fun
with Jinkx.

183
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,967
Jinkx is my biggest
competition right now,

184
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:28,567
so maybe it would be an
impediment having an older man.

185
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:32,567
Steve, you're going
to be with Coco.

186
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,800
- So big and strong.

187
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,133
- Aaron, you're going
to be with lady Detox.

188
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,934
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

189
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:42,166
- And, Alaska,
that means you have Mack.

190
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,100
- I think pairing myself
with the tall, pretty one

191
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,800
is probably
a really good strategy.

192
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,967
- Now, ladies,
we're gonna be looking

193
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,166
for a strong family resemblance.

194
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,734
A true expression of your drag.

195
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,400
Attention!

196
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,133
Gentlemen, start your engines.

197
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,900
And may the best woman...

198
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
win!

199
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,066
- So you've never,
ever been in drag before?

200
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,200
- No, I have not.

201
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,734
- Okay.

202
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,834
[laughs]

203
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:16,467
Who are some of your
diva inspirations?

204
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,100
- Uh...

205
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,500
Judy Garland.

206
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,233
- I can see us doing a Judy/Liza
kind of thing together.

207
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,233
- I knew Judy, by the way.

208
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,600
- You did?
- Yes.

209
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
- You knew Judy Garland?
What was she like?

210
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,667
- She was actually really nice.
- That's amazing.

211
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,066
I feel like the luckiest drag
queen in this room right now,

212
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,633
'cause I know these young guys
don't have stories like that.

213
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,300
And look, Detox
is more concerned

214
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,367
about sleeping with her, um...

215
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,400
- I can tell.

216
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,734
- Ha!

217
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,200
- Even though I got paired up
with the oldest vet,

218
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
I get to work
with one of the sweetest,

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,233
coolest people in the room.

220
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,400
- We have to give you body.
- Okay.

221
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,767
- Stand up for me.

222
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,900
- You can't tell in these pants,
but I have a big butt.

223
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,066
- Do you have a big butt?

224
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,767
That's perfect,
'cause I have a huge ass.

225
00:08:58,767 --> 00:08:59,734
Oh, it is a nice butt.

226
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,266
We're still gonna
make it bigger.

227
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,500
- I got a really hot guy.

228
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,066
Like, ah, Jesus.

229
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:07,967
He's really sweet, and a total
sissy, and I really like that.

230
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,400
I just want all you bitches
to pay attention really quick.

231
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,367
And let Aaron show you
how it's fucking done.

232
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,867
- Oh, my God,
she's done this before.

233
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:17,867
- I love it!

234
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,200
- I'm not happy at all.

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,567
Izzy is shorter

236
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:22,967
and he's hairy.

237
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,734
I'm pissed.

238
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:26,800
- Coming up...

239
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,166
Can we see a little bit
of her walk?

240
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,533
- Yeah.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.

241
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,967
- I got--I got it.

242
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,133
- Really?

243
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,567
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.

244
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,767
- [laughs]

245
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,133
[laughs]

246
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,500
- Today, we have to make over
our gay vet.

247
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,333
Have you ever worn Leg Avenue?

248
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,800
- [laughs]
No.

249
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,867
- And we have to do a complete
family resemblance runway look.

250
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,867
Is that the Michael Levine
fabric?

251
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,867
Oh, my God,
we're gonna be gorgeous.

252
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,266
[chuckles]

253
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,300
- Give me a little runway.

254
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,166
Oh, fuck.

255
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,567
- Oh, my God, hold on.
I got to see this.

256
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,066
You look like Jennifer Lopez
as Jesus.

257
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,433
[laughs]

258
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,133
- I got another thing comin'
for y'all.

259
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,533
I have a fuel under my ass.

260
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,767
He's going to be
drop-dead gorgeous.

261
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,834
- Get naked.

262
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,767
Let's try this on you.

263
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,033
I'm having a difficult time
working with my partner

264
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,667
because he's fucking beautiful.

265
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,066
[whistles]

266
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,734
So do you have a boyfriend
or anything?

267
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,400
- No.

268
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,133
- Thank you, gay God.

269
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,200
I just got lady wood
for you walking.

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
- If Detox doesn't
win this challenge,

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
she'll have no one
to blame but herself.

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,166
Here, put on these.
- Okay.

273
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,066
You got to understand
that bending over

274
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,600
can be a trip sometimes.

275
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,033
I have a medical condition.

276
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,166
In fact, I fell down
the other day.

277
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,066
- Dave's kind of top-heavy,

278
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,300
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around.

279
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,567
Hold my hand.

280
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,900
Focus on walking on your toes
a little bit more.

281
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,133
It's a distinct possibility
I'm going to be

282
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,100
in the bottom two tomorrow.

283
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,433
Okay.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.

284
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,333
- I got--I got it.
- You okay?

285
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,700
This big, buff man
in camouflage pants

286
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
and a pair of heels...

287
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,767
I never thought I'd be putting
a man's breasts on.

288
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,066
- [laughs]

289
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:22,266
- Oh, God, Steve,
we've got to pull this off.

290
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,900
'cause if I'm in the bottom two,
this may be my last supper.

291
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,066
- You haven't?
- Uh-uh.

292
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,633
- Well, how'd you
get yours, then?

293
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,066
- My friend made them for me.
- Oh.

294
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,867
- I've seen
a YouTube video of it.

295
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:43,066
All I have is a pair of scissors
and this really hard foam,

296
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:47,433
and so I'm just hoping
they'll look passable.

297
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:50,266
What inspired you to, like,
get into the military?

298
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,600
- I grew up in foster care,
and my 18th birthday,

299
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,066
my foster mom was like,

300
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,600
"You have to find a place
to live.

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,867
I'll give you a week."

302
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,700
and so I joined the military,

303
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,433
and I got out of it structure,
discipline...

304
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,567
- Wow.

305
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,400
- And now I'm ready
to be out on my own.

306
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,433
- It shows a great
amount of wisdom.

307
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:12,467
He said, "My life needs order
that I never got."

308
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,433
It's very admirable.

309
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,600
All right, now remember,
you're a woman, not a man.

310
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,500
Walk softly.

311
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,066
Mack is walking
like a Mack truck driver.

312
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,266
Ladies take soft steps.

313
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,600
Any advantage I thought I had

314
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,433
because of Mack's appearance
completely vanishes

315
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,100
because of the way
that he is holding himself.

316
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,500
- Hello, hello, hello.

317
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
all: Hi, Ru.

318
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,567
- Oh, dear, I see
lots of titties up in here.

319
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,333
Hello, Jinkx and Dave.

320
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,734
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.

321
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,233
- How's it going over here?

322
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,667
- He and I decided we're going
to do a Judy and Liza tribute.

323
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,767
- Oh, my goodness.

324
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,266
- And I've got the backstory.

325
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,467
- Tell me about that.

326
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,667
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.

327
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,867
[record needle scratch effect]

328
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,400
We were talking
one night at dinner,

329
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,500
and she asked me
about the new sleeping pills

330
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,800
that were out.

331
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,767
I told her about a new one,

332
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:18,100
and she died of an overdose.

333
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,734
- Dave has got Ru speechless.

334
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:24,100
How do you respond to, "I think
I killed Judy Garland"?

335
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,533
He's a monsoon, all right.

336
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,700
- Well, you know, Dave, she
worked real hard to get there.

337
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,467
All right, listen,
you kids get back to work,

338
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,066
and I can't wait to see ya.
- Thank you.

339
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,200
- Yeah.
- All right.

340
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
House of Alaska.

341
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,467
Mack has big, old titties,
no makeup,

342
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,066
and your skin is perfect.

343
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,667
- Oh, you haven't seen
my walk yet.

344
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,867
- Well, right, uh...

345
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,433
- Can we see a little bit of it?

346
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,333
- It's a work in progress.

347
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,567
It's hard breaking
the man out of Mack.

348
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,800
- Really?

349
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,934
The Armed Services
pushed it inside of you.

350
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,166
I--that came out wrong.

351
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,333
- [laughs]

352
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,800
- You have a lot of work to do.

353
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,734
You better sissy
that walk, Mack.

354
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:07,834
- You got it, Ru.

355
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,667
- I'll see you guys later.

356
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,433
Detox and Aaron.

357
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,667
Oh, my goodness,
you are working on it already.

358
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,700
- Hi, Ru.

359
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,333
She's my little baby doll.

360
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,834
The first thing
out of her mouth was,

361
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,066
"I need to put shoes on now,"

362
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,100
and she's been sissying
that walk up and down

363
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,266
this entire workroom.

364
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,233
- Good, good.
- [laughs]

365
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:26,233
- So, Aaron,
Don't Ask Don't Tell--

366
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,233
how has that
affected your life?

367
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,066
- I've served before and after.

368
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:32,600
And serving before,
it was tough, because I was,

369
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,233
you know, 22 and living
in the Castro,

370
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,900
and, like, gay, gay, gay.

371
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,266
- Yeah.

372
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,533
- And it was such culture shock
coming back in the closet.

373
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,600
- What's it like now?

374
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,066
- It takes
a little weight off you.

375
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,066
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,467
- And it's nice to be able to,

377
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,233
without fear of repercussion,
just really be that person.

378
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,300
- I'm so happy that
you are here with us,

379
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
and that you are out and proud,
and I cannot wait to see you.

380
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,600
- Me too.
- Thank you, Ru.

381
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,200
- See ya.
- Bye.

382
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
- The house of Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.

383
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,100
- Now, you've got some
wide hips, there.

384
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,533
Have you done drag before?

385
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,133
- No, never, Ru.
- Never.

386
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,633
- I feel, like,
how do they do that?

387
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,266
I mean, you guys got balls,
seriously.

388
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,367
- Oh, yeah, we do have balls.

389
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,600
- [laughs]

390
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
- Steve, now what made you
join the military?

391
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,433
- I always had an issue with
my--with being homosexual.

392
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,800
It was a way for me
to become straight.

393
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,967
I thought I would go in there,
they'll buff you up,

394
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,300
and yell at you.

395
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,567
- When you hear that,
you think about the other guys

396
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,767
that did it too.

397
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,700
Why can't people just let people
be who they are?

398
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,166
- I was young, I was stupid...
- Yeah.

399
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,233
- The Marines did teach me,
you know, how to be a man,

400
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,333
and how to not take things
so seriously.

401
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,333
- A lot like drag.

402
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,367
- Now, let me tell ya,
Coco needs your help.

404
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,767
She was in the bottom two
last week.

405
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,734
- Ya gotta bring that up, Ru?
Really?

406
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,734
- She's counting on you

407
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,734
to be a fierce queen.

408
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:48,934
- [laughs]

409
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,400
- All right, kids,
get back to it.

410
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,934
I will see you
on the main stage.

411
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,600
- Bye, Ru.

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,734
- Roxxxy and Izzy--now, Izzy,

413
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,467
have you ever done drag before?

414
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,567
- Never.

415
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,500
- Have you ever worn heels
before?

416
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,834
- Never.

417
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:05,967
- So are you gonna show a little
of the--[clicks tongue]

418
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,633
You know, 'cause that's what
the Andrews are famous for.

419
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,667
Do you have any peanut butter?

420
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,900
- No.

421
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,066
- [sighs]

422
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,567
- What's the biggest challenge,

423
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,867
in this challenge, for you?

424
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,834
- I want to make sure that
whatever I'm making her,

425
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,333
that she is gonna feel
comfortable 100%.

426
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,300
- Well, I'll let you
get back to it, okay?

427
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,767
- Okay.

428
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,734
By no way, shape, or form do I
think I'm done and feeling good.

429
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:32,100
- All right,
gather round, everybody!

430
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,967
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,

431
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,734
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges,

432
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:40,867
two men who know
a lot about makeovers.

433
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,967
From<i> What Not To Wear,</i>
Clinton Kelly will be here.

434
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,166
[cheers and applause]

435
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:50,066
And from<i> The Fashion Police,</i>
George Kotsiopoulos.

436
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,800
[cheers and applause]

437
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,900
Oh, and one more little thing.

438
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,633
In addition to
walking the runway,

439
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,066
each team needs to come up with

440
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:03,200
a patriotic
color guard presentation.

441
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,567
So raise your flag high

442
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,867
and don't fuck it up.

443
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,066
Coming up...

444
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:14,100
- Mack is extremely manly.

445
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,367
- Oh!

446
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,667
We don't know what the fuck
we're doing.

447
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,834
- [laughs]

448
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,800
[laughs]

449
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,266
- How do you feel at it?
- I feel alive.

450
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:29,100
- Our main challenge today
is to make gay veterans

451
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,600
into part of our drag family,

452
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,734
and to come up with a color
guard routine

453
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,934
to present on the runway.

454
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:38,967
Hmm, hmm, three...

455
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,200
- Oh, fuck.

456
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,166
- We don't know
what the fuck we're doing.

457
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,834
We haven't really
planned anything,

458
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:47,100
we're kind of making it up
as we go.

459
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,200
Oh!

460
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,066
[laughs]

461
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,166
Closer.

462
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,700
[sighs]

463
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,066
Do you have any ideas?

464
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,500
- Turn, turn, turn.

465
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,433
And turn around.
- Turn around.

466
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,533
- Don't fall, don't fall.

467
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:03,066
- I won't fall, I'm good.

468
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,433
- Those shoes
are killing you, huh?

469
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:08,333
Steve is determined to do
his rehearsal in these heels,

470
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,800
but the aches and pains
are all over his face.

471
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,700
Ah!
- Shut up.

472
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,567
- I think as much as Steve
wants to be prepared

473
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,367
for what it takes
to be in these heels...

474
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:18,433
Take 'em off.

475
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,467
Yeah, just take 'em off.

476
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,633
I don't think
he was ready for this.

477
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,166
- Oh, uh-uh.
- No?

478
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,567
- Oh, no, baby.

479
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm gonna fall off of these.

480
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,934
- Are they too high?
- Yeah.

481
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,967
- I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

482
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,400
- I mean, I do have
a medical condition, you know?

483
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
- What's that?

484
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,767
- I will be honest with you.

485
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:48,734
And, uh, I took a medicine, and
it caused me to look like this.

486
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:51,133
It also wasted the muscles
in my legs.

487
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
I just can't hold myself up.

488
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,467
- Okay. We're gonna
find a way to work with it.

489
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:03,633
- Okay.

490
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,367
- I mean, there's a million
and one things

491
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,100
we can do to overcome this.

492
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,166
And we're a team.

493
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,967
You're not in this alone.

494
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,066
- I'll be right back.

495
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:18,633
- [whimpers]

496
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:21,133
Dave is surviving with HIV,

497
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,533
and his body went through

498
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,333
a massive transformation,

499
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,900
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around,

500
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,567
let alone walk in heels,
but Dave's heart is so in it

501
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,367
that he wants
to give it his all.

502
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:38,166
We're gonna work with it,
not against you.

503
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,934
- Pop that foam, girl.
Pop that foam.

504
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,066
Hey, how you doin'?

505
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,100
[laughter]

506
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
I love it.

507
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,533
And...

508
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,367
Can we do that together, though?

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,333
- I'm just scared.

510
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,800
I'm scared, I'm scared,
I'm scared.

511
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,300
- All right.

512
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,633
I don't know what color guard
or flag twirling is.

513
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,233
So let's start
from sword fighting.

514
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,667
- And then like that,
and then what if I took

515
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,333
this one away
and then touched yours?

516
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,533
And then, you pull it back.
You're, like... [groans]

517
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:30,800
[laughs]

518
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,967
Like you just touched my dick,
or my sword fantasy,

519
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,700
whatever you call it.

520
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,367
- Well.

521
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,000
We're figuring it out
a lot on the fly.

522
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,033
[mimics marching music]

523
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,200
Um...

524
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,266
and then what?

525
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,233
- Dave is using the flag
as a cane,

526
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:52,333
both for comedic
and practical reasons,

527
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,900
but I choreographed our piece

528
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,934
to be well within
his capability.

529
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,066
Come on, Mama!

530
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,266
Come on!

531
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:01,767
And give the Judy Garland
a little swagger.

532
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,633
I have been trying to pull away
from camp and schtick

533
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:08,533
in this competition,
but I would rather him be safe

534
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,467
than try to lay all this
complicated choreography on him.

535
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,800
It's me and my mama!
- [laughs]

536
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
- Do one around.
- Uhh!

537
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,867
- Mama,
your skirt's falling down!

538
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,967
- I know.

539
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,767
- Oh, Mama!

540
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:25,400
Tomorrow, I wanna win
for Dave's sake.

541
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,767
- It is time to become women.

542
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,066
- Let's do this.

543
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,500
- Ready or not, here comes Mama!

544
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,967
- Today's elimination day.

545
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,967
I have a bunch of things
to do with Izzy.

546
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,834
We have to get him shaven.

547
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,667
It's time to get some clippers
and get this hair off of him.

548
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,734
[razor vibrates]

549
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,834
Blah! Uhh!
I hate body hair.

550
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,800
- [laughs]

551
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,233
- Fish, dude.

552
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:53,700
Let's get this chest.

553
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,500
Izzy turned out to be an angel.

554
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
He knows that whatever
he has to do to help us win,

555
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,867
he's gonna do it.

556
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,400
He's definitely being a trooper,
no pun intended.

557
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,500
[laughter]

558
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,667
[spits]

559
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,567
You're the only hairy one here?

560
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,700
That's okay 'cause guess what?
We can get rid of hair.

561
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
They can't get rid
of those faces.

562
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,700
- Exactly.

563
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,533
- All makeup, no talent.

564
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,066
- "All makeup, no talent"?

565
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,734
Is that what you're saying,
Coco?

566
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,400
Coco and Steve are throwing
a lot of shade,

567
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,467
but let's see when
the faces come out,

568
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:25,500
'Cause Coco don't know
how to paint faces.

569
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,400
- She's making you a black girl.

570
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,266
- I am not!
- You are, girl!

571
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,767
- All that makeup on his face!

572
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,834
- [laughs]

573
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,066
- Get the fuck away from me,
Detox.

574
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,700
Shit.

575
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,767
I don't paint
other people's face.

576
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,767
That's not something
you can learn overnight,

577
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,233
and I got a few hours.

578
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:46,667
- Horchata looks like a cross
between one of the Jackson 5s

579
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,834
and a member from<i> Cats.</i>

580
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,200
- Oh, shit.

581
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,166
I look scary.

582
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,333
- Am I doing this right?

583
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,133
You know I don't know
how to glue down brows.

584
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,400
Sweetie, we're in a competition.

585
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,834
I can't help you
or your manly man.

586
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,100
- But look how pretty he is.

587
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,233
- Tell me what happened
when you were discovered

588
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:06,734
to be a homosexual
in the service.

589
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,500
- The house that I had
in Washington, D.C.,

590
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,433
we had four of us,
two Marines and two sailors.

591
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,834
We decided we wanted to go
to our favorite gay bar

592
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:19,567
in full uniform, what we called
"high drag" in those days.

593
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,467
There was a spy.

594
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,233
It got back to the base,
and all four of us

595
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:27,066
were put on notice that
we were going to be discharged

596
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,867
for being gay.

597
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,133
- He's been through everything
that you could guess

598
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,700
a 67-year-old gay veteran

599
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,967
could have possibly
been through.

600
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,900
- One of the boys ended up
being court-martialed

601
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,734
because, in those days,
it was illegal to be gay,

602
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,467
and he ended up in Leavenworth
ward for a year.

603
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,934
- It's so important
to learn about the struggles

604
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,967
that people like Dave have been
through to get us the rights

605
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,066
that we take for granted.

606
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,767
- So that car accident
that you were in--

607
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,233
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened there?

608
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:02,500
- I was leaving a gig,
and apparently,

609
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,667
there was this guy who got
kicked out of the bar.

610
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,734
He left his car parked
in the middle of the freeway

611
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,233
with no lights on
and was sleeping in his car.

612
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:13,066
We just ran into him
going 80 or 90 miles an hour.

613
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,233
My face kind of ricocheted
off the windshield,

614
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:18,367
and I lost, like,
this part of my forehead.

615
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,166
I severed the main artery
in my head, and...

616
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,400
- Oh, my God.

617
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,700
- Like, almost bled out
in a matter of minutes.

618
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,834
- Jesus Christ.

619
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,300
Did that change anything
about you?

620
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,800
- I didn't leave the house
for, like, two months

621
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,367
because I just felt like
such a Frankenstein.

622
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:39,266
After the accident,
it was pretty traumatizing

623
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:41,066
because I was in the hospital
for so long,

624
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,166
and I was really weak.

625
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,800
I was so depressed.

626
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,133
I would go visit drag shows,

627
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,066
and they really kinda
pulled me out of that,

628
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,900
and, were, like,
"Just get back into it, girl.

629
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,367
You look fine, you'll be good."

630
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:53,133
Getting back into doing drag and
throwing myself into my work

631
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,066
really helped me,

632
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:57,667
but I still can't
grow eyebrows on this side.

633
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,166
Luckily, I can paint them on.

634
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,667
[snickers]

635
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,633
I just pull it down
and then take the rest

636
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:07,633
of your weed whacker
and pull it all the way back.

637
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:08,934
- That's not gonna hurt?

638
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,800
- No, just try it.
- [laughs]

639
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,500
- Now, what do you tape it to?

640
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,066
- You pull the tape
up to your butt.

641
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,633
[tape ripping]

642
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:18,066
It's time for Steve to tuck,

643
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,367
and this is a process.

644
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,066
A very long process.

645
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,867
How the fuck do you do this?

646
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,700
The bucket's slipping out.

647
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,867
- Do I have to come back there
and put it up for you?

648
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,433
'Cause I will.

649
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,233
- Oh, looks like camel toe.

650
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,767
- Camel toe is in this season.

651
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:37,834

Can't walk in it.

654
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:42,066
- Coming up...

655
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,834
- You were making
major missteps.

656
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,133
- And that was not glamorous.

657
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,166
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.

658
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:50,467
- Just show us a smile
from time to time.

659
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,433

Now, are you excited to be here?

683
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,066
- This is more exciting
than the Academy Awards.

Are you kidding me?
- [laughs]

685

00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,800
- So happy to have you here.

687
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,567
This week, we challenged our
queens to earn their stripes

688
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,767
by transforming gay veterans

689
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:01,066
into members
of their drag family.

690
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,500
Gentlemen, start your engines

691
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,066
and may the best woman win.

692
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,667
- Immediately, I drop a flag.

693
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,734
Bam!

694
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,200
Fuck.

695
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,867
- Our flag routine is fun,

696
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:35,100
goofy, and weird, just like me.

697
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,066
- Horchata is turning it out.

698
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,133
She's smiling.
She's buckin'.

699
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:44,367
She's doing her thing.

700
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,066
- Every time I looked over
at Isabella,

701
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,066
she was doing exactly
what she needed to do.

702
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,934
Could not have gone any better.

703
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,100
I think we might
pull through tonight.

704
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,367
- Commence shakedown.

705
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,100
- Ladies, forward march.

706
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,367
From the house of Monsoon,

707
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,333
Jinkx and Fortuna.

708
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,066
- Judy looks more like Liza
these days.

709
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,667
- Yes!

710
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,900
- We are serving mama
and gypsy realness.

711
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,400
I think we really hit the nail
on the head with this one.

712
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,333
Meet me in the middle
and give 'em a little hip!

713
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,200
Here we go, and, oh!

714
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,266
You got it!

715
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:44,300
[laughter]

716
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,734
Now, that's enter-taint-ment.

717
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:50,567
The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.

718
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,200
- That's the Andrews sisters.

719
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,567
- Uh-huh.

720
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,834
- Bam!

721
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,233
- The look on Izzy's face--
she is feeling it.

722
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,200
She is loving it.

723
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Yeah, bitches, get into it.

724
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
- The missing Kardashian
sisters.

725
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,333
- Big booties
must run in the family.

726
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,734
- Yeah.

727
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:07,300
- The house of Alaska

728
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,567
featuring
Alaska and Nebraska,

729
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:11,700
cat burglars.

730
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,367
- Okay, that's more
like Miss Nebraska

731
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,967
'cause she is a beauty queen.

732
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,233
- Yes.

733
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,467
- We're feeling good.

734
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:19,066
We're skipping down the runway.

735
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:21,667
I'm very proud
of little Nebraska.

736
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,533
- I didn't know Patty Hearst
had daughters.

737
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,567
- Uh-huh.

738
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,667
[laughter]

739
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:31,934
- The house of Detox:
Detox and Bethadone,

740
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:34,100
hunting for red October.

741
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,967
- Bethadone and I are stomping
it out and being playful,

742
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,066
and you can just tell that
he's living for himself,

743
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:41,533
which is the purpose
of this whole challenge.

744
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,066
- America the booty-ful.

745
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:46,967
Lucky for these girls,
it's fleet week.

746
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,834
The house of Montrese!

747
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:52,467
Coco and Horchata Montrese.

748
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,367
Mm, I'm thirsty.

749
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:57,066
- Horchata's giving you nothing
but pure showgirl,

750
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,066
and I'm giving you
nothing but red carpet,

751
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,266
Montrese-style.

752
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,266
- Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

753
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:07,700
- Is that your boa, or are you
just ready to flock me?

754
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,867
- [laughs]

755
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:10,967
Coming up...

756
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,700
- The boots are just
unforgivable.

757
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,133
I hate them.

758
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:17,834
- Those pads, it looks like
there's hams in there.

759
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:21,233
- You seem very upset.
- It was a shit show.

760
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:24,266
- [laughs]

761
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,600
Welcome, ladies!

762
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,300
First up, the house of Monsoon,

763
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,633
Jinkx and Fortuna.

764
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,433
Dave, let's take a look
at your before.

765
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:40,166
And look at you now.

766
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,200
- As complicated
as your choreography was,

767
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,467
you were both in sync
with one another,

768
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,567
and it wasn't overly complicated
where you were dropping things

769
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,767
or making major missteps.

770
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,133
- You did have
a very difficult task

771
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,667
dressing someone in their 60s,

772
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,633
and I actually wouldn't change
anything about the styling.

773
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,300
I think you guys look
incredible.

774
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,233
- Well, Dave, I'm honored
to have you here,

775
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:05,066
especially since you're one of
the queens from back in the day.

776
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,834
- I thought you were gonna say
"The oldest."

777
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:07,867
- [laughs]

778
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,934
- That would be Michelle.

779
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,767
[laughter]

780
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,867
- Up next:
The house of Andrews,

781
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:17,133
Roxxxy and Isabella.

782
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,100
Now, this is Izzy before,

783
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,934
and this is Isabella.

784
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,633
So how do you feel, Izzy?

785
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,567
- I feel like I could give
Santino a mustache ride.

786
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,200
- [shouts]

787
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
- Come on with it!

788
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,934
- One thing about
the house of Andrews:

789
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,900
We're hos, miss thang, and this
one came right into it.

790
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,433
- You are absolutely gorgeous.

791
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,367
I love that you did
the traditional Andrews ass,

792
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,900
and you really look like
family members.

793
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,200
- Wow.

794
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,166
- You were in perfect unison
for most of the routine,

795
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,767
which was really fun,
and, Isabella,

796
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,533
that booty shake was seriously
grade A.

797
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,533
I mean,
I could not get over that.

798
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,934
- Next up,
from the house of Alaska,

799
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,166
Alaska, the 49th state,

800
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,500
and Nebraska, the 37th state.

801
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,834
- Ohh.

802
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,066
- Mack, let's take a look
at your before picture,

803
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:04,834
and let's take
a look at you now.

804
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,200
Ooh, ooh!

805
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,934
Nebraska, tell me about
the challenge.

806
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,266
What was the hardest part?

807
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:11,367
- I was a little bit
uncomfortable at the beginning,

808
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,467
and as soon as she
brought out the weapons

809
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,700
and I was in the gear,
I was ready for battle.

810
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,066
- Stop using sex
as a weapon, Nebraska.

811
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,300
- [laughs]

812
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,967
- Well, didn't you get
the pretty pearl?

813
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:24,934
I mean, Nebraska came out,
and I was, like, "Whoa!"

814
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:27,633
The flag routine
didn't really come off

815
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:28,700
the way you wanted it to.

816
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,333
I think there were things
out of sync

817
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,934
and falling apart
here and there.

818
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,567
- Those hip pads, I mean,

819
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,433
it looks like there's
hams in there.

820
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:38,800
- You had, like,
the perfect model to work with,

821
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,367
and it just makes me sad
to see lumpy padding,

822
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,066
and the boots
are just unforgivable.

823
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,500
I just hate--I hate them.

824
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,967
- All right.
Next up: The house of Detox,

825
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,767
Detox and Bethadone.

826
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:53,934
- Hello.

827
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,667
- This is Aaron before,

828
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,333
and look at you now.

829
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,900
So, Bethadone, what was tougher:

830
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,433
Basic training
or getting up into drag?

831
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:03,700
- I'm definitely gonna
have to say basic training...

832
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,767
[laughter]

833
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,667
But this definitely wasn't easy.

834
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,200
- I'm interested in why Detox
put that bow in the front

835
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,633
after we read Roxxxy
down for that.

836
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,667
- Oh, 'cause I don't
pay attention to Roxy.

837
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,900
[laughter]

838
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,700
- But you should
pay attention to critiques.

839
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,467
- That performance,
you dropped the flag.

840
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:21,834
They got twisted up.

841
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,834
God, it was just--

842
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,734
- It was a shit show.

843
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,834
- Bethadone looked like
she was having a lot of fun.

844
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,066
She was really smiling,

845
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:29,934
and you didn't seem to be
having as much fun.

846
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:32,066
Just show us a smile
from time to time.

847
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,066
- All right, next up:
The house of Montrese,

848
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:37,066
Coco and Horchata.

849
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:41,333
Now, this is Steve before,
and look at you now.

850
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,900
Steve, what was the hardest part
of it for you?

851
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,967
- The heels and the makeup.

852
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,200
- Good, then, it's working.

853
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,467
- [chuckles]

854
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:50,500
- You guys really went
for, like, the Olympics here

855
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,233
with your flag routines.

856
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:54,133
It's not necessary.

857
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,934
- I can tell
that you've never done

858
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,934
someone else's hair and makeup.

859
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:00,567
There's subtle blending
and highlighting

860
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,066
that you didn't do.

861
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:05,900
- And the irregular hem makes
it seem like you made a gown

862
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,066
for yourself and you gave
your sister the scraps

863
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:11,066
that were kind of left over.

864
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,066
- You seem very upset.

865
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:15,066
- It seems like every week,
I'm letting you down,

866
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:16,767
letting you down,
letting you down.

867
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:22,467
- Listen, it's part of the game
of being criticized by judges.

868
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,166
I've been in front of any kind
of critic you can imagine.

869
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,633
Have fun with it.

870
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:30,467
As an entertainer, you know
that if you're not having fun,

871
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,400
the audience doesn't have fun.

872
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,967
You just gotta remember that.

873
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:38,834
I'm so proud that we got
to share this with these fellas

874
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,900
from the military
and showing them

875
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,867
what they were fighting for.

876
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,734
They don't tell them that
when they enroll,

877
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:48,800
that you're fighting for our
freedom to dress up in drags.

878
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,767
This is a fabulous country!

879
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:55,266
And I'm so proud, right now,
to be an American citizen.

880
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,533
All right, a little ki-ki
on the stage.

881
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,734
- Ohh!

882
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,066
- Thank you, ladies,
and thank you, veterans.

883
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,433
Now, while you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

884
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,500
the judges and I
will deliberate.

885
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:12,066
All right, now, just between us
civilians, what do you think?

886
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:15,667
Jinkx Monsoon and Fortuna.

887
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,567
- When she and Fortuna came out
with their flag routine,

888
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,567
I thought, "Jinkx is going
to be in the bottom,"

889
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:23,266
but I have to tell you,
she made up for it and then some

890
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:26,066
with her mother-daughter Gypsy
Rose Lee and Mama routine.

891
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:30,533
- My only criticism would be
that Dave is 67,

892
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:33,567
but Fortuna looks
a little bit older than that.

893
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,767
- The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.

894
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,900
- It wasn't too complicated,
but what they did do,

895
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,967
it was well practiced,
well rehearsed.

896
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,934
Roxy did a bang-up job.

897
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,233
- Well, I love the Mini-Me vibe
that they were giving out,

898
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:47,367
and oh, my God,

899
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,233
they should just win
on that padding alone

900
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,233
because I didn't even know
it was padding.

901
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,533
It was amazing.

902
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:55,133
- What did you think of house
of Alaska and Nebraska?

903
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:57,600
- I think Alaska
needs to work on her craft.

904
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,200
That transformation
was really weak

905
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,500
compared to
what she had to work with.

906
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,567
- I was not as compelled
by Alaska

907
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,600
as I was by Nebraska,

908
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,166
and I think that's a problem.

909
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:12,934
- Moving on to the house
of Detox and Bethadone.

910
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:16,233
- The complicated flag twirling
was a mess, seriously.

911
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:18,300
- They look like deranged
Raggedy Ann dolls,

912
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,700
and I'm just questioning
whether or not

913
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,400
there's a taste level there.

914
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,433
- Coco and Horchata Montrese.

915
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,266
- Poor Horchata.
I mean, poor, poor Horchata.

916
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,467
- That was not glamorous.

917
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,467
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.

918
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:33,533
You know, I'm thinking Coco
might need to go

919
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:34,600
back to beauty school.

920
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,700
- The flag show was a disaster,

921
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,633
and she would never
let herself go out

922
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,500
with a busted-up face like that.

923
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,800
- Never, ever.
- No?

924
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,834
- Please.
- It was like Frida Kahlo.

925
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,066
It was a giant eyebrow
walking down the stage.

926
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,166
- Silence!

927
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,900
I've made my decision.

928
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,633
Bring back the girls.

929
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:55,667
[laughs]

930
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,333
Welcome back, ladies.

931
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,567
I've made some decisions.

932
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:05,934
Jinkx Monsoon, your Liza
and Judy-inspired drag

933
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,533
took us over the rainbow.

934
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,066
You're safe.

935
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,066
- Thank you.

936
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,734
- I'm safe.

937
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:19,066
- Roxxxy Andrews, you set out
to turn a salty seaman

938
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,834
into your sexy sister.

939
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,967
Mission accomplished.

940
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:26,166
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

941
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,934
[applause]

942
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:30,734
- Girl, you won!

943
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:36,100
- You and your drag sister have
each won a shopping spree

944
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,867
at American Apparel.

945
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,400
Izzy can decide
if he wants to shop

946
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,066
in the men's
or the women's department.

947
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,233
- Female.

948
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,300
- Gah!

949
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,767
This is my second win.

950
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,266
Finally.

951
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,600
- Coco Montrese.

952
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,066
Tonight, you didn't give us
what we were thirsty for.

953
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

954
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,867
- Oy.
- Oy.

955
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,266
- [speaks Spanish]

956
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:05,767
- For the fourth time,
doesn't look too good.

957
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:09,200
- Alaska, your cross-country
crime spree

958
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,533
didn't steal the show.

959
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:15,834
Detox, your Marine makeover

960
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,467
hit a snafu.

961
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

962
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,600
Alaska, you may join
the other girls.

963
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,667
- Thank you.

964
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,066
- Two queens stand before me.

965
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,700
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

966
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,300
a lip-synch performance
of<i> (it takes) Two</i>

967
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,266
by Seduction featuring
Michelle Visage.

968
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:44,266
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me

969
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:47,967
and save yourself
from elimination.

970
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,967
The time has come

971
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,066
for you to lip-synch

972
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,066
for your life.

973
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,700
- On a scale of one to ten,

974
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,066
my lip-synching
is probably a 25.

975
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:03,200
- Ready, set, go.
Let's do this.

976
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,300
- Good luck,

977
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,400

[cheers and applause]

1023
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,967
- Ladies, I've made my decision.

1024
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,834
Detox, shante, you stay.

1025
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,266
You may join the other girls.

1026
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:49,033
- I'm sorry.

1027
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,600
- Coco Montrese,

1028
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,700
I want you to hear this.

1029
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,066
You never let me down,

1030
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:57,834
and I am cuckoo for Coco.

1031
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:00,700
Now sashay away.

1032
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,533
- [crying]
Thank you.

1033
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,667
[whispers]
Thank you.

1034
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,900
- Thank you.

1035
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,900
[indistinct chatter]

1036
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,834
- This is one of the most
amazing experiences of my life.

1037
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,500
I did my best.

1038
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,767
I think Alyssa and I can put
the past behind us.

1039
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,367
I gained a lot of closure, which
I probably would have never got

1040
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:26,800
if it wasn't for RuPaul,
so I'm very happy.

1041
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,433
- My fab four.

1042
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,600
Condragulations.

1043
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,433
Victory is yours!

1044
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:35,066
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1045
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,800
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1046
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,266
Can I get an amen in here?

1047
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,734
all: Amen.

1048
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:43,066
- All right,
now let the music play.

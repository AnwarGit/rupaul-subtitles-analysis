To dismiss me, right now,

on their part

Now, you'll be writing lyrics
in three teams.

&gt;&gt; Ah!

529
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,967
&gt;&gt; Whoo!

530
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,066
&gt;&gt; "Love yourself."

531
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,667
&gt;&gt; That was so much fun.

532
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,567
&gt;&gt; Girl, I thought you was about
to go off.

533
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,066
&gt;&gt; No, girl.

534
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,800
&gt;&gt; Do you feel like
she was instigating it?

535
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,767
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

536
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,734
And then try to play like,

537
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,433
"Oh, I didn't do anything."

538
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,400
&gt;&gt; What's the "T"?

539
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.

540
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,734
I'm totally fine.

541
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,300
&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking if
you're gonna say my name,

542
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,467
you've been throwing
dust and shade.

543
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,900
&gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you."

544
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,800
All I said was,
"Thank you, Detox."

545
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for
what though, miss thing?

546
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
&gt;&gt; Well, she feels like
you were instigating.

547
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,667
&gt;&gt; I wasn't instigating shit.

548
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,033
I'm not trying to be dusty.

549
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,233
I'm not trying to sabotage
anybody in this competition.

550
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,166
If you feel that way,
I'm sorry you feel that way,

551
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,867
'cause that's not the case.

552
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,367
&gt;&gt; I'm giving dust,
I'm giving this.

553
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,400
I ain't said a word.

554
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,367
I'm just standing here.

555
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,467
&gt;&gt; You haven't said a word,

556
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,934
but you said a lot to Alyssa
this whole--

557
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,500
&gt;&gt; I don't need y'all
to gang up on me.

558
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,700
You, you, or you.

559
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,200
&gt;&gt; Miss thing, I'm not ganging
up on anybody.

560
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,233
&gt;&gt; I don't need that.

561
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,633
&gt;&gt; I'm not ganging up
on anybody.

562
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:45,633
&gt;&gt; I said what I had to say.

563
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:47,033
&gt;&gt; When you're on stage
and you say,

564
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,600
"Thank you, detox,"
snotty like that--

565
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,266
when I see this and I see
eyeballs flying at me,

566
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,467
I'm gonna fucking say something.

567
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,934
&gt;&gt; Girl, I didn't even
look at you.

568
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,033
Who eyeballs were flying at you?

569
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,734
'Cause my eyeballs
didn't fly nowhere.

570
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:58,000
&gt;&gt; Coco always wants to say
that she's very positive

571
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,700
and looks at the best
of everything.

572
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,734
&gt;&gt; Oh, my god.

573
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,934
&gt;&gt; Yet she's been
playing the victim

574
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,066
the last couple of weeks,

575
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,800

pretty much over it.

580

&gt;&gt; The theme for today's runway
is "best body part."

581
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:24,066
It's imperative for me to burn
the building with the look,

582
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,834
because Coco wasn't herself,

583
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,900
I'm not a singer,

584
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,633

I've had so much done
to my body,

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I might as well show it off.

590
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,467
&gt;&gt; What all have you had done?

591
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:42,233
&gt;&gt; I have had a little bit
of plastic surgery

592
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,166
here and there.

593
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,400
I've had my hips
and my ass done.

594
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,066
I've had my pecs done.

595
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,433
Underneath my eyes done
and my brow area done.

596
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,600
My six-pack done.

597
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,066
&gt;&gt; You've had a six-pack done
with silicone?

598
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,066
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

599
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,734
My cheeks done and my lips done.

600
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,166
My chin done,
and my jawline done.

601
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,133
My shoulders, I've had--

602
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,633
&gt;&gt; Your shoulders?

603
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,533
&gt;&gt; My muscles are all silicone.

604
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,066
And then I've had a little bit
done on my bicep here.

605
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,433
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
You're a silicone maniac.

606
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,834
&gt;&gt; The only thing I haven't
had done

607
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:12,066
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.

608
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,533
I'm like walking tupperware,

609
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,967

&gt;&gt; How do I feel about queens

612
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,834
who've had plastic surgery?

613
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,400
Jealous.

614
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
If I had my way,

615
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,166
my upper lip would
look like this.

616
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,600
&gt;&gt; It wasn't
the most pleasant experience

617
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,633
for coming out for me.

618
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,600
[laughs]

619
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,100
&gt;&gt; Did you have anyone
in your family

620
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
who was supportive of you?

621
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,133
&gt;&gt; It really, like, ruined
my world for a while.

622
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,567
I had, like, really
dark times as a kid.

623
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,266
I parted from my family.

624
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:45,333
We parted on bad terms,

625
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,834
and I really just
didn't have anyone.

626
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:47,834
I didn't have any friends.

627
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,533
I didn't have anybody.

628
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,300
I was just very lost.

629
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,066
And I wasn't happy with myself.

630
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,233
&gt;&gt; You don't need to waste time

631
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,367

632
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,200
who aren't gonna accept you
for who you are.

633
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,233
&gt;&gt; Right.

634
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,367
And I think when you get older,

635
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,066
you just really appreciate
things so much more.

636
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,333
You know what I mean?

637
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,800
Like, I'm glad that--you
know, I don't regret anything.

638
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,500
I pride myself on
where I'm at now

639
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,133
and the person that I've become.

640
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,333
I'm much stronger,
and I love myself much more.

641
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,266
You know, when Ru says,
"You have to love yourself",

642
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,633
you definitely do, so...

643
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,066
'cause if you don't love
yourself,

644
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,800
how the hell are you gonna love
anyone else?

645
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,900
[laughs]

646
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,133

was trying to be

647
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,967

00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,433
&gt;&gt; The singing, it was a little
bit of a let down.

861
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:32,066
&gt;&gt; It was almost as if you were
dying for this song to get over.

862
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:34,400
&gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on
here,

863
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,633
hair coming out of the hips,
hair coming out of a boob.

864
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,433
What?

865
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:44,066
&gt;&gt; Next up, Ivy Winters.
&gt;&gt; Hi, mama.

866
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,333
&gt;&gt; I love your dress.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

867
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,467
&gt;&gt; Are those your pictures
on there?

868
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,200
&gt;&gt; They're all my face,
body shots.

869
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,266
&gt;&gt; Oh, that is so clever.

870
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,400
&gt;&gt; You can carry a tune as well.

871
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,667
I liked your harmonies the best.

872
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,934
You stood out.

873
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:58,900
&gt;&gt; Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.

874
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,333
&gt;&gt; I love the way you held that
long note.

875
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,400
That just put all the icing
on the cake for me.

876
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,066
&gt;&gt; Look, I'm gonna give you
a tip.

877
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:11,834
You don't need to contour
so hard.

878
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,900
Though we have
a touch of crazy in us,

879
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,834
you don't need to
look it.

880
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,667
&gt;&gt; Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.

881
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,800
One question.

882
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Is that your skin color?

883
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,734
Is that all painted on?

884
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:22,400
&gt;&gt; That's peanut butter.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

885
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,467
&gt;&gt; Peanut butter.

886
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,700
&gt;&gt; Peanut butter, peanut butter.

887
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,233
&gt;&gt; It was so hot from the moment
you stepped out there.

888
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,133
And when you threw that
cape off, it was on, honey.

889
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:33,200
&gt;&gt; In the video, as a group,

890
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,967
it was rough, because
no one was harmonizing

891
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,500
and it got
a little monotonous.

892
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,300
&gt;&gt; What's going on with you
and Detox?

893
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
&gt;&gt; Rolaskatox.

894
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,433
&gt;&gt; You got this little sisterly
thing going on?

895
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,066
&gt;&gt; We're just becoming
best of friends,

896
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:46,967
and Alaska as well.

897
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,967
&gt;&gt; Remember, this is
a competition.

898
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,233
Cliques can be dangerous.

899
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,500
&gt;&gt; All right, next up, Detox.

900
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,433
&gt;&gt; Stunning shape tonight,

901
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,233
and a real payoff
when you turned around.

902
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:59,333
&gt;&gt; I get worried about you
relying on crutches.

903
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:02,066
Last week you lip synched for
your life,

904
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,066
and you did
your little jaw thing,

905
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,066
and it's funny.

906
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,100
Let's not kill it.

907
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,066
&gt;&gt; All right.

908
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,100
Who's gonna ask her?

909
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,667
Al-as-ka!

910
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:11,800
&gt;&gt; Hi.

911
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,500
&gt;&gt; I loved the lyric
when you said,

912
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,567
I think it was,
"tuck my junk"?

913
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:16,867
Yeah, I--

914
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,533
How do you tuck your junk?

915
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,667
&gt;&gt; After the show,
I can show you.

916
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,734
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

917
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,600
&gt;&gt; I'm almost getting bored.

918
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,300
Something's missing, Alaska.

919
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,400
In your singing performance,

920
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,533
you were hiding behind glasses,

921
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,233
almost so we don't
get to see you.

922
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,500
I don't know why
you're holding back.

923
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,667
Don't worry about your group,

924
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,867
whoever you're with.

925
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,300
No!

926
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,600
Worry about you!

927
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,066
We want to see what Alaska has.

928
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,400
Bring it.

929
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,166
&gt;&gt; I get a sense that you hide
behind shticky character.

930
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,834
There's a level of vulnerability

931
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:52,066
that you're not allowing us
to see.

932
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,100
You are in a relationship with
Sharon Needles,

933
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,300
and she's got the shtick,

934
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,066
but there is a heart there.

935
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:01,900
And I want to get to the heart
of Alaska.

936
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,633
Are you hearing any of that?

937
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:07,500
&gt;&gt; I'm...

938
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,066
um, I need to show you
the real me

939
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:14,066
and--and show that
to you every time.

940
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,834
To hear that I don't have
a heart,

941
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,867
and I don't have vulnerability,

942
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,900
that's extremely hard
for me to hear.

943
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,667
&gt;&gt; All right, ladies,
while you untuck

944
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,767
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

945
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:29,066
the judges and I
will deliberate.

946
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,133
All right.

947
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,667
Just between us siblings,
what do you think?

948
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:37,066
Let's start with Coco Montrese.

949
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:39,667
&gt;&gt; Child, that highlighter
was higher and lighter

950
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,300
than I've seen in many a time.

951
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

952
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,633
&gt;&gt; I don't think she's focused,

953
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:44,700
and that's her problem.

954
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,934
The stronger people are gonna
take over

955
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,100
and win at the end of the day,

956
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,800
and that's what's happening
right here.

957
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
&gt;&gt; Alyssa Edwards.

958
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,834
&gt;&gt; I loved her look tonight.

959
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,667
She was showcasing legs
and face.

960
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,900
&gt;&gt; She does that walk.

961
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,100
Every time she goes somewhere,

962
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,133
she points to the...

963
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,433
&gt;&gt; Yes.

964
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,533
&gt;&gt; Spot she's gonna go to.
&gt;&gt; "I'm going over here."

965
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:00,567
"Now I'm going over here."

966
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,066
"Back here."
&gt;&gt; I love it.

967
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,967
&gt;&gt; Her singing was
a little off balance.

968
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,066
&gt;&gt; She's not a great singer.

969
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:10,533
Don't judge me!
Don't judge me!

970
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,667
&gt;&gt; But I think she compensated
for that with her movement.

971
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,100
&gt;&gt; Let's move on to Jade Jolie.

972
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,533
Oh, my goodness, that outfit.

973
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,066
&gt;&gt; It just was a miss
on so many levels.

974
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,300
I don't even know
where to begin.

975
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,066
&gt;&gt; I don't really remember
her vocals.

976
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:23,066
I guess I wasn't impressed.

977
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,834
&gt;&gt; Forgettable.
Just forgettable.

978
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:28,133
&gt;&gt; Moving on to Ivy Winters.

979
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,300
&gt;&gt; Tonight, on the runway,
was very creative.

980
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,900
&gt;&gt; I like when she added
the harmony to the song.

981
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,266
I thought that was very good.

982
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,900
&gt;&gt; The girl can sing.

983
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,600
She really surprised me.

984
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,300
&gt;&gt; Jinkx Monsoon.

985
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,767
&gt;&gt; There was, like, 20 different
eras going on tonight

986
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,700
in this glamour.

987
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
The belt was from the '80s,

988
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,333
the dress was, like, the '50s.

989
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,500
There are so many things
that are consistently a mess.

990
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,967
&gt;&gt; But she can sing.

991
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,500
Jinkx has some pipes.

992
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,600
&gt;&gt; Very strong and powerful.

993
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,066
Liked it very much.

994
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,066
&gt;&gt; Roxxxy Andrews.

995
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,066
&gt;&gt; When it comes to sexy,
she was the top for me.

996
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:00,066
&gt;&gt; She could not sing a lick,

997
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,700
and that did not stop her.

998
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,934
She was hilarious.

999
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:06,367
&gt;&gt; Moving on to Detox.

1000
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,600
&gt;&gt; She kind of phoned it in
in the song department.

1001
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,066
&gt;&gt; Can't remember
the performance.

1002
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,967
The dress just
took my mind away.

1003
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:13,967
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

1004
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,734
&gt;&gt; Crack is back,
and that was that.

1005
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:17,834
&gt;&gt; Alaska.

1006
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,100
&gt;&gt; Every time
she comes out here,

1007
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,533
she's got the same
little wiggle,

1008
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:21,767
the same little, "Hi."

1009
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:23,066
I'm bored.

1010
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:24,333
&gt;&gt; I think, truthfully,

1011
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,767
that she's given us all she has.

1012
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,066
Michelle, this is probably it.

1013
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,834
Remember,
we're paring everybody off,

1014
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,433
and the competition's getting
really strict and hard now.

1015
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,467
&gt;&gt; Silence!

1016
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:34,900
I've made my decision.

1017
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,567
Bring back my girls,
and, uh, can I get an amen?

1018
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,700
all: Amen.

1019
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,800
&gt;&gt; All right.

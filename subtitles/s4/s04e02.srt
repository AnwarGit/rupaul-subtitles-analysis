2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,133
you'll need to survive

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:08,667
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,066
The Rupocalypse.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,467
- [screams]

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,967
- Ooh, shit,
it's falling apart.

7
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,800
- Jiggly's costume
is a hot mess.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,500
- Jiggly Caliente...

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,633
Lashauwn Beyond...

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,266
The Princess, Sharon Needles.

11
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,834
- This is my kind of ghoul.

12
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,834
- Con-drag-ulations.

13
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,266
You are the winner
of this challenge.

14
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,367
- Thank you.

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,100
- I'm just in disbelief
that I'm here.

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,200
- Bitch, you're here.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,667
- Yeah, honey, you better snap
out of it.

18
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,667
Play to win.

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,934
Jiggly Caliente,
shantay, you stay.

20
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,266
- Thank you.

21
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:49,800
- Alisa Summers, sashay away.

22
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,800
And tonight...
you'll be transforming

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,300
yourselves into wrestling's

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,867
trashiest fighters.

25
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,433
The dolls throw down...

26
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,066
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.

27
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,066
Get out of here.

28
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,600
[audience oohing]

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,967
- And take flight.

30
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,066
- Chicago, bitch.

31
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,433
[screaming]

32
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,567
- With extra-special
guest judges

33
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,934
NBA stars Rick Fox
and John Salley.

The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

36
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,500
will receive a lifetime supply

And may the best woman win.

44
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,567
- A gorgeous day.

45
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,066
- Good morning, cluckers.

46
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,266
- We walk in the work room this

47
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,333
morning, and we see Alisa's

48
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,266
message, and it's kind of sad.

49
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,266
I mean, it was official.

50
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,700
Week by week, we're all going to

51
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,900
be going home.

52
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,333
- "Keep it cute, ladies!

53
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,166
"Shady sisters 4-ever!

54
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,900
Love, Alisa."

55
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,100
- Look what you've done.
- That's what you've done, baby.

56
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,967
- It was either her or me,
and I was not going home.

57
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,166
- Let's take a vote.
Can we switch Jiggly for Alisa?

58
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,300
- Yeah, I agree.

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,367
- Whoo!

60
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,066
[laughter]

61
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,500
- Being in the bottom two
shook me.

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,633
I feel like there's a target

63
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,333
on the back of my head.

64
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,467
And all these bitches are trying

65
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,633
to assassinate me.

66
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,100
So nervous now.

67
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,433
'Cause now I have to really
prove myself.

68
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:43,734
- Well, can I give you
a piece of advice?

69
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,500
Just really try to stay
more focused

70
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,066
on the competition.

71
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,333
Like, don't--
- I know.

72
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,266
- It was, like--I thought
that I was focused.

73
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,166
I feel like I have to claw

74
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,767
and dig my way
back to the top.

75
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,066
- So you're feeling good
about your win?

76
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,066
- Oh, I'm feeling fantastic
about my win.

77
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,066
- You fucking rocked it.

78
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,133
It was kind of made for you.

79
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,133
- I know.

80
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,367
I'm such a natural loser

81
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,066
that it was very odd for me
to win a challenge.

82
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm the freak queen,
and back home,

83
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
I'm kind of like
the laughingstock

84
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,433
of the drag community.

85
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,400
And I'm not
used to winning anything.

86
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,300
So it's exciting,
but at the same time,

87
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,066
it's really humbling.

88
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,834
- They're calling you the silent
killer, bitch, because

89
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,400
everybody thought you were gonna
win the challenge.

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,066
- I mean, I did think I was
gonna win,

91
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,200
but I understand
why I didn't win.

92
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,133
- Well, after she had said--
- I'm too quiet.

93
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,600
- Yeah, you're too quiet, bitch.

94
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,233
- I was quiet because I was
trying to focus.

95
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,300
My strategy isn't gonna change,
because I know that I prepared

96
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,166
a package to beat these girls.

97
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,500
So, I mean, I'm fine.

98
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,734
- Speak up, Lashauwn.
- Can everybody hear me?

99
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,467
- Fly away.

100
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,467
[siren wails]

101
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,467
[all oohing]

102
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,400
- Girl, you got she-mail.

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,467
[cheers]

104
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,533
Hello, dolls.

105
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,633
all: Hi.

106
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,066
- I've come to pump you up.

107
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,166
And I don't mean your lips.

108
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,633
So get ready to beat your mug,

109
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,066
pummel the runway, and fight for

110
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,233
the spotlight.

111
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,300
It's time for some necessary
roughness.

112
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,066
But, remember, just anything

113
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,567
but the face.

114
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,667
I'll get the money, mister.

115
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,233
Just don't hurt my face, please.

116
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,667
[applause]

117
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,900
Hello, hello, hello.

118
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,934
- RuPaul!

119
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:18,967
- Hi.

120
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,600
[cheers and applause]

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,333
Now, ladies, as you know,

122
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,066
padding is the foundation
of drag.

123
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,934
A queen's girlish figure
depends on it.

124
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,834
For today's mini challenge, I

125
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,533
want you to make an ass
of yourself.

126
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,967
Literally. Oh, pit crew.

127
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:42,066
- Whoo!

128
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,433
- You have 30 minutes to put

129
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:47,400
all this junk in your trunk.

130
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,367
I'm dividing you
into three groups.

131
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,800
And the one queen from each

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,367
group with the juiciest ass

133
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,200
will win.

134
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,066
Ready, set, style.

135
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:03,266
[exclamations and shouting]

136
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:05,400
- Don't kick over my packing
peanuts.

137
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,066
- I make fierce pads, but this

138
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,200
ain't how I usually make my
pads, y'all.

139
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,667
- 30 minutes is not enough.

140
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,834
You need at least a good hour
to even start making pads.

141
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,400
- When making your ass, always

142
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,266
draw the shape of Africa.

143
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,400
- That's it.

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,667
- Or, as Latrice would say,
the homeland.

145
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,867
- [giggles]

146
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm Polynesian, bitch.
Get it straight, honey.

147
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
- I thought we were doing an
athletic challenge,

148
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,667
so I'm in a jock.

149
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,700
Sorry about it.

150
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,667
- Okay, lady-kins, time's up.

151
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,100
All right.

152
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,800
Apple bottoms.

153
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Now Jiggly is serving cellulite
realness.

154
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
[laughter]

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,700
- Yeah, that's how realness is.

156
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,100
- Now walk that ass.

157
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,400
Bottoms up.

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,166
Shake it, don't break it.

159
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,834
Phi Phi O'Hara, now that's what

160
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,800
I call a power bottom.

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,834
Seems like your pants are coming
down, Madame.

162
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,066
- [screams]

163
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,133
[laughter]

164
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,433
- Madame.

165
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,967
- Next up, the ghetto booties.

166
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,700
Make it pop. Now walk.

167
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,400
- Hips don't lie.

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,633
But that ass do.

169
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,133
Girl, can I get some fries
with that shake?

170
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,133
[laughter]

171
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,133
Damn.

172
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,600
- I had a proper ghetto booty,

173
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,133
and I was the only one wearing
lipstick.

174
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,333
- Next up, the badonkadonks.

175
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,834
- A badonkadonk booty, it's

176
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:28,967
like a whole bunch of

177
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:32,333
donkadonkadonkadonkadadadada...

178
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,967
- Now walk.

179
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,233
Ass everywhere, ass everywhere.

180
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,467
Ass everywhere.

181
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,500
Ooh, two scoops.

182
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,233
Ladies, all y'all
is sassy assassins.

183
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,900
But three of you really
killed it.

184
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,200
The winners of this mini

185
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,934
challenge are...

186
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,667
Miss Phi Phi O'Hara...

187
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,633
[cheers]

188
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,867
Miss Willam...

189
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:00,367
[applause]

190
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,567
Miss Chad Michaels.

191
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,767
- Hey.

192
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,667
- Con-drag-ulations.

193
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,200
If I were you, I'd hold on tight

194
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,734
to my padded ass, because, for

195
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,667
this week's main challenge,

196
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,867
you'll be transforming

197
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,200
yourselves into wrestling's

198
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,066
trashiest fighters--the luscious

199
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,967
ladies of the WTF.

200
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:24,967
- Yes!

201
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,266
- Whoo-hoo.

202
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,500
- I am a big bitch.

203
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,734
Who is gonna outwrestle me?

204
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,767
Nobody.

205
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,066
- Oh, my god.

206
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,567
I am not athletic at all.

207
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,767
- This week, you'll need to

208
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,500
flex your charisma, uniqueness,

209
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,600
nerve, and talent to become

210
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,734
over-the-top wrestling
characters.

211
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:49,400
You will compete in teams.

212
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,934
Phi Phi O'Hara, Willam,

213
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,834
Chad Michaels, since you won the

214
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:58,066
mini challenge,
you are team captains.

215
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,900
You get to pick your queens,

216
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,867
starting with Phi Phi.

217
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,800
- I'd have to go with Latrice.

218
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,233
- Yes.

219
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,800
- Dida.

220
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,100
- I will take Milan.
- Yeah.

221
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,967
- Come on down, baby.
- Kenya.

222
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,633
- [growls]

223
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,333
- Princess.

224
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,433
- Miss Needles.

225
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,567
- I am a knockout.

226
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:20,600
[laughter]

227
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,233
Uh, ow.

228
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,567
- I didn't want Jiggly or

229
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,867
Madame LaQueer because they're

230
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,333
always complaining that their

231
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,066
feet hurt or they don't want to
do active stuff.

232
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:29,967
Lashauwn.

233
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,200
- [growls]
- There we go.

234
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,433
- All right, Willam, it's
between Jiggly and

235
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,333
Madame LaQueer.

236
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,100
- I'm just praying, "Please pick
me, pick me, pick me,

237
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,333
pick me, pick me."

238
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,667
- Jiggly.
- [grunts]

239
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,734
- Yes!
- Wah!

240
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,433
[laughter and applause]

241
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,834
- All right, so that means
that Chad gets Madame LaQueer.

242
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,233
- It feels kind of weird

243
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,200
being, like, the last picked.

244
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,467
You know, the weird boy, but

245
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm used to it, though.

246
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,667
- Each team needs to decide

247
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,867
which two will play the

248
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,333
heroines, or the faces, and

249
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,066
which two will play the

250
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,834
villains, or the heels.

251
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,600
In a moment, you'll meet three

252
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
pros who will coach you in the

253
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,266
art of wrestling.

254
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:18,533
Gentlemen, start your engines.

255
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,600
And may the best woman win!

256
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,767
- Let's do a script.

257
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,433
- Mama, you got a dream team
here.

258
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,867
- I know.
That's why I picked it.

259
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,667
- There's something very
important.

260
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,533
I had a previous injury
in my right ankle.

261
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,066
I hurt my right ankle
doing a show.

262
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,400
I didn't saw the step, and my

263
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,367
ankle goes click, and suddenly

264
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:42,667
I couldn't walk.

265
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,133
- Are you gonna be okay, I

266
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,467
mean, like, with your ankle?

267
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:46,767
- Don't worry about my ankle.

268
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,133
- I am gonna worry about it,
because it's important.

269
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,367
If your ankle's hurting and you

270
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,633
can't do something, you need to

271
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,734
let me know, because I can't
read your mind.

272
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,066
- I'm so happy with this team.
- I know. I'm excited.

273
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,967
- This challenge includes a lot
of steps.

274
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,900
We have to come up with a back
story, looks, costumes,

275
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,800
moves, everything.

276
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,166
I'm really good with falls and

277
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,734
being, like, stunted.

278
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,433
I do stairs. I can do anything.

279
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,867
I'm really excited because I

280
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,300
usually play people who get beat

281
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,567
up, and I got my ass kicked on

282
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,033
every major network.

283
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,767
- And we just make sure that

284
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,166
we--attitude, attitude,
attitude.

285
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,200
- Wrestling isn't my thing.

286
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,900
I'm not a violent person.

287
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
So I'm a little concerned.

288
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,734
- We are gonna ace this,
you guys.

289
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,300
We gon' kick their ass.

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,433
- So our challenge is to become
wrestlers.

291
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,633
We're the first team to go up
and practice.

292
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,867
I see three humungous dudes just

293
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,467
going at each other.

294
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,166
Oh, my god. This is real.

295
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,233
- [whimpers]

296
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,033
- I'm "Hollywood's Own"
Joey Ryan.

297
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,000
-<i> Yo soy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Hector "El Chido"</i>
Canales.

298
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,667
- I'm Mr. K.O.S.
"King of Submission"

299
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,467
Ryan Taylor.

300
00:10:57,467 --> 00:11:01,100
- Let's now get into a little
bit of the choreography.

301
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,433
Go ahead and throw her
onto Ryan.

302
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,500
- Oh.

303
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,667
- You're gonna catch her and
fall.

304
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,333
- This bitch heavy.

305
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,700
- And then you fall
on your back.

306
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,233
- Oh, my god.
- Fall, bitch.

307
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,734
- As safely as possible.

308
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,600
- Oh, my god.

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
- I'm worried Lashauwn's not
gonna actually get the concept

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,500
of what she has to do here.

311
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,567
Come on, girl. Come on.

312
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,467
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [whimpers]

313
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,800
- [growls]

314
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,934
- Everyone in my group's
personality is so loud...

315
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,400
[yells]

316
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,967
And I'm not really like that.

317
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:37,700
I'm really quiet and soft.

318
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Oh.

319
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,066
[laughter]

320
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,934
- My god, Latrice.

321
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,200
- We're gonna show you
some strikes to the gut.

322
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,166
- [grunts]

323
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,567
- The big reaction is his sell.

324
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,433
And your sell will be here

325
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,400
and to the camera.

326
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
- All right.
I'm an actor.

327
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,633
I've been on TV a lot.

328
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,066
I'm cool. I can do it.

329
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,266
[grunting]

330
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,633
- Pop off, bitch!

331
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,800
- And I did.

332
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I sold it.

333
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,467
I get a People's Choice.

334
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,066
- So the bad guys make their

335
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,066
entrance, they cannot care less

336
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,233
about the audience, right?

337
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,233
Make us hate you.

338
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,233
- Be yourself.

339
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,367
- I got this.

340
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,800
This is cake. Fuck y'all.

341
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,867
I don't give a shit.

342
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,333
New York, motherfuckers.

343
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,767
Brooklyn!

344
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,834
- Jiggly was very aggressive.

345
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,867
- Fuck y'all.
I've got this shit.

346
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,867
- And I was like, girl, take it
down a notch.

347
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,700
- New York, baby.

348
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
- I'm not from New York.

349
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,934
- Oh...

350
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,800
- And you were good too.

351
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,667
Princess is giving
closed-captioning,

352
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,066
while she's in stereo.

353
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:38,367
- Okay, you guys.
Exaggerate, okay?

354
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,734
Like, "Aah!"

355
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,300
Loud. Noise.

356
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,500
- Ahh!

357
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,200
- Larger than that.
- What the hell was that?

358
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,500
- I'm worried about Princess
because she's quiet.

359
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm going "Rah! NY, baby!
This is--"

360
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,667
And she's like...

361
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,567
[mumbling indistinctly ]

362
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,900
And I'm like, "Huh?"

363
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,600
- We're gonna demonstrate some
holds for you.

364
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,767
Some wrestling moves for you.

365
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:04,433
We were thinking of a body slam.

366
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,700
- [laughs]

367
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,567
- Do any of you guys
have a problem with that?

368
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,934
- I'm a little worried
about the physical

369
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,066
extremities of this challenge.

370
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,934
- Let's have you try that
to her.

371
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,200
- Okay. All right.

372
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Come on, Mrs. Ed,
with that horse face of yours.

373
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,433
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop a second. Stop.

374
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,166
Stop a second. Stop a second.
Stop a second. Stop a second.

375
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,133
You don't want to pick--

376
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,600
- Like a baby.
- Yeah.

377
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,066
- Oh, come on, Grandma.

378
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:29,066
Oh, my God!
Let me go.

379
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,433
[both grunting]

380
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,400
RuPaul once famously said

381
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,867
that drag
is not a contact sport.

382
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,100
Apparently, she's gone back
on her word.

383
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,500
[coughing]

384
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,066
- From there, we're gonna have
you give her

385
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,367
the airplane spin,

386
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:44,967
which they're gonna demonstrate
right now.

387
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,633
- It's a very fun--
- Okay.

388
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:53,533
- I'm concerned that something
could happen with my ankle and

389
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,533
making our team lose.

390
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,667
I have a lot
to be nervous about.

391
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,066
- All right, come on, Madame.

392
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,233
My damn face is sick
of looking at you.

393
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,700
- [grunting]

394
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
- Oh. Oh!

395
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,166
- Get her up.

396
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,934
- Put me down.
- Take your time. Slow.

397
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,533
- Jeez Louise.

398
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,867
- Ugh.

399
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:15,900
- Sorry.

400
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,066
- Ouch.
- You okay?

401
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,967
- I'm nervous about Madame
LaQueer.

402
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,200
She's not as physical as the
rest of us.

403
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,834
She really has to push, push,

404
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,166
and push through it.

405
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,367
- Ouch.

406
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,900
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?

407
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,700
Y'all look like a sweat shop.

408
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,767
- I'm sorry, but did you see
Willam's outfit?

409
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,100
- Yeah.

410
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,333
- Phi Phi's gonna like me
eventually.

411
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,667
I know it.

412
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,600
I think her and I should just
unite with mutual enemies.

413
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,967
- [scoffs]

414
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,467
- I mean, it's just easier
to go after ugly people,

415
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,834
but, I mean, the ugly people

416
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,467
are gonna be gone
soon enough anyway.

417
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,200
- Okay, well, then who's
the ugly people?

418
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
- Well, not me.

419
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,233
- Hello.

420
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,066
- Hello, hello, hello.

421
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,467
all: Hi.

422
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:00,300
- Well, team Phi Phi O'Hara...

423
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,433
- Yes.

424
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,900
- Which team is the faces?

425
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,667
- It would be me and Lashauwn.

426
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,934
- So, of course, these two
are the heels.

427
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:09,233
What is your story?

428
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,867
- They gave us the wrong
treatment, and we grew beards

429
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,433
instead, and we're a little
bitter about that.

430
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,266
- Are you actually gonna
be wearing beards?

431
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,266
- Yes.

432
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,633
- You know, that concerns me a

433
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,667
little bit, because the luscious

434
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,834
ladies of the WTF need to be
beautiful.

435
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,233
- I think our story will get

436
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,100
across, and it's not that they--

437
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,400
- But you're not the one who's
gonna be looking hideous,

438
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
are you, darling?

439
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,934
People watch wrestling because

440
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:33,934
they want to be excited, they

441
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,200
want to be turned on.

442
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,567
They want beauty.

443
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,800
Now, Lashauwn, can you give me

444
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,066
a little taste of what your good

445
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,266
guy says?

446
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,967
- "Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass."

447
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,834
- In wrestling, the good guys

448
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,700
are just as loud and obnoxious

449
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,166
as the bad guys.

450
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,300
Is it fair to say that you're

451
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,066
still working on it,
you haven't...

452
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,700
- Yeah, we are
still working on it.

453
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I mean, yeah, we are.

454
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,333
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

455
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,767
All right.
- Bye, Ru.

456
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,133
- Team Willam, what's going on?

457
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,800
Who on your team are the faces?

458
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,166
[laughs]

459
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,133
Now what are your costumes
gonna be like?

460
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,467
Was that something that you made

461
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,667
or you already had?

462
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,066
- We just embellished
on top of it.

463
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,233
- Oh, I see.

464
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,100
- And I'm embellishing on top
of mine as well.

465
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
- Jiggly, you took some heat

466
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,867
last week for your costume.

467
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,066
- Yeah.

468
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,100
- You know, we are looking for

469
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,233
the luscious ladies of the WTF.

470
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,333
- Oh, I'll be luscious.

471
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,467
I'm not trying to be in that

472
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,900
bottom two again.

473
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,834
- Gather around, dolls.

474
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:34,166
Now, tomorrow at the WTF
main event,

475
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,500
we'll be joined by our

476
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,567
extra-special guest judges...

477
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,100
NBA champions Rick Fox

478
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,066
and John Salley.

479
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:46,233
[cheers and applause]

480
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,767
- I think I'll tuck extra-tight

481
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,066
for Rick Fox and John Salley.

482
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,133
- Now, remember, safety first.

483
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,767
But, whatever you do,
don't fuck it up.

484
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,433
all: Bye, Ru.

485
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,867
- Whoo.

486
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,934
[cheers]

487
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,500
- Ladies and gentlemen, are you

488
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,333
ready to experience a female

489
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,633
phenomenon?

490
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,166
[cheers]

491
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,333
Bring on the glamazons!

492
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,400
[cheers and applause]

493
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,633
- Oh, my god, can you believe
those Bitter Betties

494
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,233
came in here to ask us for help?

495
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,367
And I even let them use, like,

496
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,700
my really good hair products.

497
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,133
- That product?
- Yeah.

498
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,967
- That's the hair-growing tonic.

499

- You--look what you did
to her hair.

501
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,900
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?

502
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,200
- Your plastic hair and your

503
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,467
plastic tits
and your plastic ass.

504
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,133
We'll handle you.
We'll get in the ring.

505
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,934
- Bring it. Bring it on.
- Come on, girls. Come on.

506

[rock music]

508
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,867
- Mess with these nasty girls

509
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,667
and you'll end up with a bad

510
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,400
taste in your mouth.

511
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Give it up for Latrice
"The Beast"

512
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
and "Killer" Kenya,

513
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
the Bitter Betties.

514
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,667

and Phi Phi "Fierce."

520
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,500
- The crowd was chanting and

521
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,200
all the signs had our names
everywhere.

522
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,500
It felt so good.

523
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,333
I was ready to beat those
bitches down.

Spanish.

[booing]

552
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,100
- Bitter, bitter pill
to swallow.

553
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,800
The Bitter Betties win.

554
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,633
[booing]

555
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,700
- Those other teams
better watch out

556
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
because, me and my girls,
we kicked ass.

557
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,066
[booing]

558
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,467
- Touch this skin, honey.

559
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,233
They can't take it.

560
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,133
- Mm-mm. They're overgrown...

561
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,700
both: Orangutans.

562
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,467
- Speaking of orangutans.

563
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,533
- What are you doing in our
dressing room?

564
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:28,700
- We know it's your dressing
room, as tacky as it is,

565
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,133
like y'all two bitches.

566
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,500
both: Tacky?

567
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,200
- Oh, no, honey, we don't want
to go there.

568
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,433
We saw you two
in Coach Carter's office.

569
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,900
- Oh, so that's how we got
kicked out of school?

570
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,033
'Cause of y'all bitches?

571
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,533
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.

572
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,533
Get out of here.

573
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,500
[cheers and applause]

574
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,400
- Tuck and cover...

575
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,433
- Shut up!

576
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,700
- Get the fuck out of here.

577
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,767
- For "Pucker Up" Princess

578
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:52,400
and "J-Train" Jiggly,

579
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,233
the Thunder Booties.

580
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,800
Get on the wrong side of these

581
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,233
sexy scissor sisters, and

582
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,400
they'll cut you--

583
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,066

and Dida "Diddles".

585
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,300
They're DWF.

[bell clinks]

589
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,100
- Get 'em, girl.
- You plus-sized jujube.

590
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
- Oh, please.

591

[exclamations]

592
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,300

[exclamations]

594
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,734

00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:23,066
the wall, badass, crazy,

596
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:26,800
wrestler bitch.

597
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
- Whoop her ass.

598
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,967
[cheers]

599
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:33,800
- Get her!

600
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,066
- [yells]

601
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:37,467
- The Princess, she's not going

602
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,133
as crazy as I am.

603
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,367
So if I get in the bottom two

604
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,066
because of this bitch, it ain't

605
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,100
gonna be cute.

606
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,066
[shouting]

607
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,467
What?

608
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,467
- It's not fair.

609
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,533
[indistinct shouting]

610
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,233
That's not fair!

611
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,200
- Sumo smash!

612
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,367
[exclamations]

613
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,934
- And thank you.

614

[bell rings]

615
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:13,500
- The winner is Thunder Booties.

616
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,934
- Team Willam
put on a goddamn show.

617
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:20,633
[cheers and applause]

618
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,800
- Oh, Milan "LaModel", I have

619
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,066
to be honest with you.

620
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,967
I woke up with an itch down
there,

621
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,734
an itch in my pubic hair.

622
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:31,900
- I've got snatch-scratch
fever too.

623
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,367
- But forget about
this bitch of an itch.

624
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,367
Look who it is.

625
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,066
It's the Bitch Kickers.

626
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:39,200
- What's up there, Knockouts?

627
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,734
How's it hanging,
scratch 'n' sniff?

628
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,133
- [speaks nonsense]

629
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,166
- They must have gotten our

630
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,600
special delivery we sent in

631
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,233
when we banged their boyfriends.

632
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,567
- [chatters nonsense]

633
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,600
Boink, boink.
- Oh, my god.

634
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,100
- That's right, LaQueer.
- Those Bitch Kickers.

635
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,934
Oh, those cheap, terrible girls.

636
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,767
[cheers and applause]

637
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,133

638
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,266
whoop-ass.

639
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,500
Give it up for Sharon "Shocker"

640
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,367
and Milan "LaModel"--

641
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,500
the Knockouts.

642
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,600
Don't hate these girls because

643
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,266
they're beautiful.

644
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,433
[booing]

645
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,166
- Shut your pie hole, you slut.

646
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,400
- Hate them because
they're bitches.

647
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,433
- You want some of this?

648
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,333
We got plenty for you too.

649
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,433
- Chadarella "Chainsaw" Michaels

650
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,567
and Madame "LaCrush"--

651
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:35,433
the Bitch Kickers.

652
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,400
[bell clinks]

653
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
- You skinny little
blonde bimbo.

654
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,967
You can run, but you can't hide.

655
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,600
- All right, well, I'm fast

656
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
as a butterfly--

657
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,934
[exclamations]

658
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,467
No!

[booing]

660
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,800
[coughs]

661
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,633
- I am a little bit worried
about Madame LaQueer 's ankle.

662
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,734
I mean, you're the captain
of the ship,

663
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,066
you're going down
with the ship.

664
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,333
- All right, Kirstie Alley

665
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,600
before<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>

666
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,700

667
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,967
[shouts indistinctly]

668
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,633
This is not in my contract!

669
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,367
- If my ankle hurted, I forgot

670
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,800
about everything.

671
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,100
I was Madame "LaCrush"
in that moment.

672
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:19,100
[cheers and applause]

673
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,066
- Joan Jett called.

674
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,467
She wants her wig back.

675
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,066
[exclamations]

676
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,133

[crowd chanting indistinctly]

678
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:37,200
- You're mine now, baby!

679
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,900
I'm gonna hit you
in your visage.

680
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,533
[crowd chanting "USA"]

681
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:47,667
- No one hits my sister!

682
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,533
Why?

683
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,200
Because I'm sickening, bitch!

684
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,066
[cheers]

685
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,967
- Chicago, bitch!

686
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:01,667
[shouting]

687
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,667
[cheers and applause]

688
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:04,734
[bell rings]

689
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,967
- Okay.

690
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:08,100
- The Knockouts have won!

691
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,166
[cheers and applause]

692
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,233
- We might have been slightly
sloppy,

693
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:18,200
but I think our team created
the best characters.

694
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,266
[cheers and applause]

695
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:25,066
- Yay.

696
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,500
- Miss Cheesecake.

697
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,400
It's elimination day, and

698
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,700
everyone's really anxious right

699
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,567
now to find out how they did in

700
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,100
the wrestling challenge.

701
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,200
I think we have a really good

702
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,367
shot at winning.

703
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,500
- I hope.

704
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,533
- I'm just worried.

705
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:38,800
- What are you worried about?

706
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,934
You did great.
You were so funny.

707
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:42,100
Were you unpleased with anything

708
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,934
when you left the ring
yesterday?

709
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,800
- With me, no.

710
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,734
I am kind of iffy
about Princess.

711
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:51,467
It is a competition, and, they

712
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,567
don't like one thing, the whole

713
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:56,066
team goes on--
it's a team challenge.

714
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,066
- That energy you're giving off
is bringing everybody else down.

715
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,433
Girl, I cannot be bothered
right now.

716
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,066
- Are you nervous today?

717
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,934
- You know what, I am a little
bit nervous.

718
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,200
You might feel some sort of kind

719
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,066
of way, and you could be dead
wrong.

720
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,333
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,300
- Thinking you sickening bitch
and talented bitch,

722
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,800
and they be like, "wah-wah-wah."

723
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,967
- I'm a little nervous to see

724
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:18,867
what the judges think about me
in the ring.

725
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,967
I did my best, but you never

726
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,533
know what they're gonna say.

727
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,700
- You sew for all the girls

728
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,133
back at home?

729
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,834
Like, the girls.

730
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,333
The girls the girls.

731
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,333
- Just girls like you.

732
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,266
By me sewing so much, I don't

733
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:33,633
really get a chance
to even be in drag myself.

734
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,800
- Uh-huh.

735
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,934
- So it's like I missed
my drag childhood.

736
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,266
- Ha ha.

737
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,700
- So that's why the competition

738
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,967
is perfect for me, 'cause I'm

739
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,500
just filling in for what I

740
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,800
missed out on.

741
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,433
- That's sickening, 'cause you
definitely

742
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:47,467
about to make up
for some lost time.

743
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,467
- Ooh.

744
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,100
- Hey-hey, that's what you get.

745
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,133
The ultimate drag boot camp
of life.

746
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
- Madame, what does your family
think about you doing drag?

747
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,567
- I'm not close to my family
at all.

748
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,533
My family, for me, are my
friends.

749
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,734
They're the best friends
in the whole world.

750
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,333
Baby, don't. It's okay,<i> mami.</i>

751
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,800
- We're selfish and vain

752
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,967
creatures of beauty, and isn't

753
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,367
it bizarre how we make the best

754
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,333
friends in the world?

755
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:22,567
- [laughs maniacally]

756
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,900
- Hey, guys.

757
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,367
- Hey, baby.

758
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,934
- Welcome to the main stage of

759
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:41,867
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

760
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:45,166
Michelle Visage, my tag team
sister.

761
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,734
- I got a full nelson for you
right here, mama.

762
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:48,800
- [chuckles]

763
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,967
Billy B, welcome home.

764
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,200
- Thanks, Ru.

765
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,734
- Are you wrestling
with something?

766
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,734
- Not since I was trying to get
my wallet back

767
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:56,967
from Michelle in the back.

768
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,333
- [chuckles]

769
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,066
Hey, Rick Fox, what did you
think of my girls?

770
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,133
- I was impressed.

771
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,133
Think there was a lot of fight.

772
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:06,233
- Good. And John Salley.

773
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,767
- Hello, Ru.
- BK in the house.

774
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:09,734
[laughter]

775
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,066
I'm so glad you're here.

776
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,400
This week, our queens were

777
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,934
challenged to hit the mats as

778
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:17,834
the luscious ladies of the WTF.

779
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,066
Tonight, I've asked them all

780
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,433
to come decked out in their best

781
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,967
girly-girl attire.

782
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,767
Gentlemen, start your engines.

783
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:28,667
And may the best woman win!

784
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,834
First up, Kenya Michaels.

785
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,900
Gorgeous.

786
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,767
You know, lil' Kim only wishes.

787
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,300
- It's a pink Monday.

788
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,667
- I love the runway.

789
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,700
I feel amazing
because I love to walk.

790
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,333
- Now that is a living doll.

791
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,567
- Mary-Kate Minaj.

792
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,633
Lashauwn Beyond.

793
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,367
She melts in your mouth,
not in your hand.

794
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,400
- Got a penny? She's got a ball.

795
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,734
- [laughs]

796
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,533
- I'm serving bubble gum
yum-yum,

797
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,734
just having fun being

798
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:03,200
flirty, pretty, going girly
beyond.

799
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,567
- I'd like to stick a quarter
in her slot.

800
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,667
- Where is her slot anyway?

801
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,100
- Sharon Needles.
- Ooh.

802
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,066
The lost Arquette sister.

803
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,300
- Oh, wow, she's doing femme.

804
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,567
She got an injection of beauty.

805
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,233
- Playing girly-ish, bouncy,

806
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,433
and sexy is just something

807
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:22,867
really foreign to me.

808
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,300
Just want to show the judges
that I could bring beauty

809
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,834
to the stage
in this competition.

810
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:28,967
- Mwah.

811
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,166
For your consideration,

812
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,066
Jiggly Caliente.

813
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,100
- Kimora lee Simmons
has put on some weight.

814
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,533
- You're jiggling, girl.

815
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,467
- I'm serving banjee girl

816
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:41,667
meets sweet 16, very new York.

817
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,300
- It's Jiggly 's quinceanara.

818
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,734
London, Paris, Milan.

819
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:49,667
I see London, I see France, I

820
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,367
see Milan 's underpants.

821
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:54,467
- I am feeling like black Barbie

822
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:55,867
meets a valley girl.

823
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,066
But, because John Salley is

824
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,734
there, I'd rather
be the Salley girl.

825
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,900
- Once she gets pumping,
it's hard to make the body stop.

826
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,800
- Madame LaQueer.

827
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,567
Representing Puerto Rico.

828
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:08,667
- [speaks Spanish]

829
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,200
She's working the asymmetrical
hairdo.

830
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,100
- Or a hair show in Mississippi.

831
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,166
- I feel great.

832
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,467
I feel like I'm floating.

833
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,100
I think is the most beautiful
I've looked

834
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,033
throughout all the competitions.

835
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:23,467
- Where there's smoke,
there's a pussy on fire.

836
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,533
[laughter]

837
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,033
- This is why I love this show.

838
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,233
- Dida Ritz.

839
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,700
- I thought
it was P. Diddy's mom.

840
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,467
- [laughs]
- Janice Combs.

841
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,767
- I'm giving fish, I'm giving

842
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,800
face, I'm giving you vogue.

843
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,567
I know my runway is fierce.

844
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,533
- Look at those legs.

845
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,567
My good--and they go
all the way up.

846
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,700
- They do? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

847
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,500
- They're not wooden?

848
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,400
- Chad Michaels.

849
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,700
Lady "chadderley".

850
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,900
Oh, my goodness, the world

851
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,266
according to Paris.

852
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,600
- Paris Hilton,
where are they now?

853
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,767
- I'm serving up girly-girl

854
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,934
realness fish on a stick.

855
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,900
I kind of look just like
a yummy little cupcake.

856
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,367
- Heidi Montag called.
She wants her old body back.

857
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,300
The Princess.

858
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,767
She had a little time
for a quick blowout

859
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,066
before she came out.

860
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,400
- It's a windstorm backstage,
I'm thinking.

861
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,367
- Yes, yes.

862
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,800
- The look I'm going for is

863
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,934
very rock star
meets little girl.

864
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:18,367
I am so pumped
for my look today.

865
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,700
- Rock on.

866
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,934
- It's like there's something
about The Princess.

867
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,767
- [laughs]

868
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,800
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

869
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,300
- Telemundo.

870
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,533
- Telenovela realness.

871
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,600
- I was showing
a little bit of skin

872
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,200
and giving them dragged-out
Miami housewife.

873
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,100
- Ooh, her legs are like peanut
butter--easy to spread.

874
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,533
Latrice Royale.

875
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:46,066
Ooh, crown Royale.

876
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,266
I'll have one on the rocks.

877
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,133
- I am feeling good and

878
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,266
looking gorgeous, darling.

879
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,367
Pretty in pink.

880
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,900
I was very pleased.

881
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,066
- Star Jones called.

882
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,667
She wants her old body back.

883
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,934
- She can't have it.

884
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,900
It's otherwise preoccupied.

885
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,500
- Allegedly.

886
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,066
[laughter]

887
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,467
Next up, Willam.

888
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,300
- Hey.
- Wow.

889
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,667
Look at those shoes.

890
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,734
- My look for today
is rich bitch mistress.

891
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,066
I'm serving girly-girl on a

892
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:16,734
platter to go,
sauce on the side.

893
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,900
- Look how her outfit
accentuates her sugar walk.

894
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,600
-<i> Toddlers and Tiaras,</i>
where are they now?

895
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,367
- I think she's Tanya Tucker.

896
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,200
My girls.

897
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,400
You look smashing.

898
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Yesterday, you changed the face

899
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,100
of professional wrestling
forever.

900
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,667
I smell a spin-off.

901
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,900
But one group in particular

902
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,734
really smacked down
the competition.

903
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:51,433
The winning WTF team is...

904
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,500
Team Chad Michaels.

905
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,133
- Whoo!
- Jesus.

906
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,767
[laughter]

907
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,066
- Thank you, Ru.

908
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:05,166
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

909
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:09,266
But two divas stole the show.

910
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:14,633
Madame LaQueer, Chad Michaels.

911
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,600
- The Bitch Kickers.
- Good job, ladies.

912
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,166
- You are both the winners of

913
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,533
this week's challenge.

914
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,166
You'll receive a selection of

915
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,734
wigs from Risque Wigs.

916
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,700
- Oh, my god, I feel so great.

917
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,066
I certainly actually proved them

918
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,900
wrong about having
picking me last.

919
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,066
- However, neither of you will

920
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:36,400
receive immunity next week.

921
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,500
Team Chad Michaels, you may

922
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,700
leave the stage.

923
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,900
Ladies, it's time for the

924
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,333
judges' critiques.

925
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,266
First up, Willam.

926
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,800
Hey, mama.
- Hi.

927
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,066
- Did everything turn out
the way you had planned?

928
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,867
- I think our moves kicked ass.

929
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,133
- Oh, I thought the competition
was weak in the ring.

930
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:03,367
The faces she was giving us
just didn't seem believable.

931
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,700
It was fake.

932
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,567
- Wait a minute.
Wrestling is not fake.

933
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,633
- No, that wrestling was fake.

934
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,800
- Thank you, Willam.

935
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,367
Next up, Dida Ritz.

936
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,333
Now why'd you choose this
as your girly look?

937
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,166
- I'm really channeling
Carrie Bradshaw,

938
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,867
so I thought downtown
New York, very chic.

939
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:20,700
- In the ring, you had,
you know,

940
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,800
the girl that sort of walked
around the ring thing perfect,

941
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,767
better than you had
the wrestling down.

942
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,600
- Thank you, Dida.

943
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,133
The Princess.

944
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,500
- I'm a fan from the hair
to the dress.

945
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,567
I think I bought that dress
for my daughter.

946
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,633
- I disagree. I hate your hair.

947
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,500
I think it looks
like a bad hair show.

948
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,433
- As far as the performance

949
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:42,867
goes, we didn't see any of the

950
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,800
rebel that I know you are.

951
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,500
- I'm a very Zen person.

952
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,900
Just know that
that was me really trying.

953
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,767
- Try harder.

954
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:53,066
- All right,
let's go to Jiggly Caliente.

955
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,066
May I call you Jiggly?

956
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,734
- Of course you can, Ru.

957
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:57,266
- How'd you feel on the runway?

958
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,533
- I felt so cute.

959
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:01,600
The lollipop in my mouth,
door knockers in my ears.

960
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
- The lollipop was more
interesting for me

961
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,066
than what you're doing
style-wise.

962
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:07,900
- And tell me about in the ring.

963
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,266
- It was very energetic
and over the top.

964
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:12,767
- Jiggly, what was the hardest
part of this challenge?

965
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,533
- The thing is, Princess is very
Zen, she's very quiet.

966
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,867
We needed to be, like, crazy,
badass bitches.

967
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,400
- It's hard,
when you're in a team,

968
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,734
and you're trying to make up
for both of you.

969
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,266
- Thank you, Jiggly.

970
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,700
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

971
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,867
- Hi.

972
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:31,367
- You were reading older
than you have to.

973
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:35,500
You could be younger
and more modern.

974
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,734
- I'm watching you, Phi Phi.

975
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,133
I love you.

976
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,400
I think you're gorgeous,
and in the ring,

977
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,533
you were freakin' hi-lar-i-ous.

978
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:44,467
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.

979
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,500
Lashauwn Beyond.

980
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
- Hi, Ru.

981
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,633
- How are your balls?

982
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,133
- My balls are great.

983
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,500
- On the runway,
the gumball machine

984
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,667
told me exactly what

985
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,633
those balls were doing
on your chest.

986
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:57,967
- Better than on her chin.

987
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,400
- Ha!

988
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,233
- I couldn't disagree more.

989
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,567
Your hair and your makeup,

990
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,300
you look like
a backup singer for

991
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,600
Luther Vandross in 1988.

992
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,200
- Rick Fox, what'd you think?
The ring?

993
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,400
- It's not memorable enough
for me.

994
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,567
I would have liked
a little more story

995
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:18,600
and color to the character.

996
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.

997
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,200
- Hola.

998
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
- I thought it was Nicki Minaj.

999
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,266
I'm not joking you.

1000
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,400
Except she doesn't have the ass

1001
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,166
of Nicki or the money.

1002
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,266
- What about as a wrestler?

1003
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:30,567
As "Killer" Kenya?

1004
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,133
- It was like it was

1005
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:34,600
Biggie Smalls and lil' Kim
all over again.

1006
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,967
Baby, baby.

1007
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:36,967
- [laughs]

1008
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,633
- You look like a star, you

1009
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,066
look modern, you look

1010
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:42,266
fashionable, and I think you're

1011
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,066
the one to beat.

1012
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:45,166
- Thank you.

1013
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,900
- Latrice Royale.

1014
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
- Hello, Ru.

1015
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,066
- Shag-quille O'Neal Latrice.

1016
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,934
- [laughs]

1017
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,500
- You set the tone for the

1018
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,266
whole afternoon.

1019
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:57,300
- Oh!

1020
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,166
- You had me at splat.

1021
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,567
- [laughs]

1022
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,867
Thank you, Latrice.

1023
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,233
Well, ladies, I think we've

1024
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,500
heard enough.

1025
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,100
While you girls untuck in the

1026
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,400
Interior Illusions Lounge, the

1027
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,667
judges and I will deliberate.

1028
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,667
You may leave the stage.

1029
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,333
All right, just between us

1030
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,633
brothers and brother-lovers...

1031
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,600
- Thank you.

1032
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,467
- Let's start with Willam.

1033
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,667
- I think Willam is extremely

1034
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,600
fierce and extremely talented

1035
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,433
and very freakin' funny.

1036
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:28,567
But I also think there's
a borderline of smarminess.

1037
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:29,834
I think there might
be an attitude in there

1038
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,066
that can get in the way.

1039
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:34,066
- She seemed like a team captain
that didn't lead.

1040
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:35,834
- I think she did a good job
of leading.

1041
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:39,600
I don't feel that The Princess
did a good job of following.

1042
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,066
- All right, let's talk
about The Princess.

1043
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,533
- Her performance
was really flat.

1044
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,800
- I kind of thought
there was a rock star in there.

1045
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,734
- She's not charismatic enough
to be a rock star.

1046
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,734
- Dida Ritz.
- She's pretty.

1047
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,767
It's just the wigs are not
styled, they're not done.

1048
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:56,300
- You know, she was going
for<i> Sex and the City,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

1049
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,767
and it was more like<i> </i>
<i>Sex in the Alley.</i>

1050
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,066
- Oh, okay.

1051
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:00,567
Well, I'm not gonna turn
that down either.

1052
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:01,600
- [laughs]

1053
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,133
- Jiggly Caliente.

1054
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,667
- In the ring, she uses
everything she has.

1055
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,800
I thought that was an outfit

1056
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,066
until I realized that was really
her belly.

1057
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,967
- [laughs]

1058
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,133
Phi Phi O'Hara.

1059
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:13,533
- I don't know what's under
all that makeup,

1060
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,567
but she doesn't
paint herself pretty.

1061
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,867
- I know she's heavy-handed
on the makeup, but hey...

1062
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,934
who isn't?

1063
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,633
- [laughs]

1064
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,066
Lashauwn Beyond.

1065
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,266
Now, it was remarked that

1066
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:27,233
Lashauwn's personality
was kind of shy.

1067
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,467
- She'll get out of that shyness

1068
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,100
when she realizes it doesn't get
her anywhere.

1069
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
- She's a mess.

1070
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,500
And her personality is like a...

1071
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:36,600
Like a brick.

1072
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,934
- All right, Kenya Michaels.

1073
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,767
Little Puerto Rican sweetheart.

1074
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:43,734
- She's half the size
of any of them

1075
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:46,767
with double or triple
everything else.

1076
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,100
There was nothing wrong.

1077
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
- Her performance was flawless
as well.

1078
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,300
I thought she did a great job
as "Killer" Kenya.

1079
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,767
- Latrice Royale.

1080
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,533
- She owned that role
in the ring.

1081
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,400
It was hard for anyone else
to do better than that.

1082
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,500
- I was very happy with her,

1083
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,266
and I do really like her
and her personality.

1084
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,266
So she's gonna be fun to watch.

1085
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:10,100
- All right, silence.

1086
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,333
Bring back my girls.

1087
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:16,333
Welcome back, ladies.

1088
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,200
Based on your presentation

1089
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,934
in the main ring
and on the main stage,

1090
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:24,433
I've made some decisions.

1091
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,967
Latrice Royale, Kenya Michaels,

1092
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:31,533
Phi Phi O'Hara,

1093
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:34,834
you ladies jumped
on this wrestling challenge

1094
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:38,467
and came out on top.

1095
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,200
You are all safe.

1096
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,700
- Thank you.

1097
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:48,734
- You may leave the stage.

1098
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:52,333
Jiggly Caliente,
we want to know,

1099
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:56,900
is there more to you than just
a queen from the 'hood?

1100
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:02,200
You are safe.

1101
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,667
- Thank you. Thank you.

1102
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,467
- You may join the other girls.

1103
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,767
The Princess.

1104
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,500
You were channeling pink,

1105
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,400
but your performance was beige.

1106
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1107
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,000
- I'm shocked.

1108
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,400
My outfit was on it today,

1109
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,467
whether Billy B
liked my hair or not.

1110
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,367
And I worked my ass off
yesterday in the ring.

1111
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:29,967
There's no reason why I should
have been in the bottom two.

1112
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,934
- Willam...

1113
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,700
you're safe.

1114
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,033
- Bye.

1115
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,667
- Lashauwn Beyond,

1116
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:49,100
as a wrestler, you were more
mumble than rumble.

1117
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,133
Dida Ritz, your<i> Sex and the City</i>
couture

1118
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,700
does not deserve a sequel.

1119
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,300
Dida Ritz...

1120
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:04,233
You're safe.

1121
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:05,300
- Thank you.

1122
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,533
- Lashauwn Beyond, I'm sorry,

1123
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:15,133
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.

1124
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,333
- My whole body started pumping.

1125
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,600
I'm nervous because I want
to stay in the competition

1126
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,367
and I know this dictates
if I will or not.

1127
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,500
- Two queens stand before me.

1128
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,800
Ladies, this is your last chance

1129
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,767
to impress me and save

1130
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,934
yourself from elimination.

1131
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:38,233
The time has come to lip-sync

1132
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,633
for your life.

1133
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:44,867
- I'm pretty amazing,

1134
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,066
and I'm ready to show it.

1135
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,667
Bring it on.

1136
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:51,600
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

[cheers and applause]

- Ladies...

1178
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,800
I've made my decision.

1179
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,834
The Princess...

1180
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:15,266
Shantay, you stay.

1181
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,567
You may join the other girls.

1182
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,600
Lashauwn...

1183
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,834
you are a young queen.

1184
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:29,934
May this experience lift you

1185
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:33,900
to new heights above and beyond.

1186
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,467
Now sashay away.

1187
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,467
- Thank you.

1188
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,633
It's bittersweet, but...

1189
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,700
I'm happy for me to be so young

1190
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,867
and I've only been doing it for

1191
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,934
such a short amount of time.

1192
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:50,333
Some of these girls
being 40 and 50

1193
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:52,400
and so...it was sickening.

1194
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,834
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1195
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,533
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1196
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:01,800
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1197
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,734
Can I get amen up in here?

1198
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:05,367
all: Amen!

1199
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,467
- All right, let the music play!

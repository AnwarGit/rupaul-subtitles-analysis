"What did I tell you last week?"

If they gave me specifics,
I would fucking do it.

to pull out them dust-ass gray-ass wig.

Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

'Cause it could be a very hairy situation.

-Donatella Versace.

I'm doing Donatella Versace!

79
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,830
I've been working on this
for eight months.

80
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,332
I should be out there.

81

myself out of the pretty little box.

since the first time I auditioned.

I mean, come on, girl.

84

-[Miss Fame] Do you have a backup?
-Not at all.

86

I literally don't have
any other choice. I'm doing it.

87
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,890
-[Katya] Who are you gonna do?
-I was thinking about...

88
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,159
doing Little Richard.

89
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,530
-But he's a man.
-You can't do that.

90
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,265
-Why?
-'Cause it's a man.

91
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,001
But I'll be in drag.
He been in drag his whole life.

92

-No, ma'am.
-No Richard.

93
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,571

96
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,481
She only has one line.

97
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,917
-She's got a monologue.
-She's got, "cold pop,"

98
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,453
"bronchitis," and,
"ain't nobody got time for that."

99
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,622
It's funny,
and people are gonna know who it is.

100
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,894
I'm really torn. I just don't know
who I'm gonna do at this point.

101
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,367
[Violet] Who are you gonna do?

102
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,735
[Max] Sharon Needles.

103
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,337
Max is doing Sharon from season four.

104
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,675
She has a darker side to her.
I'll do Disney Sharon Needles.

105
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,845
Really? Sharon's shocking and punk-rock,

106
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,881
and that's kind of
out of character for Max.

107
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,787
Hello, hello, hello.

108
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,822
[all] Hello.

109
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,058
-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.

110
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,327
-Who are you gonna be?
-Raven-Symoné.

111
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,063
How are you gonna channel Raven-Symoné?

112
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,033
She's just kinda high-pitched,
and she's always like, "Oh!"

113
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,239
Girl, no comment.

114
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,875
If we met, we could be best friends.

115
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,145
But what does that have to do
with Snatch Game?

116
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,649
We sitting in the audience have to say,
"Ah, that is so Raven!"

117
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,251
You get back to work.

118
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,821
Hey, good looking. What you got cooking?

119
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,057
I had an unexpected turn of events today.

120
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,462
-What happened?
-Two of us had the same character.

121
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,898
-What queen is it?
-It's Violet.

122
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,668
We were both gonna do
Donatella Versace, but...

123
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,440
I've chosen to do Theresa Caputo,
the Long Island Medium.

124
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,276
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,245
Was it a discussion, or she said,
"I am doing Donatella"?

126
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,215
-She didn't have a backup, and--
-Listen, Miss Fame,

127
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:35,221
the competition is narrowing down. 
So you've got to go for the jugular.

128
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,624
You were kind enough
to change your first choice,

129
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:43,262
But being kind is one thing.
Being the winner is completely different.

130
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:48,167
Do what's in your best interest,
not in the best interest of others.

131
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,170
Well, shit, I'll be Versace.

132
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,741
This is a competition. Sometimes,
you have to step over other girls

133
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,678
to get where you wanna go.
So... Sorry, girl.

134
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,182
{\an8}Today's maxi challenge is Snatch Game,

135
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,053
which is a <i>Drag Race</i> version
of the original show, <i>Match Game.</i>

136
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,455
-Hello, Katya.
-Hi.

137
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,823
-Who are you?
-Suze Orman.

138
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,792
-Have you done her before?
-No.

139
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,994
I know that you do a Russian accent,

140
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,029
'cause the Katya character is Russian.

141
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,233
Why didn't you do a Russian character?
'Cause you do it so well.

142
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,370
What is it you're afraid of?

143
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:30,176
I don't know. I think my whole life,
I've been riddled with anxiety,

144
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,545
-fearful of things that aren't a big deal.
-Ah.

145
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,616
{\an8}I'm afraid to show
this character because it's...

146
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,653
{\an8}the thing that I do best,
and I am terrified of failing at it.

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,523
You have an addiction to the anxiety.

148
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,727
I've never thought of that before.

149
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,197
I've been addicted to alcohol,
crystal meth, cocaine.

150
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,300
You're here because you're super talented.

151
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,102
-Don't be afraid.
-Okay.

152
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,370
[Katya] <i>Addicted to anxiety.</i>

153
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,675
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.

154
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,746
-Who are you doing?
-I've been trying to figure it out,

155
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,048
so I came up with Sweet Brown...

156
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,118
-"Ain't nobody got time for that."
-Or Little Richard.

157
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,591
Uh-huh. Is that what you're gonna go with?

158
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,128
I just... I don't really know.
I'm torn, really.

159
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:26,599
Well, I'm gonna leave that to you.
I can't decide for you,

160
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,100
and that's all I'm gonna say.

161
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,605
{\an8}I think it's very risky
going with Little Richard.

162
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,976
The stakes are very high going into
the Snatch Game, so I'm just debating.

163
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,047
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.

164
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,818
I heard a little rumor
that you're doing an Italian superstar.

165
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,255
-I am Versace.
-She's been funny in skits on television.

166
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,924
How will you avoid doing
what someone else has done?

167
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,393
I think I can execute a better look than--

168
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,464
Look is one thing.
There is a different skill to be funny.

169
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,069
-Let me hear your Italian accent.
-A woman should feel confident, sexy.

170
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,672
She should put something on her body
and feel like she owns the world.

171
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,809
All right.

172
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,410
What other ideas did you have?

173
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,513
I was thinking of even doing
Alyssa Edwards maybe.

174
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,682
Can I see your Alyssa Edwards?

175
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,953
Real once, done. Top, bottom, done.

176
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,257
That's good. You might want
to consider switching to Alyssa.

177
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,098
Motherfucker. Stir the pot, RuPaul.
Do you want a spoon?

178
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,368
All you gotta do is make me laugh. Okay?

179
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,802
-Get to work.
-Thank you.

180
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,170
All right.

181
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,972
Can I get a time check?

182
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,344
I cannot believe this shit.

183
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,751
[Pearl] If you're more comfortable
doing Donatella, then do it.

184
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,087
I'm more comfortable doing
Donatella when there was just one.

185
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,091
I guess I'm gonna fucking do
Alyssa Edwards then.

186
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,429
[Pearl] You don't have to do it
just because RuPaul said you should.

187
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,699
Am I gonna do better than her?
Or is it gonna be competition?

188
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,168
It will definitely be a competition.

189
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,810
Ladies, later today, I will meet you
on the set of Snatch Game.

190
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:22,415
So good luck and don't fuck it blank.

191
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,057
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome to Snatch Game.</i>

192
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,494
Let's meet our contestants.
A talented actor

193
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:40,366
who's spent more time in Barbra
Streisand's basement than she has.

194
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,134
Michael Urie!

195
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
-Hi, Michael.
-How are you?

196
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:47,606
Good to see you.
And all's fair in love and war

197
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,077
with the real Miss Tamar Braxton.

198
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,912
Are you ready to meet our stars?

199
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,680
{\an8}Let's go.

200
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:59,385
{\an8}Our first star is drag superstar
from the House of Haunt,

201
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,254
{\an8}Sharon Needles.

202
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,291
{\an8}Have you been to any good séances lately?

203
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,493
{\an8}I just got back from one.

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,861
{\an8}[dramatic music]

205
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,296
{\an8}[chuckles]

206
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,602
{\an8}All right, down to our next star.
This Cosby kid is all grown-up.

207
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,538
{\an8}Welcome Raven-Symoné.

208
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,173
{\an8}-I just had a vision.
-Really?

209
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,343
{\an8}-I'm a lesbian now.
-[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness!

210
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,446
{\an8}-That's so Raven.
-That is so me.

211
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,817
{\an8}Next up, financial adviser Suze Orman.

212
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,354
{\an8}Hello, my darling dear
little chickadee RuPaul.

213
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,558
{\an8}Now, Suze,
I make $8 an hour hosting this show.

214
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,928
{\an8}-Can I afford a yacht?
-How about a little rubber ducky?

215
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,631
{\an8}I'll throw in
a hot bag of nickels just in case.

216
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,299
{\an8}You've got a deal!

217
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,471
{\an8}Now, from the hit web series
<i>Alyssa's Secret,</i>

218
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,541
{\an8}-Alyssa Edwards!
-[pops tongue]

219
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,879
{\an8}I'm Alyssa Edwards, and this...
is Snatch Game.

220
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,517
I've always wanted to ask you,
what is your secret?

221
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,685
{\an8}-I'm sitting on it.
-[RuPaul] Oh, okay.

222
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,220
{\an8}[cackles]

223
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,291
{\an8}-[Violet] Almost got me there, bitch.
-Oh, good to know.

224
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,629
{\an8}From the Genovese crime family,
it's Big Ang!

225
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,499
{\an8}Hi, RuPaul. I'm feeling very excited.

226
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,036
{\an8}-What is your bra size?
-It's a medical mystery.

227
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,875
From the House of Versace,
it's Donatella Versace.

228
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,212
{\an8}Donatella Versace how's them boots?
How are you?

229
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,416
I'm doing great. Is it pronounced
"Ver-sayz" or "Ver-sa-chi"?

230
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,085
{\an8}It depends on where you come from.

231
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,457
I would have had an Italian accent
instead of a Russian accent.

232
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,559
{\an8}I don't mind.

233
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,594
But... hey.

234
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:54,934
{\an8}Good golly, Miss Molly!
It's rock and roll legend Little Richard.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,370
{\an8}Are you feeling a little more tutti
or a little more frutti?

236
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,739
{\an8}A little more tutti, baby!

237
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,143
{\an8}[holds a note]

238
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,879
{\an8}Shut up.

239
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:11,650
{\an8}Last but not least,
music superstar Adele is here.

240
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,020
{\an8}-Hey, girl!
-Could I buy vowels?

241
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,090
{\an8}-What is that, darling?
-No whammies!

242
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,793
{\an8}No, this is the wrong show.

243
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,395
{\an8}Okay.

244
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,868
{\an8}Are you ready to play the Snatch Game?

245
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,537
{\an8}[Kennedy] <i>It's time for Snatch Game!</i>

246
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,439
Whooo!

247
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,074
Shut up.

248
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,411
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome back to</i> <i>Snatch Game.</i>

249
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,949
{\an8}Here's how the game works.
I ask a question, you give an answer

250
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,219
{\an8}that you think will match
our celebrity contestants'.

251
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,591
First question is
for the beautiful Tamar Braxton.

252
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:58,397
{\an8}Quentin Tarantino is remaking
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> as an action movie.

253
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:03,102
{\an8}In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.

254
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:08,307
{\an8}-All right, Tamar.
-She kills him, okay? Good-bye.

255
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,645
{\an8}Now let's go to our stars and hear
what they have to say. Big Ang?

256
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,916
{\an8}You know what, in my family,
we like to do it the old-fashioned way.

257
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,884
{\an8}You gut 'em like a fish.

258
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,487
-That's a match!
-Yes. Ding, ding, ding!

259
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,556
{\an8}-Big Ang!
-Yeah! Yeah!

260
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,927
{\an8}Financial adviser Suze Orman.

261
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,463
In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.

262
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,132
{\an8}Of course she bangs him,

263
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,236
{\an8}which is what I'd like to do
to most of these women here on stage.

264
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,773
{\an8}Except for this one down here,
Miss Donatella.

265
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,642
{\an8}She looks like a skeleton
made out of beef jerky.

266
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,311
{\an8}[laughter]

267
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,579
{\an8}I love you, Justin Bieber.

268
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,152
{\an8}Let's move on down
to rock and roll royalty.

269
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,122
{\an8}Little Richard!
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.

270
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,525
{\an8}She tightens the screws.

271
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:04,196
{\an8}'Cause we all love a tight screw. A-whoo!

272
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:09,301
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Sorry, that is not a match.
-Shut up.

273
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,404
{\an8}[Kennedy] Whoo!

274
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,108
{\an8}Raven-Symoné. That's so Raven!

275
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,278
{\an8}-I just saw it.
-What is it?

276
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:24,383
{\an8}-She blows him.
-Unfortunately, that is not a match.

277
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,985
{\an8}I'll try again.

278
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,555
{\an8}-No, I saw the same thing.
-Same thing?

279
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,691
{\an8}Let's move on down here to Adele.

280
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,828
{\an8}-Where in England are you from?
-My house.

281
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,966
{\an8}-All right. Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
-Well, if it was me,

282
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,537
{\an8}I would say she rips out his heart
and then sings a whole album about it

283
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,740
{\an8}and gets really popular, but...

284
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,108
{\an8}-it's not me.
-No, no.

285
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,211
{\an8}So I said she polishes his chrome.

286
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,947
It's a good answer, but not a match.

287
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,617
{\an8}Well, could I get a match, please?
It's a fake cigarette.

288
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,254
All right, Donatella Versace.

289
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,491
{\an8}This is not
a doctor prescription refill card?

290
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,427
{\an8}I must be confused.

291
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,797
{\an8}But I did say,
"Hose down Versace boots," eh?

292
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,966
{\an8}[RuPaul] Interesting answer.

293
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,369
{\an8}Honey, that wig was a bad investment.

294
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,671
That's read.

295
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,775
All right, this one's for Michael.

296
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:27,946
{\an8}Rumor has it that they're making
a gay version of <i>Batman &amp; Robin.</i>

297
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:34,153
In this movie, the dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a "blank".

298
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,389
-A bed &amp; breakfast.
-I would stay there.

299
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,192
-I would too.
-Let's go to Sharon Needles.

300
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,629
{\an8}I said haunted house!

301
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,398
{\an8}[RuPaul] I'm sorry, but not a match.

302
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,635
{\an8}Moving on down to Raven-Symoné.

303
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:54,173
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...

304
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,477
{\an8}Weave shop!

305
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,448
{\an8}Oh, Jaidynn, I just got a vision.

306
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,084
You might be lip-syncing
for your life tomorrow, baby.

307
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,655
{\an8}I'm sorry, raven.
Moving on down to Suze Orman.

308
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:14,393
{\an8}I was looking over here at Big Ang,
and I thought of a foreclosed mobile home.

309
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,695
{\an8}You know what, that's fucked up.

310
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,433
{\an8}[RuPaul] All right, Alyssa Edwards.

311
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,337
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...

312
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,575
{\an8}A dance studio, baby.
Hashtag, beyond belief.

313
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,912
{\an8}Not a match, but a nice plug
for your dance studio.

314
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,915
{\an8}-All right, Big Ang.
-Well, I don't know

315
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:44,022
{\an8}about Batman and Robin,
but I love money, yacht, and mansions.

316
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,558
-Mansion.
-It's underneath a mansion.

317
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,827
{\an8}-[RuPaul] It is.
-I had a rough childhood.

318
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,530
{\an8}I wasn't watching

320
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,371
{\an8}You know, me and Batman and Robin
have a lot in common, baby.

321
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,375
{\an8}I said a bathhouse

322

going on up in there, honey. Whooo!

I'm sorry, Little Richard.
That is not a match.

324
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,253
{\an8}Shut up.

325
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,658
{\an8}Next question is for Tamar Braxton.

326
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:26,231
{\an8}Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.

327
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,301
I'm gonna have to say coins,
honey, makes them laugh.

328
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,503
-Even her coins.
-They so rich they pee pennies.

329
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,172
Pssh, pennies.

330
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,209
Let's go over here to Sharon Needles.

331
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,245
{\an8}I said temper tantrums.

332
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,847
{\an8}-You know why?
-Why?

333
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,850
{\an8}Because Ellen never has temper tantrums.

334
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,084
{\an8}[RuPaul] Wait a minute.

335
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:51,623
{\an8}Her temper tantrums make her laugh
because Ellen does not have them.

336
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,594
{\an8}She does, but everything she says
is so damn funny. You can't even tell.

337
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,101
{\an8}Not a match for Tamar. All right, Adele.

338
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,338
{\an8}Adele, how much food
do you have down there, girl?

339
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,674
{\an8}-Smorgasbord.
-I have low sugar.

340
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,742
-[RuPaul] Low sugar.
-[Ginger] I do.

341
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,611
{\an8}She's using my EBT card.

342

{\an8}-[RuPaul] Oh, Lord!
-[Kennedy] Whooo!

343
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,016
{\an8}-Oooh!
-Wrong note, sugar.

344
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:23,589
Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.

345
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,592
{\an8}Sad, sad tears of a clown.

346
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,027

-Yeah.

347
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,297
{\an8}I'm so sorry, Adele. That is not a match.

348
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,833
{\an8}-But it's a song.
-[RuPaul] It is a song, but--

349
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,669
{\an8}-Did I sing it?
-[RuPaul] No, you didn't.

350
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,671
{\an8}So it's not a good song.

351
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,442
{\an8}Probably still won an award for it anyway.

352
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,510
[RuPaul] Probably, yes.

353
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:51,650
Oh, my stars! Time is up.
Which means our winner is...

{\an8}Sir, what do you want me to do today?

361
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:22,547
{\an8}It's time for another elimination,
and people are really feeling the pressure

362
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,783

-I'd love to.

I am kind of freaking out.

370
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,350
I've been completely sober
for the past year and a half.

371
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,923
Most of the time, I'm fine. But being away
from my support network has been brutal.<i> </i>

372
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,594
I know that Fame is sober, so she's
the only other person who can understand

373
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,630
exactly what I'm going through.

374
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,534
-How long have you been sober for?
-For nine years,

375
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,072
but counting days in here
feels like being a newcomer.

376
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,108
That's exactly what it feels like!
Like, it's hard.

377
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,244
-I've never seen that of you.
-I'm pretty good at hiding it.

378
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,083
-I am terrified of failure.
-Yeah.

379
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,152
And my sense of humor is just, like...

380
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,756
-It's been a smoke screen for that.
-Yeah.

381
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,293
And I have to tell you,
the first day I came in here,

382
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,765
the first thing I thought of was,
"You don't belong here.

383
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,433
You're not good enough."

384
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,875
I didn't realize how badly...

385
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,379
I've actually never been able
to love myself, and it's like...

386
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,653
You are, love. You are loved.

387
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm having to deal
with the insecurities I don't wanna face, 

388
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,729
and I did not expect that.

389
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,767
You're being so hard on yourself.
You're in it, but you're not alone.

390
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,404
I'm here with you,
having the same fears and feelings.

391
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:30,308
My character defects are on fire,
and people are seeing me,

392
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,379
and they're like, "Girl talks a lot."
That's my obsessive mind running!

393
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,017
{\an8}There's a lot that I'm relating
with Katya on an emotional level.

394
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,722
To connect and let go of those fears
makes me feel stronger.

395
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,892
This moment is what I needed.

00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,219
Pearl.

475
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,190
You are both...

476
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,060
...safe.

477
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,663
You may leave the stage.

478
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:59,671
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
Starting with Ginger Minj.

479
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,074
I thought you were truly brilliant
as Adele.

480
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,945
You never left character,
and it was a complete transformation.

481
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,248
Today, you owned being thickums.

482
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,551
It was like, "This is me, eat it."

483
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:19,424
The only thing that I would change
is your hair is a little too triangular.

484
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,026
I was trying to do
like an Elvis "Prissley"

485
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,062
-kind of thing.
-I would've gone all the way.

486
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,598
-I usually do.
-I heard that about you.

487
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,234
I'm the one that wrote it
on the bathroom wall.

488
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,570
-[RuPaul] Next up, Miss Fame.
-You look stunning.

489
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:36,341
It's not '40s, it's something different.
And that's really refreshing.

490
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:40,812
Snatch Game. You had so many
missed opportunities, and I wanted more.

491
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,782
It felt like you were 20% there.

492
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,818
You'll never have this opportunity again.
Be here in the present,

493
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,587
and don't let this moment pass you by.

494
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,825
All right. Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy.

495
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,796
I am not a fan of anybody
doing boy drag. You know this.

496
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,597
You killed it.

497
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:05,436
I was like, "Who let
meetratchetpeople.com in here? What?"

498
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,339
But you gave me all the light
that I needed yesterday.

499
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:13,144
I didn't expect this risk from you.
You're my pageant queen.

500
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,781
I'm not always head to toe.
I like to get messy too.

501
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,251
-Oh, okay.
-And this gown, I would climb you.

502
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,187
-Oh!
-[RuPaul laughs]

503
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,356
-Can we go to break?
-Shut up.

504
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:32,330
-[RuPaul] Next up, Max.
-Thank you for the new hair color.

505
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,434
You know what I miss?
Is the gray hair. You look fantastic,

506
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,503
but I think you look normal.

507
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,172
[Michelle] Snatch Game.
You had the look down 100%.

508
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,241
What was missing was everything else.

509
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,081
Sharon's got a twisted sense of humor,
and that was missing,

510
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,984
-and I hate to say--
-It looks like Max is coming apart.

511
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,254
Yeah, I just really needed
to loosen the corset.

512
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,655
-Okay.
-I apologize.

513
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,958
Can we get some help for Max?

514
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,527
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>Oh, bitch, here we go.</i>

515
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,396
{\an8}Cue the dramatics.
You can tell she's an actress.

516
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:10,101
-Max, are you okay?
-♪ <i>So I can't quite recall</i> ♪

517
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,605
♪ <i>All the night's sensation</i> ♪

518
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,774
I took advantage of the moment.

519
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,543
[Miss Fame] <i>Is this a strategy?</i>

520
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,147
{\an8}Because this is one of the first times
that she's not been a shining star.

521
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,083
-Yes.
-[exhales]

522
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,721
-Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Tamar] Today...

523
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,425
I'm still trying to put it all together,
the look. Somehow, it just...

524
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,226
falls flat.

525
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,030
As far as being Raven-Symoné,
it became real like,

526
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,532
"Okay, she's gonna see a vision."

527
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,402
Once, it was funny.
The second time, it was cute.

528
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,037
The rest of the time, it died.

529
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,073
[RuPaul] Next up, Katya.

530
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,743
To go from Suze Orman
to Xena the Warrior Princess,

531
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,780
you look so beautiful and...

532
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,617
I'm losing my train of thought.

533
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:04,055
You really strutted your stuff,
and you were like Britney at 45.

534
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:12,764
And yesterday was just "hilarical", okay?
I really laughed the whole...

535
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,165
I just wanted even more.

536
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,770
I know I'm always asking for more,
but y'all can take it further, so push it.

537
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,943
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,

538
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,512
the judges and I will braid
each other's hair.

539
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,680
Oh, fun!

540
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,815
You may leave the stage.

541
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,787
Just between us squirrel friends,
let's talk about Ginger Minj.

542
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:40,391
She chose a character
that was creative and also challenging.

543
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,895
She came out in all white,
and everybody was in all black.

544
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,097
<i>Only superstars know</i>
<i>to do things like that.</i>

545
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,665
-There's no cons.
-No cons.

546
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,534
I bet there's been a con in her

547
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,503
-once or twice, you know.
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>

548
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,240
She looked the part of Donatella,
but she didn't deliver comedy.

549
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,244
She's not breaking through.
She doesn't feel solid in herself.

550
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,848
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-[Michael] The way that she walked,

551
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,751
<i>look at the spot she would stand in,</i>
<i>even point at the spot,</i>

552
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,687
and then circle it and leave it
and not even stop.

553
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,591
And then Snatch Game,
it was such an over-the-top caricature.

554
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,562
It just worked.
The giant Bea Arthur shoulder pads.

555
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,465
-The lip gloss.
-[Tamar] <i>She changed Little Richard.</i>

556
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,200
She killed it for me.

557
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:26,804
-[RuPaul] <i>Next up is Max.</i>
-When she came in looking so great,

558
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,508
and then there was no characterization,
that was a real bummer for me.

559
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,544
Max likes to stay in a comfort zone.

560
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:37,315
I think that Max has more potential.
She just needs to find it.

561
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:42,253
-[RuPaul] <i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce.</i>
-The Snatch Game was one note.

562
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,922
-I was over it... dot com.
-Okay.

563
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,326
If I'm on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,

564
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:52,163
don't come as Chaka's little sister.
You come as Chaka.

565
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,599
-That's all she has to say about that.
-Okay.

566
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,102
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-Her Suze Orman was spot-on.

567
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,806
I understand that it didn't go full-tilt,
but I loved it.

568
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:07,045
Like, she gave me futuristic
Britney Spears tee-hee-hee, honey,

569
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,148
and Whitesnake tee-hee,
and, you know, Guns N' Roses.

570
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,818
Silence.

571
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,156
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girlses.

572
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,959
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

573
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,862
Katya.

574
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,798
You're safe.

575
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,436
Kennedy Davenport. Great gosh almighty.

576
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,938
You rocked the Snatch Game.

577
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,142
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

578
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,610
[applause]

579
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,045
Thank you.

580
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:45,616
{\an8}I won another challenge. Yay!

581
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:52,423
Ginger Minj, your Adele
had us rolling in the aisles.

582
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:57,762
Condragulations, you are also
the winner of this week's challenge.

583
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,531
That's right, ladies. First tie

584
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,700
in Snatch Game herstory.

585
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,772
{\an8}I won! If there was ever
a challenge to win, it is this one.

586
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,178
[RuPaul] <i>You've both won fabulous</i>
<i>feather accoutrements from Mother Plucker.</i>

587
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,347
You may join the other girls.

588
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,150
Ebony and ivory.

589
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:27,191
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, your vision
of Miss Symoné was not so Raven.

590
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,129
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

591
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,935
Miss Fame, "don't-a-tella" me
that was your best impersonation.

592
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,740
Max, your Sharon Needles missed the point.

593
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,310
Max...

594
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,182
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

595
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,152
{\an8}[Max] <i>Damn, damn, damn!</i>

596
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,922
{\an8}I can't get over the feelings in my head
of disappointment in myself.

597
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,658
{\an8}It's really sort of overwhelming.

598
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,394
Miss Fame, you may join the other girls.

599
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:12,203
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance

600
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,375
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.

601
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,478
The time has come

602
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,147
for you to lip-sync

603
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,784
for your life!

604
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:34,058
{\an8}I can't go home. I refuse.
I gotta protect my spot here.

605
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,927
Good luck

606
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,063

00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,004
Max, you are a true original.

635
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,976
Thank you for taking us all to the max.

636
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,680
Now, sashay away.

637
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:53,764
[Max] <i>I was able to represent myself.</i>
<i>I stayed as classy as I possibly could.</i>

638
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:58,369
I feel like I've been in a dream.
For me to go back to Kansas from Oz,

639
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,372
it's all so surreal.
But there's no place like home.

640
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,546
My seven sisters,
I have a confession to make.

641
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:12,183
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.

642
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:18,422
That I've let one of the eliminated queens
go home... too soon.

643
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,495
{\an8}Ru, girl, what?

644
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,899
{\an8}I'm just not sure which one.
Could it be Tempest DuJour,

645
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:33,204
{\an8}<i>Sasha Belle,</i>
<i>Jasmine Masters, Trixie Mattel,</i>

646
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,009
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis, Kandy Ho, or Max?</i>

647
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,978
{\an8}Ah, shit.

648
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,215
{\an8}No, no, no!

649
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,851
{\an8}Well, I'm sure it'll come to me.

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,834
<i>- Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:05,767
- Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first.

3
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,967
And I don't even think
she's second.

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,133
[exclamations]

5
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:12,300
- Alexis and I, as the twinbots,
we delivered.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,600
both: Dragonauts away.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,166
<i>- All right, Miss Raja.</i>

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,667
<i>- India Ferrah.</i>

9
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,367
<i>Her clone does not sleep alone.</i>
<i>Mimi Imfurst.</i>

10
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,100
<i>- I think that I stand a good</i>
<i>chance of winning this one.</i>

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,600
- Oh, damn the rules.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,533
Let's call it a tie.

13
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:33,300
Shangela, Alexis,
you've won this challenge.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,300
- Ooh!

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,967
- Delta Work, Shante, you stay.

16
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:40,467
Phoenix, sashay away.

17
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,867
<i>And tonight...</i>

18
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,567
It's time to get
totally leotarded.

19
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,767
[exclamations]

20
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,367
<i>The dolls get physical.</i>

21
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,400
- Feel it.
- [laughs]

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,266
<i>And it ain't always pretty.</i>

23
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,800
- Whoo-whoo-whoo.

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,533
<i>- And extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>

25
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:59,900

33
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,667
- Eh.

34
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,200
- Poor Phoenix.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,800
- Delta, you got rid of her.
- Oh, she said boots.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,734
Phoenix is gone, and it's a new
day, it's a new challenge,

37
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,767
and I feel totally reenergized.

38
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,867
Raja, get ready to write
your name on here later.

39
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,700
[laughter]

40
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,333
- We won, girl.

41
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,600
- I'm a little surprised that
Shangela and Alexis won.

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,767
I think that I sort of went
a little outside the box

43
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,233
and was a little more sci-fi.

44
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,800
I felt like I got really close
to winning

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,467
the first challenge too.

46
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,700
- Mimi really does think
that Mimi's first.

47
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,166
- I mean, it's hard.

48
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,567
It's like, you know, you don't
want to be second best.

49
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,834
You want to be best.

50
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,467
- Really, I just didn't wanna
hear her talk.

51
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>[alarm blares]</i>

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,100
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>Girl, you've got she-mail.</i>

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,734
<i>Hello, drag stars.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
all: Hi.

54
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:28,266
<i>- If you wanna win this race,</i>
<i>you've gotta feel the burn.</i>

55
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,633
<i>So stretch, bend over,</i>
<i>and take it</i>

56
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,767
<i>like America's</i>

<i>Let me hear your body talk.</i>
<i>And remember...</i>

58
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:41,066
- Ow!
<i>- No pain, no gain.</i>

59
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,433
<i>[laughing]</i>

60
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,567
- Oh, my god.
- Ooh, girl.

61
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,700
- Oh, my god.
- Let me hear your body talk.

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,567
- Girl, you don't wanna hear
what this one has to say.

63
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,700
[laughter]

64
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,800
- Well, we just lost, girl.
I just lost.

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,433
- Hello, hello, hello!

66
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,867
all: Hey.

67
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,767
- Do you know what time it is?

68
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,300
It's time to get leotarded.

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,734
- Oh.

70
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:06,133
- In this bag is a drag queen's
best friend

71
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,433
and worst kept secret...

72
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,500
duct tape.

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,734
all: Oh.

74
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,500
- Now for today's
mini-challenge, you'll become

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,834
drag MacGyvers to customize
a sporty fashion leotard using

76
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,934
only these rolls of duct tape.

77
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:27,500
But first, you'll need
to split up into groups of two

78
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,467
and one group of three.

79
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,967
- Delta, Stacy.

80
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,900
- Immediately, Mimi decides it
needs to be

81
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
the three
plus-sized queens together.

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,467
- You three here? Okay.

83
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,500
- The last thing I wanna do is
be on a team with Mimi.

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,767
Like, that's the last thing that
I wanna do.

85
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,066
- Ready?
Steady...

86
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,233
Tape!

87
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,834
[shrieking]

88
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,066
- Whatever I 'm doing to you
in pink, you do to me in purple.

89
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,467
Carmen and I have a bunch
of neon colors.

90
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,200
And so our idea is to do, like,
a super '80s,

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,300
kinda '90s workout leotard.

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
Girl, my tuck.

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
- Whoo!

94
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,867
- Sorry, I didn't mean to touch
your dick.

95
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,400
- Don't worry.

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,834
- Alexis and I came up with the
concept of corsets, bustiers,

97
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,333
with a little bit of ruffle.

98
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,934
- Whoo, sister,
you got me together.

99
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,333
Hallelu.

100
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,867
Good thing I didn't need
those ribs.

101
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:21,200
Get up in there.
Ow, ow.

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,166
- This looks like a trash bag,
completely.

103
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,100
I mean, it really looks bad.
This is a disaster.

104
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,900
This looks horrible, and we're
completely mismanaging the time.

105
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,967
- Start over?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,133
- Get over here.
Come here, Stace.

107
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,200
- Sorry.

108
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,166
- We ought to tape these
into your ear.

109
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,834
- Your braid.
- Oh, my god!

110
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:38,600
I love it, I gotta wear it.
- One, two, three, go.

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,400
They're not gonna close.
The boots aren't gonna close.

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,700
- Oh, shit,
something just popped.

113
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,967
- Okay, ladies, time's up.

114
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,300
Wow.

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,934
Ooh-wee, y'all are leotarded.

116
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:55,834
Let's see how
my designing queens did.

117
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,600
Alexis and Mariah...

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Category is duct tape.

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,967
- Alexis and I,
our outfits came out nice.

120
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,533
I feel good about what we did,

121
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,100
and I might even save it
for later.

122
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,133
- Let them have it.

123
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,233
Next up, Yara and Raja.

124
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,166
Letting them have it
in a<i> Flashdance</i><span style="bodyStyle"> effect.</i>

125
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,467
Carmen and Manila...

126
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:19,500
she's wearing
her duct tape iPod.

127
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,834
- We're giving fierce
jazzercise realness.

128
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,166
- Yes, ooh, la-la.

129
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:29,467
Shangela and India,
serving desert storm.

130
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:33,767
Yes, she's looking
for a few good men.

131
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:38,066
Last but not least,
Stacy, Delta, and Mimi...

132
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:38,900
The Supremes are back.

133
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,233
- There were parts
of the leotard

134
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,600
that didn't fit properly.

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,867
Everyone in the room
is looking at me,

136
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,700
and it's a really
uncomfortable feeling.

137
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,600
- Okay...
[laughing]

138
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,867
- That whole group
with Mimi, Delta, and Stacy

139
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,066
looked like two sisters
that had gotten pulled

140
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:58,934
into a girl group that they
didn't wanna be a part of.

141
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,867
- Okay, gym bunnies...

142
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:05,333
Now I've seen your leotarded
outfits, and...

143
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,500
The winning team is
Manila and Carmen.

144
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
- Ah! Wheeee!

145
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,600
- Condragulations, ladies.
Come on up.

146
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Do you know what time it is now?

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,500
It's time
to get totally leotarded!

148
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,567
- Oh!

149
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,100
[applause]

150
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,400
- Now, a great drag queen knows
how important it is

151
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,500
to keep her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
and talent in tip-top shape.

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,400
So for this week's main
challenge, you are going to

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,500
produce your very own
inspirational workout videos.

155
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,433
[applause]

156
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:48,066
Yes.

157
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,300
Now, Manila and Carmen,

158
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
you are the captains
for this team challenge.

159
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,667
Manila, you won the toss.

160
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,066
Who do you pick first?

161
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,734
- Raja.

162
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:01,266
Thank god I won the coin toss.
Gag.

163
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,600
I want Raja because Raja is
the only person I've seen here

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,967
that's actually done a sit-up.

165
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,433
- All right, Carmen,
who do you choose?

166
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,100
- Hmm, I want a big girl.

167
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I want Delta.
- All right.

168
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,667
- My first pick is Delta

169
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,734
because I wanted to form
the prettiest group,

170
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,600
you know what I mean, so I
picked the prettiest big girl.

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,066
- Shangela.
- Mariah.

172
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,166
- Mimi.
- Ah!

173
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,533
- So I choose Yara.
- Alexis.

174
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,600
- Yes.

175
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,367
- I love Stacy,
but I already got my big girl.

176
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,900
So I 'm gonna choose India.

177
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,734
- I get Stacy.
- Yay.

178
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,500
- No shade, girl, no shade.

179
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,800
I've come to realize that if

180
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,467
this was gonna be
a workout challenge,

181
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:43,333
they were gonna leave
the big bitch behind, honey.

182
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,467
- Captain Manila...

183
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,767
Captain Carmen...

184
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,367
you're in charge of assigning
each queen an exercise

185
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,633
and creating a sporty team look.

186
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:57,100
Gentlemen, start your engines.

187
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,567
And may the best woman win.

188
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,800
All right.

189
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,400
- What's the--what's the name
of our video?

190
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,066
- It has to be hysterical.

191
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,066
- Transform yourself.
From flab to fierce.

192
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,433
- Mm.
- I have this idea.

193
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,734
What if I painted myself to look
like I was 85,000 years old,

194
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,967
and I was like, it's,
"Do you like my big ball?"

195
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,433
[giggles]
- What?

196
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,900
- Mimi gets that whole Miminess
of it all,

197
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,233
and it's driving me up the wall.

198
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,834
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

199
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,333
- I'm gonna do the stepper.

200
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,700
- You said you wanted something
with your boobs?

201
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,667
- The boob shaker thingy.

202
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,767
- So she has the shake weight.

203
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:37,834
- Titty shaker girl.
- Is that funny?

204
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,233
- No, you should just call it
the shake n' bake weight,

205
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:41,433
and you just shake and bake,
do it from this side.

206
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,734
- That's right, that's right.
- You can do it from this side.

207
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,533
- There's times when I feel like
I'm not heard,

208
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,934
because a lot of people
in this competition

209
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,433
like to talk over you.

210
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,300
- I can do the jump rope; what
can you do with jump roping?

211
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,734
- Chuck-a-rope.
- [giggles]

212
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,166
- What about chuck-a-rope?
- Okay, yep.

213
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,800
- Our challenge today is to
create a workout video in teams.

214
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,433
- I want us to look like,
kinda like a rainbow.

215
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,934
Like Skittles.
You do blue, and you do green.

216
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,367
Do red. Do red.

217
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,200
I think I'm a good leader.
I think I'm a great leader.

218
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm really good
at judging things.

219
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,400
- Something tastic,
since it's elastic.

220
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,133
- No.
- I listen to people.

221
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,133
- You can put one in here.
- No.

222
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,700
- Like, I could--I could this
one, like...

223
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,734
- No.

224
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,934
- Carmen is so bossy.

225
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,533
- Okay.
But what is that gonna be for?

226
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,934
I don't know if Delta's gonna be
able to do that.

227
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,700
- This is gonna be about
physical fitness,

228
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,834
and I'm completely terrified.

229
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,867
The fact is,
I sit before you 350 pounds.

230
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,266
And I would say not a week goes
by that I don't get a letter

231
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:47,533
from someone commenting on what
a pig I am, or how ugly I am.

232
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:52,300
Jesus Christ, I feel sick.
Thank you for picking me.

233
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,767
- Of course, you're my girl.

234
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:58,066
Delta really needs to work on
her self-confidence issues

235
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,266
because she's flawless.

236
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,000
I think she's sickening,
you know what I mean?

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,467
And...it's a shame.

238
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,333
- So we're doing busted, right?

239
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,700
- Don't look, like,
too crazy busted.

240
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
- And we're doing garage doors?

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,033
- Garage doors, girl.
One color on your eye.

242
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,367
- Where'd you hear garage doors?

243
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,834
- One of my friends from Texas
was, like,

244
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,233
making fun of some queens.

245
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,166
She was like, "that bitch came
out with blue garage doors

246
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,934
on her eyes."
- [chuckles]

247
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,667
I'm sitting here thinking
it's an industry term.

248
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,000
I was like, mm-hmm, yeah,
garage doors, girl.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,567
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi.

250
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,800
- How are my little endorphin
junkies doing?

251
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,934
Team Carmen, right?
all: Yes.

252
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,567
- Now I wanna hear all about
your workout video.

253
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,433
Now India, did you choose
your expertise?

254
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,000
- I was assigned.
I got the rubber tug.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,433
- Oh, have you ever used one
before?

256
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,500
- No. I don't know nothing
about exercising.

257
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
I don't work out, I don't have a
gym membership.

258
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,767
And I 'm like, "oh, god,
this could be good or bad."

259
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:01,200
- What about you, Yara?
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>

260
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,500
- Oh, help me with that.
- It means move forward.

261
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,400
You wanna look like this, you
gotta work it out, darlin'.

262
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,834
So<i> echar pa'lante.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Work it out.

263
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,333
- [giggles]
All right, Delta?

264
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,066
- So I'm going
to shake and bake.

265
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,533
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

266
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,667
- Delta, can you come over and
show me what you've done there?

267
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,367
I'm already inspired.

268
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,400
- Well, we're gonna start with
the weight here.

269
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,633
- Yeah.
- So it's gonna go up and down.

270
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,200
- Ooh, ooh.
- And then you're gonna go...

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,900
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Do you feel it?

272
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,300
- Shake it, don't break it.
Oh, yeah.

273
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,700
I think I just lost five pounds!
- Feel it.

274
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,867
Ha, ha!

275
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,667
- Stacy, you better come up with
something quick.

276
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,066
- Okay, we need to come up with
something else

277
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,467
because I just heard "shake
and bake" over there.

278
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,166
- Well, we'll just change
the name of it.

279
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,867
- What are you thinking, Stacy?
- Spritz stick.

280
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,300
- What?
- A spritz stick.

281
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,834
- What the hell's
a spritz stick?

282
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,734
- I do think that Stacy's
a lovely person.

283
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,667
And you know, we'd probably have
a really fantastic time

284
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,767
listening to bullfrogs and
drinking sweet tea in the

285
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,633
backwoods that she lives in.

286
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,900
But I would lose my mind if we
had to be on the bottom

287
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,667
because of her.

288
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,066
- Well, hello, ladies.
all: Hello.

289
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,400
- Manila,
you're the team captain.

290
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,667
- Yes.

291
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,900
- What is your area of expertise
in this workout video?

292
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,066
- The step and strap.
Works your core muscles.

293
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,133
You bend down and strap your
heels together.

294
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,600
- Have you done it yourself?
Have you tried it yet?

295
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,300
- Girl, no.
- No.

296
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,867
Great, just let the camera roll,
and step and strap.

297
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,633
- Yeah.

298
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:32,433
- Manila was just clueless.

299
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,934
You have to be prepared
in front of Ru.

300
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,400
- Stacy, do you have
an area of expertise

301
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,700
that you're doing in the video?

302
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,834
- My name's actually
the sit and shake.

303
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,066
- The sit and shake?
- Lets you eat your chips.

304
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,433
And while you're doing that,
feeding your face,

305
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,967
you can just shake it off,
like, you know?

306
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,400
- I like it.

307
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,834
Yeah, but what if you don't have
one of these things here?

308
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,700
- A can of soup will be just
fine.

309
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,567
- Okay, I love it.
What about you, Mimi?

310
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,066
What are you doing?
- You gotta love me jump rope.

311
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,400
And it's when you got that man
that you don't wanna lose...

312
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,667
- Yes.
- You can jump rope, grab him,

313
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,567
tie him up, and don't ever
let him leave.

314
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,600
- Now just be careful jumping
rope with heels--safety first.

315
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,066
- Of course.
- Now...

316
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,233
Shangela, what
is your expertise?

317
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,100
- This is the hallelula hoop.

318
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,200
Kate Gosselin, she learned this,

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
and then she loaned me
this hair.

320
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,967
- Oh. Oh, okay.

321
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,333
- You get your hallelula hoop,
and then you say...

322
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,066
and that'll keep your hip.

323
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,600
And the hula hoop hits
the ground.

324
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Ru is probably thinking,
"This ho don't even know

325
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,700
how to hula hoop."

326
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,967
Now listen...
- Okay.

327
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,433
- If it goes down--you see,
I'm single.

328
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,567
- [giggles]

329
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:35,967
- But if it goes down, you talk
dirty to it

330
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,133
and it'll rise back up.

331
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,900
- Oh, I see.
- Cardinal rule.

332
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,533
- Everybody is very funny on my
team.

333
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,533
I'm very concerned about that,
'cause I don't--

334
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,300
I actually don't
do comedy at all.

335
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,500
- All right, Alexis.

336
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,700
- I'm going to be working out
my upper body,

337
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
using the stretch
your upper body.

338
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,266
- Oh, I see.

339
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:54,233
- And I'm using, of course...
lip gloss.

340
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,700
The "lapilaviar" stretch.

341
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,100
- So it's like a cross-training
thing?

342
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,667
- Yes.
- Your lips don't lie.

343
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,633
- Okay.
- Okay.

344
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,800
All right, ladies, now remember,
your workout videos need to be

345
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,900
truly inspirational.

346
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,567
So I'm bringing in someone
to help you...

347
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,934
Stop the insanity!

348
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:16,066
Fitness guru and motivational

349
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,467
speaker Susan Powter
will be here.

350
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,834
- Whoo!

351
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:24,133
- To help you make this workout
video truly inspirational.

352
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,967
- Susan Powter?
I mean, she's legendary.

353
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,934
When I was growing up, I even
wanted to bleach my hair

354
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,367
as white as hers.

355
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,633
That was, like, my reference
when I went to the hair stylist.

356
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:35,734
- I've got a few words of
inspiration for you myself.

357
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:36,967
Don't fuck it up.

358
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,533
- [giggles]
- Bye.

359
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,467
all: Bye, Ru.

360
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,200
- Okay.
- Good job, team.

361
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:49,567
- Well, well, well!
Hello, team Manila.

362
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,633
Meet Susan Powter.
all: Hi, Susan.

363
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:56,633
- Welcome to the fitness world,
ladies.

364
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:03,734
- Our first exercise is called
the step...and strap.

365
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:07,333
- Give me more over-the-top
drag queen sexy.

366
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:11,066
- Step and strap!
- What's your name, honey?

367
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:14,066
- I am Manila Luzon, and you've
just worked out

368
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,133
to the step and strap.

369
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,367
- And that's a cut.

370
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,800
- Hi, everybody, my name is
Alexis Mateo.

371
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,533
And right now, we gonna--just

372
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,533
gonna work out all
our upper muscles.

373
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,734
- I think that was super cute.

374
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:29,100
I think you should go
over-the-top.

375
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,633
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Ocherat--

376
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:33,734
<i>y todos los de mas.</i>

377
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,467
- [laughing]
- Here we go.

378
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,500
The stretchy thingy-majingy.

379
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,066
Open the lip gloss, and we gonna
pull...your lips.

380
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,100
- Give me a little more
attitude.

381
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,300
- Stretch and lips,
stretch and lips.

382
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,066
Are you guys at home getting it?
You need to breathe.

383
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,533
[panting]

384
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,567
My titties were sweating.

385
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,800
[panting]

386
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,567
Yes, you just gotta stretch
thingy-majingy lip gloss

387
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,600
with Alexis Mateo.

388
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,867
- Super cute.
Super cute.

389
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:07,500
- Tough act to follow.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
- [deep voice] Well, hello,
ladies at home.

391
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,266
We're gonna increase some energy
and get rid of that unsightly

392
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,734
bulge in your pants, ladies.

393
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:22,133
Grab the ball and violently bang
your crotch for ten times.

394
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,900
Here we go!
all: Ah!

395
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,967
Two, three, four...

396
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,900
- Raja's character was just
totally crazy.

397
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,467
I just thought
it was really crude.

398
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,934
Not what you're gonna expect
from a drag queen to act like,

399
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,133
basically a dude.

400
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,533
- They call it, in the
infomercial industry,

401
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,667
that soft to camera moment.

402
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,667
- Mm.

403
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,233
- Where you do the "and you
can!"

404
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,734
And then you go,
"and you can also."

405
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,266
- Ah.
- It's that moment.

406
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,967
Give me a little swear
this is gonna work

407
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,467
for you moment, please.

408
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,734
- A lot of times, things don't
go the way that you plan them.

409
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:54,934
- Yes, yes.

410
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:57,667
- Okay, that happens for a lot
of us out there.

411
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,967
But let me tell you something.

412
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,066
You pick up the hallelula hoop,

413
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,567
and you put it back around
your waist.

414
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:07,734
And you work the hallelula hoop.
One, two, three, four,

415
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:11,133
I don't want that boy no more.
Five, six, seven, eight.

416
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:15,367
I am gonna find a date.
- From your hips to god's lips.

417
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,800
- Hallelu.
- Yes.

418
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
- Shangela was adorable.
Shangela is always adorable.

419
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,967
Like a little puppy or kitty
cat, they're always gonna be

420
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:25,600
cute, no matter...if they're
shitting on your carpet.

421
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,433
- Well, how you doin'?
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.

422
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:31,834
Grab your plates, and we're
gonna take our sit and shake,

423
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,467
and we're gonna shake it.

424
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,100
Come on, girls.

425
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,867
- When you shake that, your
beautiful body shakes with it.

426
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,166
So if you're gonna be it, don't

427
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,800
just be it shoving shit in your
mouth.

428
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Be it physically.

429
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,934
- Shake it!

430
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,834
Ooh, ugh.
- Excellent.

431
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,166
- Ooh, yes.
Shake it.

432
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,600
- Stacy Matthews surprised me.

433
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,133
I was so proud of her 'cause she
completely turned it.

434
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,700
And I say "get it, Stacy.
Eat that chicken, you bitch."

435
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,233
- Mm! Mm!

436
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:06,233
- Hello, everybody.
My name is Mimi Imfurst.

437
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,700
Take your jump rope...
chase after your man.

438
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,767
You're gonna grab him... oh!

439
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,934
Hold him up--
- Cut, cut, cut.

440
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,667
Just hold on a second.
Safety first, people.

441
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,200
We don't want anybody
to get hurt.

442
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,967
It's just feeling
a little disorganized.

443
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,266
Okay, everybody get up
and get untied.

444
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:25,266
- All right, here we go, jump.
Jump higher!

445
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,800
You gotta get higher, you gotta
find yourself.

446
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,867
I thought I did great.

447
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,700
I really wanted to create
a character

448
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,367
that really was memorable.

449
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,400
Quick, jump higher!
Faster, faster!

450
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,133
You wouldn't be able to forget
that voice.

451
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,100
'Cause perspiration is
inspiration.

452
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:44,667
- Team Carmen.
- Yes.

453
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,667
- Bitch, we ready to work it
out, and we're gonna pump it up.

454
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,834
Okay.

455
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,166
So...remember, catchphrase is
"work it out."

456
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,667
Work it out, work it out,
work it out.

457
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,500
Okay, so I just have a question.

458
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,066
Do I have to do it from here,
or can I walk in

459
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,500
and then start from here?

460
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,934
Or does it have to be very,
like, "welcome?"

461
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:09,066
- You can walk in.
- Do I get a little...?

462
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,533
Hello, everybody.
My name is Carmen Carrera.

463
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:16,500
And I would--am so excited to
welcome you to work it out.

464
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
All right, ladies, we're ready
to pop a squat.

465
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,767
You're gonna work everybody's
favorite asset.

466
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:27,333
So we're gonna go down... up and
around.

467
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,700
Down again.
And up the other way.

468
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,100
- Cut for a minute.

469
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,066
Now Carmen, we're asking you to
make a connection with the

470
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,800
camera, but we're actually
making a connection

471
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,133
with your ass.

472
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,066
- Well, yeah.

473
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,233
- Hello, ladies.

474
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:45,066
I'm here to show you one of my
favorite workouts.

475
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:50,133
It's called the rubber tug.
Gonna lower it down, ladies.

476
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:54,734
One, two, three, four.

477
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:56,066
- It was a little low energy.

478
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,767
- Give me more face.
- Yes.

479
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,433
- You've gotta--
give me more of that.

480
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,000
- Inspire us to get up off
the couch.

481
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,567
- Okay.
What we're gonna do is

482
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,667
we're gonna place it under our
toe, ladies.

483
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,133
Pull up...
- Oh!

484
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,533
- And down...
- Ah, it doesn't matter.

485
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:11,100
- [laughing]
- One, two, three, four.

486
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,567
- I was actually--it was
exciting watching the girls back

487
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:17,000
there, 'cause they were camping
it up a little bit.

488
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,734
- When you're making a video,
you have to express your

489
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:22,266
personality, and you have to
convince.

490
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:25,600
And I didn't get that from
India.

491
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,767
- Hi.<i> </i>
<i>Hola!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> [speaking Spanish]</i>

492
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,433
'Cause you like Latin guy...
[claps]

493
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,433
You have to work your body,
darling.

494
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:37,200
If you don't understand me,
don't worry--I will include

495
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,800
a translation
at the end of the video.

496
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,266
- [laughing]
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>

497
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:47,000
You gonna step on the step, and
you gonna cha, cha,

498
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,934
<i>echar pa'lante!</i>

499
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,834
Cha, cha,<i> echar pa'lante!</i>

500
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,934
- I feel like I am making a
workout video with Uber-Charo.

501
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,333
- Oop-a!

502
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,200
- And we are going to go ahead
and show you how to keep a tight

503
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,600
snatch to make sure that you
keep your man so he don't have

504
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,767
to come and bother me, okay?

505
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,767
- Get to what you're doing,
don't tell me what you're doing.

506
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,667
- All right, first you put your
ball...

507
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,066
in a nice, delicate position.

508
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,400
And stretch.
Ah, and bring it back.

509
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,133
And stretch.
Do y'all feel that?

510
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,166
Ah!
- I liked Mariah.

511
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,400
She did not bring it,
she did not have conviction.

512
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,367
You're sitting in front of
RuPaul and you're a drag queen,

513
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,200
you better pull it together.

514
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,066
- All right, I feel like my
snatch has been aired out.

515
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,967
- Hey, ladies, my name is Delta.

516
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,433
We're gonna start with one of my
favorite exercises,

517
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,600
the shake and bake.

518
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,633
We're gonna start with the small
weight.

519
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,166
Squeeze your boobs together,
that's always a good asset.

520
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,533
One, two, three.

521
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,967
Now if you're working out with a
partner, have them stand behind

522
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,700
you and reach around.

523
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,734
They can give you
a little bit too.

524
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,066
It's so fun to work out with
a partner.

525
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:02,300
- You should go over-the-top
with the shake.

526
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,900
Over-the-top! You like it?
Get vicious.

527
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,467
- One, two, three.
- Yes!

528
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,900
- Like that.
See how that feels?

529
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,433
Do it like that!

530
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,467
If you've got enough, you can
stick it right down inside there

531
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,633
and you can jump up and down.

532
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:20,200
This challenge started off to be
my worst nightmare.

533
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,667
But this challenge is gonna be
my strongest success.

534
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:27,433
- Nice job, team Carmen.
- Thank you.

535
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:30,900
- Now, ladies... tomorrow night
on the main stage,

536
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,433
come dressed in an outfit
that features

537
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:35,200
your favorite body part.

538
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,400
Because along with Susan Powter,
our extra special guest judge

539
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,900
will be la-luminous,
la-legendary...

540
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,266
Latoya Jackson.

541
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,333
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.

542
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,900
This is unbelievable.
I love Latoya.

543
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,600
I would jump up and get her.
- Go hit the showers!

544
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,834
- All right.
- Another day.

545
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,400
- Good morning.
- We're back in the workroom,

546
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,500
and today's runway challenge is
to pick something from your

547
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,900
closet that accentuates your
favorite or your best body part.

548
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,066
- I am wearing a dress that's
just low-cut, because I'm gonna

549
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,300
show off my boobs.

550
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
- I'm doing titties too, girl.
- Okay, there we go.

551
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,600
- I think I've showed it
already, so I 'm just gonna wear

552
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,500
something complimentary.
- Chaps.

553
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,633
You have a pair of chaps over
there you

554
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,734
about to put on, Carmen?

555
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,066
- I don't wanna be known as the
naked one.

556
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:28,266
That's not really what I wanna
go for.

557
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,934
And it just keeps coming up.

558
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,100
So I'm gonna do something that
Carmen would do, but just

559
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,333
a different kind of Carmen.

560
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,867
- Should I start out with a
ruffle cone?

561
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,767
- Yeah.
And then take it off?

562
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,200
Girl, I'm not, like, a skinny
twig.

563
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,300
You know, like, I look like a
football player out of drag.

564
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
And I will never look
like a woman.

565
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,934
My drag, it's more clown
than anything.

566
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,767
Did you always go by India?
- Yeah.

567
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,667
- Yeah?
- My brother's ex-boyfriend at

568
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,066
the time was my drag mother.

569
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,066
He got me started and he gave me
the name India Ferrah.

570
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,200
- Oh, so your brother's gay?
- Yeah.

571
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,133
- That's great.
That's really good.

572
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,333
- My family's really supportive,
so.

573
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,667
- That's so great.

574
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,734
My biological family, they threw
me out of the house.

575
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,266
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

576
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:09,266
Through all this--this awful
things that have happened to me

577
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:12,266
in my life, laughter is a way--
it's a coping mechanism.

578
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:16,367
Because if you can laugh at it,
you can deal with it.

579
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,266
- I think I worry too much what
people think,

580
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:19,934
and I've gotta get over that.

581
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:22,533
I was a little nervous 'cause,
you know, I got picked last.

582
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,300
Back at home, I'm a whole lot
more out,

583
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,800
and open, and humorous.

584
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,233
I mean, I feel like I'm not
myself here.

585
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:32,066
I'm not used to such big
personalities.

586
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,100
- Just be strong.

587
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,500
I've been on your team twice
now.

588
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,200
I've never been disappointed.
- Thank you, girl.

589
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,100
Well, you work it out just as
much, honey.

590
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,266
- Oh, that's 'cause I work in
the spirit of hallelu.

591
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,300
[laughter]

592
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,367
- When I frst came out,
I was like, well, I guess

593
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,333
this is perfect timing
for me to become a drag queen.

594
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,467
If I'm gonna be a queer, I might
as well be, like, the queeriest.

595
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:52,934
- The queeriest, yeah.

596
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,567
My interest in drag was just
because I loved clothes

597
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,834
and fashion.

598
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,533
- How was high school for you?
- I was picked on,

599
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,066
I was really awkward, I was
a little on the heavy side.

600
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:03,667
In my generation of growing up,

601
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,433
gay was just kind of disgusting
and kind of a subculture,

602
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,900
and drag kind of came
and saved me.

603
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,066
But it was hard.

604
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,367
I grew up in a very, like, Latin
neighborhood.

605
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,600
- You're in California?
- Mmm-hmm.

606
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,533
- So where'd you grow up?

607
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,066
- Gainesville, Georgia.

608
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:20,700
It's not a progressive city as
far as the thought process.

609
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,367
I didn't feel like there was
something wrong with me;

610
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,100
I just knew that people were
picking on me.

611
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,700
Kids don't understand that being
different

612
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,367
ultimately means you're gonna
become something special.

613
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,300
Even if you don't have, like, a
strong support system at home,

614
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,266
you have to get that
from within.

615
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,200
<i>[laughter]</i>

616
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,533
<i>- And what?</i>

617
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,100
Hey, guys.

618
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,633
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

619
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:03,667
Michelle Visage, hello, my dear.
- Hi, gorgeous.

620
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,233
- And I wanna welcome to the
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> family my good pal</i>

621
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,500
and makeup superstar, Billy B.

622
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,166
Hi, honey.
- Hey.

623
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,400
- I'm so glad you could get away
from Gaga to be with us.

624
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,200
- Thank you.
- And Susan Powter.

625
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,967
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.

626
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,367
- Thank you.

627
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:26,667
- And the multi-faceted yet
complex talents of Miss Latoya

628
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,767
Jackson is in the house tonight!

629
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,767
- Hello, gorgeous!
How are you?

630
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,300
- I am so happy you're here.
Welcome to my home.

631
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,734
- Why, thank you.

632
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:39,233
- This week, we challenged our
queens to make totally leotarded

633
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,467
workout videos.

634
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,734
Tonight, they're dressed to show
it off

635
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:46,266
and ready to pump you up.

636
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:52,700
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!

637
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:57,967
Raja!
- Not a stitch of makeup on.

638
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,800
- None.
<i>- I've chosen my legs.</i>

639
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,166
<i>My inspiration for my outfit</i>
<i>was a milf/cougar who is sort</i>

640
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:07,066
<i>of waiting poolside for the</i>
<i>pool boy to come clean it up.</i>

641
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:10,600
- Nothing tastes as good as
skinny feels.

642
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,834
Manila.
It's very Manila Deville.

643
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:18,500
<i>- I wanna show off my face, so</i>
<i>I'm wearing a strapless dress,</i>

644
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,133
<i>pulling my hair up, so it's</i>
<i>very, like, "look at me."</i>

645
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,467
- She looks like Erte a bit too.

646
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,233
- Yes, it's very Erte.

647
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,266
- It's got bride of Frankenstein
in there too.

648
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:28,600
- Yes, his second wife.

649
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,767
Next up, Stacy Layne Matthews,

650
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,433
from back swamp to the main
stage.

651
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:36,934
<i>- My fat ass,</i>
<i>I'm gonna pull out</i>

652
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,700
<i>the skimpiest top that shows</i>

653
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,767
<i>off the biggest part of my</i>
<i>body, which is my tits.</i>

654
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:45,333
- Add a little R&amp;B in there.
- Rear and boobs. R&amp;B.

655
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:49,133
This is India Ferrah.
- Ooh, Rapunzel.

656
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,066
- X marks the spot.

657
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,800
<i>- I honestly chose the</i>
<i>see-through catsuit because it</i>

658
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
<i>shows my whole body.</i>

659
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,734
<i>I don't think anyone will have</i>
<i>trouble seeing my titties.</i>

660
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,200
<i>I mean, that's my favorite</i>
<i>body part.</i>

661
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,367
- Not a shy girl.

662
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,367
- She is training the ponies at
the circus.

663
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,600
- I think it needs a whip
though, for real.

664
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,967
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

665
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,233
- Look at those hips!

666
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,734
<i>- My best feature is</i>
<i>everything.</i>

667
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:15,700
<i>I'm gonna serve you hair,</i>
<i>face, hips, everything.</i>

668
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,066
- I love the glitter.
The sparkle is great.

669
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,667
- I'm blinded by her beauty.

670
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,633
Up next, Mimi Imfurst.

671
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,633
- Mimi in the leopard!
Isn't it Bette Midler?

672
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,200
- It is Miss Kitty.

673
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,667
<i>- I love my dress.</i>
<i>It's high camp, it's glamour.</i>

674
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,567
<i>And I think it's something</i>
<i>the judges haven't seen before.</i>

675
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,800
- Wow.

676
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,200
- Very slimming,
the butt looks good.

677
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,367
- Meow, meow.

678
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:43,533
- Up next, Shangela Laquifa
Wadley.

679
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:49,567
- Pull up to the bumper.
- Oh! Oh! Yes!

680
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,433
<i>- I choose to highlight my</i>
<i>shoulders.</i>

681
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:54,333
<i>The outfit that I had that</i>
<i>showcases my shoulders is one</i>

682
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,266
<i>I've had a little bit up my</i>
<i>sleeve.</i>

683
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,734
- She's giving you a little
Kardashian.

684
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,433
- She's giving Kardashian.

685
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,467
- She's the forgotten
Kardashian.

686
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,767
- This is Kiki Kardashian.

687
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:07,066
They call this queen Mariah.

688
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,667
- Bring the drama, Mariah.
- The elegance of brown.

689
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,066
- I love the hair.

690
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,600
And all the colors are
coordinating, aren't they?

691
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,100
<i>- My outfit, it complimented my</i>
<i>mood so much.</i>

692
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,667
<i>It was flowy, airy, sexy.</i>

693
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:22,066
- Milk chocolate is what it is.
- Milk does a body good.

694
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:25,800
Up next, Delta Work.
- Work.

695
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,767
- Ooh!
- All right, Delta.

696
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,133
- She looks like Delta Burke,
doesn't she?

697
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,900
<i>- I am geared up</i>
<i>for the judges.</i>

698
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,533
<i>I am ready to show the twins.</i>

699
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,900
<i>And I know that they're gonna</i>
<i>fall in love with my look.</i>

700
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,100
- Priscilla Presley happening
in there.

701
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,400
- A southern girl.
- John Waters would love her.

702
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,233
- I love that hair.
- Mm-hmm.

703
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:45,767
- Yara Sofia.
- Her legs are gorgeous.

704
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,233
Look at that.
<i>- I chose a short dress.</i>

705
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:51,166
<i>It is simple, but I am showing</i>
<i>my legs.</i>

706
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,467
- Is she wearing stockings?
Those are her legs!

707
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:56,467
- Those are her eyes.
- She bought them.

708
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,233
- She has the receipt.
- Carmen Carrera.

709
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:02,100
Oh, she's all grown up.
- Seductress.

710
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,300
<i>- I wanna show the judges</i>
<i>that I am versatile.</i>

711
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,433
<i>This beautiful gown is gonna</i>
<i>show off my beautiful ass.</i>

712
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,433
- All about Jersey right now.

713
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,934
- She's Jersey-licious
right there.

714
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,400
- Yes, ma'am.

715
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,834
Welcome, dolls.

716
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:19,667
Earlier, the judges screened
your workout videos.

717
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,333
You competed as teams,

718
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:27,967
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.

719
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:32,300
Will the following queens
please step forward?

720
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,700
Stacy Layne Matthews,
Mimi Imfurst,

721
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,100
Yara Sofia, India Ferrah,

722
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:50,200
Alexis Mateo, Mariah.

723
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,133
Ladies...

724
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:57,700
you represent the best
and the worst of the week.

725
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,667
Raja, Manila,

726
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,400
Shangela, Carmen, Delta.

727
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,567
Good job this week, ladies.

728
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:10,567
You're all safe.
Leave the stage.

729
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:11,633
Now.

730
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,633
Ladies, it's time to face
the judges.

731
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,400
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.

732
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,900
Let's go to Miss Latoya Jackson.

733
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,867
- I love anything that sparkles,
of course.

734
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:29,400
And you are one sparkle.
It's just absolutely beautiful.

735
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,567
- Your look has, like, a moment
of retro Barbra Streisand

736
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,967
Hollywood glamour.

737
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,367
- As far as the video goes,

738
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,500
it was very Puerto Rican
Chrissy Snow.

739
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,300
- Yes! She was!
- From<i> Three's Company!</i>

740
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,467
- Yes!
- I thought that was

741
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,667
so different and clever
at the same time.

742
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,567
- Your one of the first
contestants

743
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,500
who brought real humor.

744
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,667
- Thank you, Alexis.

745
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,066
Next, Mimi Imfurst.

746
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:56,734
- Your video was much more
of a comedy skit.

747
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:59,400
<i>- Today we're gonna help you</i>
<i>find you.</i>

748
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,100
- You don't have to pull every
drag trick out of the hat

749
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,867
every single time.

750
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,400
- The video was a little bit
of a let-down.

751
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
It was like Divine meets
Sally Struthers.

752
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,266
- I really wanted to come in and
create a large character.

753
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,667
You know, I try to put the B
in subtle.

754
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,834
- It was hokey.
It was not good.

755
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:21,300
- I feel like you wasted
an opportunity.

756
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Thank you, Mimi.
- Thank you.

757
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,066
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

758
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,300
I guess I don't have to ask you

759
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,333
what body part you're featuring
tonight.

760
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,467
- You look so much like my
relatives.

761
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,967
Is she related and I don't know
it?

762
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,900
- The back swamp Jacksons.
- [giggles]

763
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,100
- I have to say, having eaten
chicken in your workout segment,

764
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,066
you actually made us laugh
with you.

765
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,066
- And to incorporate that
into an exercise,

766
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,867
I think you did an excellent job
on what you had to do.

767
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,500
- Thank you.
- I liked it.

768
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,333
I like what she did.

769
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,867
- What I really loved was seeing
a personality.

770
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:54,400
We need more of you, Stacy.
- India Ferrah.

771
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
- It's the hat with the feather,
and the ponytail to

772
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,166
the floor, and the glitter lips.

773
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,834
Your boobs out with Xs and a
tarantula or something

774
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:05,600
on your vajayjay...
there is so much going on.

775
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,066
I think, "well, what is she
covering up?"

776
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,066
- Is every outfit gonna be the
bosoms featured?

777
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,800
Because that's what we've gotten
three weeks in a row.

778
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,066
- Okay.

779
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:18,367
- As far as your workout,
I wasn't inspired.

780
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,367
I didn't feel that connection.

781
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:23,467
- There was nothing. There
wasn't even a joke.

782
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,700
It was nervous.
- You could tell she was scared.

783
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,767
<i>- Looking at the video, what</i>

784
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,300
<i>would you have done</i>
<i>differently?</i>

785
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,367
- You know, more inspirational
words.

786
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,867
- It's not just the words.

787
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:35,567
Inspiration has to come from a
sincere place inside of you.

788
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,066
Thank you, India.
- Thank you.

789
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:42,900
- Yara Sofia.
You took a potential liability,

790
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,734
which is your accent, and you
made it work for you.

791
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:48,100
- That whole Latin thing and
that sexy swish,

792
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,133
you had everyone roaring.

793
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,800
-<i> Echar pa'lante!</i>

794
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,567
<i>If you want that guy, you have</i>
<i>to work it out, darling.</i>

795
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,333
- I think you are so hot.

796
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,700
I just have a problem,
outfit-wise.

797
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,800
- I can take it off if you want.

798
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,133
- [laughs]

799
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:04,333
Well, thank you very much,
darling.

800
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,200
Up next, Mariah.

801
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,066
What body part were you
featuring?

802
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,433
- My face.

803
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,834
- I love the fact that all the
different browns coordinate

804
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:13,934
with you quite well.

805
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,300
And they work.

806
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,066
- And then there's, like, this
Vegas makeup

807
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,667
that I think cheapens you,

808
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,467
and I think you're too pretty
for that.

809
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,066
- During the workout video,
I think your own sincerity

810
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:28,233
didn't shine through, and we the
audience didn't believe you.

811
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,266
- If you could think of your
personality

812
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:33,700
as your face, get that same
confidence,

813
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,266
it will take you to another
level, and that's the truth.

814
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,533
- Well, girls,
we have heard enough.

815
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:46,900
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the interior

816
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,200
illusions lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.

817
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,867
You may leave the stage.

818
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,567
Okay, now just between us girls.

819
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,433
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.

820
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,300
- I think she nailed
the bloody workout.

821
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,633
- I thought she was
the funniest one.

822
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,133
- Yeah.
- I like the energy.

823
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:08,433
- You worked in a workout video.

824
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,266
- Yes, I did.
- Was it difficult for you?

825
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:13,934
- It was, because unlike Susan,
I had never worked out before.

826
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,500
And I still don't work out
this day.

827
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,533
So I think once you start-- my
sister, she has to do it all

828
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,867
the time because
that's what she does.

829
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,233
- Right.
Let's move on to Mimi Imfurst.

830
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,533
The workout she did,
it wasn't funny.

831
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:27,100
- It was stupid.
- [laughing]

832
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,400
- Seriously.

833
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,133
- Right, it'd be a different
story if her shtick had

834
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:31,500
inspired us or at least made us
laugh.

835
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,767
- That's what I'm saying.

836
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,266
- Thing is, Mimi's always been
teetering

837
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,533
throughout the competition.

838
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,300
And I think she may have gone to
the other side.

839
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,266
Stacy Layne Matthews.

840
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,700
During her workout routine,
something was coming out.

841
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,633
- I know!
- There was potential.

842
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,600
- I like the fact that she made
fun of herself.

843
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,667
However, I don't feel that she
has what it takes to be

844
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,166
the next drag queen.

845
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,600
I just don't think so.

846
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,133
- Will she be in the bottom two?

847
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,867
That's the question.
India Ferrah.

848
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,734
- I hated the way
that she looked.

849
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,100
- I liked her so much.
I liked her.

850
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,266
- She's got a good energy.

851
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,934
She tried to do the double
entendre

852
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:12,266
with the rubber and the double X
magnum thing.

853
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:14,400
It just came off dirty
and not clever.

854
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,734
- Bottom line is,
her workout was boring.

855
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:18,834
- Yara.

856
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,467
Now what she did in that workout
was hilarious.

857
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:24,900
Who knew that she would do that?
- She's very sexy.

858
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,066
- Yes.
- Extremely sexy.

859
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,500
- She needs to burn
that dress though.

860
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,934
- You have it out for her
and that dress.

861
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:33,700
- I hated the dress too.
- Mariah.

862
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,834
I wasn't crazy about the snatch
tightening thing.

863
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:37,734
- It was like, eh.

864
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,066
- It was gay cruise humor.

865
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,367
- And the delivery wasn't good.
- Not at all.

866
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,734
- She has a beautiful face.

867
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,700
- For this title,
pretty isn't enough.

868
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,500
- All right...
[claps]

869

Welcome back, ladies.

I've made some decisions.

874
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:16,233
Yara Sofia, your joy and
enthusiasm need no translation.

875
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:20,400
Condragulations, you're safe
from elimination.

a new workout craze.

880
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:38,734
You are the winner of this

You will receive a $2,500 gift

Yes, that's gilt.com.

884

Thank you, Alexis.

885
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,734
- Thank you guys so much.

886
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,066
- India Ferrah...

887
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:03,433
On the runway, your look
was too much.

888
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:08,066
In the challenge,
you gave too little.

889
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:12,667
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

890
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,500
<i>- My knees start shaking, and</i>
<i>I'm just standing there like,</i>

"oh, my god, what am I gonna
do?"

892
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,066
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

893
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:26,500
In your challenge, you ate
the scenery...literally.

894
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,600
And you made us laugh with you.

895
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:36,333
But still, we feel you are
holding back.

896
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:39,233
Condragulations, you're safe...
for now.

897
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,233
- I'll bring it.

898
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,934
<i>I think RuPaul gave me</i>
<i>a second chance.</i>

899
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,400
And I just want to be more open
and be myself

900
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,367
so people can actually see who I
really am.

901
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:55,066
- Mariah...

902
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,967
you are a bronze beauty.

903
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:02,433
But your workout performance
was pale.

904
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:05,233
Mimi Imfurst...

905
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:10,066
you showed us your glamorous
side on the runway.

906
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:14,600
But in the challenge, your
slapstick got sloppy.

907
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:21,700
Mariah, condragulations,
you're safe.

908
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,400
- Thank you so much.

909
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,734
- Mimi Imfurst...

910
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,567

means you are up for

911

Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me

917
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,166
and save yourself
from elimination.

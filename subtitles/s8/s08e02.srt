that your missteps

29

I am the least put together.

Her look is very plain.

-It sucked.

Hearing the judges' critiques,

59
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,967
I definitely need to do more
to stand out.

60
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:17,867
Wipe her away, girl.

61
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,166

were you gagged

68
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,700
that I was not
in the bottom two?

69
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,967
I had to say something.

70
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,100
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I do not think</i>

71
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,834
that a lot of the girls
really deserved to be safe.

72

"I honestly have no idea
who they're gonna pick."

80
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,934
I don't blame Laila
for being salty

81
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,200

292

it--it can be a lot,

293
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,266

I got this.

294

-Yeah.
-No, you're gonna be out there.

317
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,100
-But the rest--
-Whatever.

318
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,533
Well, we should probably
set it instead of "whatever."

319
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's get beyond "whatever."

320
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,133

00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,200
but girl,
these girls cannot dance.

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,100
Boom, boom.

350
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,367
Wait, we're now--
we're robot-ing.

351
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,300
Okay, simple.

352
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,100
One, two, three, four,
turn and down, down.

353
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,433
It look crazy.

354
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,533
I'm just trying to fucking

355
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,066
get your visual in my head
so I can have it.

356
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,867
-Do it, bitch, do it.
-Three, four, five, six, seven.

357
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:34,967
-That's it.
-One, two, three, four, five.

358
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,333
No, five, six, seven,
eight is just a turn.

359
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,066
Don't move on five, six,
seven, eight at all.

360
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,400
We should change it if
you can't get it.

361
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,133
What the eff?
It's simple.

362
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,333
One, two, three, four, turn.

363
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,467
One, two,
three, four,

364
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,867
five, six, seven, eight.

365
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:48,800
-Is that--
-Got it.

366
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,367
The hands weren't the same,
but fuck it.

367
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,066
We got to move on.

368
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,066
You ready?

369
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,867
♪ One shot, one shot
of adrenaline, adrenaline ♪

370
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,066
I don't know.

371
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,500
We're doing it.
It's happening.

372
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,467
All right, girl.

373
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,066
Can you just give me a shot,
and I'll flip out?

374
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,066
I'll do the second one.

375
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,633
And I'll punch you
in the face--boom!

376
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,400
See, you trying to get
out of the choreography.

377
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,066
-Bitch, you trying to do comedy.
-I can do all of it.

378
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,867
If we're standing there,
"One shot,"

379
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,967
five beats of silence,
it's boring.

380
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't want you to do
that punch thing.

381
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,533
I just want you to, like--

382
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:17,633
Okay.

383
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,200
Chi Chi does not get funny,

384
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,367
<i>and I'm, like, a comedy queen,</i>
<i>so I'm like,</i>

385
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,567
<i>"Okay, you know what?</i>

386
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm gonna do it anyway.

387
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,867
I don't care, bitch,
it'd be funny."

388
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,400
All right,
so shall we move on

389
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
and do it again,
or do you want to stand here?

390
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,934
We'll get it.

391
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,934
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

392
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,567
<i>These bitches getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>

393
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,100
They getting on my nerves now.

394
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,567
All right, Lady Bitches,
are you ready?

395
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,066
Kim, I feel like you're
the one who is kind of,

396
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,433
like, nerdy and not cool.

397
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,533
Yeah.

398
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,834
-Regina George.
-I'm the ringleader.

399
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,700
I think you should be,
like, her kid sister.

400
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,200
You do exactly
whatever she does,

401
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,100
just not as good
as she does it.

402
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,433
Aw, Laila's my impersonator.

403
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,133
-That's cute.
-Yeah.

404
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,066
My biggest concern
is that I'm gonna

405
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:04,400
fade into the background
comparatively

406
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,300
<i>to all the other girls,</i>

407
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,400
<i>so I'm not sure</i>
<i>about playing the,</i>

408
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,300
like, little sister, like,
wannabe Derrick Barry,

409
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,166
'cause I probably wouldn't be
the best Britney impersonator.

410
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,066
Look at this
giant fucking heel.

411
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,533
-Yeah.
-Those are so cute.

412
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,066
Bitch, I hope y'all can dance
in them high-ass heels.

413
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,066
You need something
this size, hon.

414
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,266
-That's like a--four inches.
-No, ma'am.

415
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,533
Have you ever, guys,
been in proper shows before

416
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,900
where you have to learn
choreography and stuff?

417
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,867
When I was a kid, yes.
Like, for years.

418
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,166
Just--oh,
when you were younger.

419
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,934
So you don't really
know how to, like,

420
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,533
just focus
and get it done?

421
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,333
Yeah, I do.

422
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,367
'Cause we're
talking about shoes.

423
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,166
I would love to,
like, save the time

424
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,600
and figure out
what we're doing.

425
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,734
This is how
the group's gonna down.

426
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,734
"So what'd you guys do?"

427
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:46,900
"Well, we spent time talking

428
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
about how comfortable
these shoes were."

429
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,567
-We're not going down.
-No.

430
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:50,934
My worry with this group

431
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,300
is that I might be the only
one that's gonna give it

432
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,066
and the other girls are just
gonna take me down with them.

433
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:59,900
<i>Chi Chi needs to step up</i>
<i>and get us together.</i>

434
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,066
So we all know our lip syncs
somewhat? Like, the words?

435
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,133
-Ish.
-Mm-hmm.

436
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,400
I think that's gonna be
the most important part

437
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,967
so when we meet the
choreographer

438
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,100
we can kind of just take
in what he's saying.

439
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,200
You're, like,
looking at me like

440
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,233
I'm Charlie Brown's teacher.

441
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,066
Wah, wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah.

442
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,300
Wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah.

443
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,066
-You're done?
-No, I'm not done.

444
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,200
Definitely not done.

445
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,100
I just want to be good.

446
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,166
My biggest fear
in this challenge

447
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,367
<i>is these girls flopping</i>

448
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,066
and me having
to take the fall

449
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,433
for my whole team.

450
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Hey, kitty girls.

451
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,600
-Hey, Ru.
-[all] Hi!

452
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,233
How are my
little treble makers?

453
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,600
-We're working it out.
-Yeah.

454
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
-Cynthia Lee.
-Hi, RuPaul.

455
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,900
What's the name of your group?

456
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,467
My name
of my group is--

457
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,333
You've got to look at a paper
to get the name of your group?

458
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,967
-Lady Bitches.
-Yes, ma'am.

459
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,300
So what--
did you have a strategy

460
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,900
in choosing these ladies?

461
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,066
Actually, yes,
'cause I got dancers.

462
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,567
I got the comedians one,

463
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,066
the actors, makeup artists.

464
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,533
Now, Kim Chi,
this is a lip-sync challenge.

465
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,934
Are you a lip-sync artist?

466
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,834
I think I am,
but my biggest problem

467
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:11,066
is sometimes when I lip-synch
my lisp comes through.

468
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,133
-I'm not mad at a lisp.
-Yeah.

469
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,066
In fact,
I'm partial to a lisp.

470
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,900
My empire was built on a lisp.

471
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,367
-Really.
-Absolutely.

472
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,500
Are you familiar with
the movie "Pitch Perfect?"

473
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,667
I've never heard of it
or even know what it's about.

474
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,200
I was probably in Korea
at the time.

475
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,633
Well, it just came out, uh,
six months ago.

476
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,500
[laughter]

477
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,233
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

478
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,633
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

479
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,100
So now, Laila,

480
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,834
why do you think you wound up
in the bottom two?

481
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,500
Well,
the photo with Mathu

482
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,333
<i>was definitely</i>
<i>less than amazing.</i>

483
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,567
Right, because, you know,
you were scrunched over.

484
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,533
You weren't shining through.

485
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,467
How are you gonna shine through
in this challenge?

486
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,600
I ain't gonna
be squatting down

487
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,900
and sitting in the back.

488
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm gonna come forward
and be present.

489
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,967
Well, you know,
a lot of girls say that.

490
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,900
There's more strategy
to it than that.

491
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
-You realize that?
-Yes, ma'am.

492
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,066
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>I need to bring myself up</i>

493
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,934
<i>to the level</i>
<i>of the other girls</i>

494
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,533
so I can be like,
"I'm here too."

495
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,600
It's not just them.
I am here.

496
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,900
Listen, I am
so excited for this,

497
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,600
and we're gonna see
the real crème de la crème

498
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,133
rise to the top, all right?

499
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,333
Oh, she's coming back?

500
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,066
She's coming back.

501
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,200
All right, get to work.

502
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
-Thank you.
-All right.

503
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,567
-Thanks, lady.
-Whoo.

504
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,633
Well, all right, now.

505
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,066
-Hey.
-Hi, Ru.

506
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,467
-Hi, Ru.
-Are y'all the Shady Bitches?

507
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,133
Yes, we are.

508
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,100
Are there any shady bitches
in this group?

509
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,567
Oh, okay, well,
there you have it.

510
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,467
Now, Chi Chi,
you from Louisiana.

511
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,867
Louisiana, baby.

512
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,300
You know, both my parents
are from Louisiana.

513
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,633
Yes, I enjoy being
a country queen.

514
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,567
I mean, who doesn't like
an old smoked turkey neck, baby?

515
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,066
[laughter]

516
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,967
Now, Chi Chi,
you're the leader.

517
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,133
How are you navigating all
of these strong personalities?

518
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:50,467
I'm finding them
a little bit difficult.

519
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,500
Really?
Are you for real?

520
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm for real.

521
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,333
I've never had to deal
with such big personalities,

522
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,467
and back home I'm the star,

523
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,567
so to get this many
stars in one room?

524
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,233
It's just, like, girl.

525
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,867
Okay, well, is anybody
afraid of choreography?

526
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:05,667
No.

527
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,900
She didn't like my comedic
take of a punch in the face.

528
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
No, ma'am.

529
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm always been,
like, putting in

530
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,500
my little comedic
chime in there,

531
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,333
but you're shutting it down,

532
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,066
so I'm probably
gonna do it anyway

533
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,633
regardless of
what Chi Chi says.

534
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,066
I prefer the whole thing
to be choreographed.

535
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:19,967
I feel safer,

536
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,467
and I think
I'm having a hard time

537
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,967
getting her to actually
put down the steps.

538
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,166
Maybe you should be
more of a tyrant.

539
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,200
I cannot be a tyrant.

540
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,166
That's not in my blood.

541
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,700
I think I'll give that part
to Acid Betty.

542
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,867
-Oh.
-Yeah.

543
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,166
Are you a tyrant,
Acid Betty?

544
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,066
No, I haven't showed
that side yet.

545
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:37,867
Girl.

546
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:40,233
She's the leader,
so I'm letting her
kind of make decisions.

547
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,600
All right,
get back to work,

548
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,967
and knock 'em dead.

549
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,567
-All right. Thanks.
-Thank you.

550
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,066
Let's get this work done.

551
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,200
All right, ladies,
gather round.

552
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,266
Now, if at any time

553
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:58,367
during this competition
you feel the need

554
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,166
to get something
off your chesticles--

555
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,900
yes, take advantage
of the Shade Tree.

556
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,934
-Uh-oh.
-Oh.

557
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,667
<i>Think of it as a diary room</i>

558
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:11,400
where you can say whatever
you want in total privacy.

559
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,367
-[all] Ooh.

560
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,934
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

561
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,166
-All right?
-[all] All right.

562
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,233
Hey, hey, hey,
Team Lady Bitches.

563
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,967
We're ladies,
and we're bitches.

564
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,633
My team are setting up
to met Jamal.

565
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,967
I'm so excited about that.

566
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,967
He's a sexy--mmm--
chocolate flavor.

567
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,133
[laughs]
[record scratches]

568
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,367
Did my teeths look yellow?
No.

569
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,033
Let me something
y'all put together.

570
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,000
We have, like,
a pose that we do,

571
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,667
which is, like,
a one, two, look pose.

573

574
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,166
We like to incorporate
our little move.

575
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,100
Uh-huh,
it's--I--I see it.

576
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,934
Jamal's
pretty much like,

577
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,633
"Oh, well, that's cute,
but no."

578
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,066
You guys are Lady Bitches,

579
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,533
and so I really want
to present you guys

580
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,166
dancing very up,
very, you know,

581
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,800
trained and very precise
and classic.

582
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,400
So let's start
from the top, yeah?

583
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,333
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

584
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,367
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

585
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,934
Let me see you do it.

586
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:26,467
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

587
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,767
Kim Chi
is the worst dancer...

588
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,667
Whoops.

589
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,166
In "Drag Race" history.

590
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,600
-[both]
One, two, three, four.

591
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,800
<i>We're not doing crazy stuff.</i>

592
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,934
We're not pirouetting
and back flipping.

593
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,900
Step, touch,

594
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,166
<i>and not only that,</i>
<i>it's the first move.</i>

595
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,266
We're fucked.

596
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:47,133
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

597
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,967
All right,
something's going on here.

598
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,834
Yeah, I'm, like,
losing it with the arms.

599
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,734
-I'm trying to--
-Yeah.

600
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:54,066
Don't think about the arms.
Let's get the feet first.

601
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,266
-Okay, right first or--
-Right first.

602
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:59,066
It's profoundly difficult
to try and do all these steps

603
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,367
<i>but then also I have to think,</i>

604
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,500
"I need to stand out
as a character."

605
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,567
Let me have you two
do it by yourselves.

606
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,934
Don't be--one, two.

607
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,166
Okay, can we--
can we start over.

608
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,100
I'm so sorry.

609
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,333
-All right.
-Don't be--

610
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,867
-[both]
Jealous of my boogie.

611
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,533
Three, four, five.
Okay, listen.

612
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,133
One, two, three, four.

613
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,667
All right, and right now

614
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,233

all over again.

Don't be afraid.

619
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,867
Right now you're
looking like this.

620
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:29,467
Let it go, all right?
Here we go.

621
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,700
Five, six, seven.

Uh-oh.

sweetie?

627

<i>Kim Chi falls,</i>

628
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,967
and just my heart
drops out of my cuckoo.

629
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:44,700
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

630
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
Kim Chi,
are you sure you want
to keep doing it in heels?

631
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,066
-100%.
-Okay.

632
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,266
She need to nail this

633
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:53,533
because if she falls tomorrow
in front of the judges live,

634
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,367
we are completely done.

635
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,066

<i>I'm ready for him to just</i>
<i>give us some structure</i>

639
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,967
to this dance routine
that I've come up with.

640
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,100
Show me what you got.

641
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,834
Well, what about this?

642
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,533

All right, guys.

651
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,433
So you guys have
a lot of good ideas,

652
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:31,200
and I think we could kind of
clean 'em up and make 'em...

653
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,367
-Together.
-Cohesive.

654
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,934
"Cohesive" is the word.

655
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm so happy that we have
a little bit of choreography

656
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,066

Chi Chi,

657
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,066
<i>because now we're with Jamal,</i>

658
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,066

using our choreography.

00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,667

be careful with that.

665

Yeah, that's what
I said right away.

666
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,333
I was like,
"Why are we shooting drugs?"

667
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,300

691
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,133
and I was like,
"Eat it."

692
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,166

00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,600
It's about commitment.

715
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,633
Sweat flying, hair dripping,

716
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,266
whatever, it doesn't matter.

717
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:29,066
As long as you commit,
you're in it, okay?

718
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,567
How you feeling?

719
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,133
I mean, I'm shaky on it,
but I got to

720
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,567
go through it a few times
and I'll get it.

721
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,367
Like, that's how I work.

722
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,400
Like, I don't pick up
choreography super quick.

723
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,266
Like, if I think while
I'm dancing, I can't do it.

724
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:41,066
I get really in here,

725
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,200
and it just becomes
all fucked up, so...

726
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,233
Dax's attitude was
really off-putting to me

727
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,867
just because it didn't feel like
she really wanted to do it.

728
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,834
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of insecurity there</i>

729
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,266
when it comes
to the choreography.

730
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,500
You have to push yourself
on this one,

731
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,700
'cause we don't have
a lot of time.

732
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,500
Totally.

733
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,066
It means a lot
for me to be here,

734
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,066
<i>and I don't want to have</i>
<i>to go back to Savannah</i>

735
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:01,433
and find some shitty day job
picking up dog shit

736
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:05,333
or, you know, just doing random
sporadic shows in dive bars.

737
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,367
Like, I want to take
over the world,

738
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,633
<i>and I want to do it now,</i>
<i>and I want to do it with drag,</i>

739
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,567
so I will make it work.

740
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,533
I'm a little nervous,
I'm not gonna lie.

741
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,166
We didn't get
all the way through, so...

742
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,333
<i>So rehearsal is over,</i>

743
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:21,266
and the Lady Bitches are
in a little bit of trouble.

744
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,934
<i>Kim Chi seems a little too</i>
<i>in her head to pull this off,</i>

745
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,567
<i>and nobody's expecting her</i>

746
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,233
<i>to be the best</i>
<i>dancer in the room,</i>

747
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,300
but she's thinking that,

748
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,333
and that's
what's messing her up.

749
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,266
I remember the choreography,
but my only problem is hitting,

750
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,900
like, the points, like,
at the right time, so.

751
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,934
We can help you with that.

752
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:37,967
One thing we can't do

753
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,467
is teach you
that rhythm in a day.

754
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,266
Yeah.

755
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,433
But you can, like,
just live in your character,

756
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,600
and like,
if you're offbeat,

757
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,533
just be like--what happened?

758
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,967
'Cause then you're funny.

759
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,166
We're all, like,
rallying around.

760
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,967
We're like, "Kim Chi,
you can do this,"

761
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:54,266
but Kim Chi is being really,
like, down on herself.

762
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:57,066
I just really wish, like,
I could hit the beats.

763
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:57,900
They said last week

764
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,633
that they love
that you're a nerd.

765
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,133
You'll be fine.

766
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,300
[Kim Chi]<i> I am so nervous</i>
<i>about tomorrow.</i>

767
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,200
I really don't want
to let my group down.

768
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,700
Everyone has been
super, super helpful

769
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,133
guiding me through all of this.

770
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,266
<i>I'm not ready to go home yet.</i>

771
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:19,700
I have so many looks and ideas
that I want to showcase.

772
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
Man.

773
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm just gonna try my best
and do what I always do.

774
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,533
Uh, uh-uh, uh.

775
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,100
Uh, uh-uh, and stop.

776
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,066
You all okay?

777
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,533
-You guys hot?
-Yes, very.

778
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,100
That means we're
putting in work.

779
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,066
Yeah, that'd be great.

780
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,400
Yeah, do you have
any paper towels?

781
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,433
-Y'all need to focus.
-What?

782
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,066
Y'all need to focus
on what y'all doing.

783
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,533
I think I'm doing
a good job, you know.

784
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,233
Yeah, do a good job
or you're gonna have to

785
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,200
lip-synch against me.

786
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,066
Why do you think you're
gonna be in the bottom?

787
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,066
'Cause I'm the team captain.

788
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,200
They're gonna say,
"The team captain

789
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,133
"should have had everybody

790
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,467
at her's--at her level."

791
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,200
Yes, but I'll be
the first person

792
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
to be like, "Mm, she did a
fucking good job as captain."

793
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,467
'Cause she gonna
throw me under the bus.

794
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,800
Fuck yeah,
I'll be honest as fuck.

795
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,066
-She was--
-What'd I do?

796
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,934
You were like, "At least
I can lip-synch for myself.

797
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,133
I know I was gonna be all that."

798
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,467
That's what you did.

799
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:16,400
But then I
pulled it back together.

800
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,333
She pulled
the team together, yeah.

801
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,100
You can say
that if they ask me.

802
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,066
Exactly.

803
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,066
Betty is being
so negative,

804
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,400
and, like, counterproductive,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God.

805
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,433
This is so stupid."

806
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,333
It is what it is.

807
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,600
Just hope you're not
lip-synching

808
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,433
against me, darling.

809
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,934
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to coddle this girl.</i>

810
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,567
We're both on this
competition together.

811
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,900
When that bus comes by,
I'm gonna throw her first.

812
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,500
I told her that too.

813
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,900
-Oh.
-Shady Bitches.

814
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,667
Ooh, we're gonna kill
the Shady Ladies.

815
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,900
Oh, my goodness.

816
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,867
Time to get styling.

817
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,367
<i>Today's elimination day.</i>

818
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,967
<i>This the first time we're</i>
<i>performing for the judges.</i>

819
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:56,066
I'm very nervous.

820
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,166
How did your group's
rehearsal go?

821
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,066
It went well.

822
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:01,100
I was nervous
as fuck at first,

823
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,400
but I have to understand
that everybody's not a dancer,

824
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,333
and everybody's not gonna
catch on as fast as me,

825
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,400
so I can't be
frustrated about it.

826
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,066
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah.

827
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,166
This challenge--when I first
got it, I'm like, "Oh, my God.

828
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,600
This is, like,
my biggest nightmare."

829
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
Everybody's not
a born dancer.

830
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,500
Yeah.

831
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,066
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I was definitely an outsider.</i>

832
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:23,867
The weird, fat art kid

833
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:26,567
<i>who had a strong lisp</i>
<i>and a strong accent,</i>

834
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,367
<i>and that's why</i>
<i>I just really never learned</i>

835
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,066
<i>how to dance</i>
<i>and never learned how to,</i>

836
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,367
like, feel the music.

837
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,266
I used to be 350 pounds.

838
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,533
-350?
-Jesus.

839
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:36,967
Yeah.

840
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,133
-Until about 3 1/2 years ago.
-[both] Wow.

841
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,433
Obviously, like, I'm not
as fat as I was before,

842
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,100
but the fat kid is,
like, still in me.

843
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,600
Yeah, no,
it never goes away, girl.

844
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,433
Come on, proof.
This is me fat.

845
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,567
-Oh, queen.
-Oh, my God.

846
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,600
Girl, you look
completely different.

847
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,233
I was chubby too.

848
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:55,100
I was always aware it,
like, when I was kid, like,

849
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,367
'cause other kids
made it very apparent like,

850
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,800
"Mm, reminding you.

851
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,433
Not only are you super gay,
but you're also chubby."

852
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,467
<i>When I was an overweight kid,</i>

853
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,467
<i>being ridiculed</i>
<i>and made fun of,</i>

854
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,000
<i>I wanted to have that poise</i>

855
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,934
<i>and that confidence</i>
<i>and that power,</i>

856
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,300
and now finally with drag
I can do that.

857
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,266
That's how it was.

858
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:12,367
Like, when you're fat,
people just, like,

860
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:16,033
-Like a person?
-Yeah.

861
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,033
Like taking public transit,
people never sit next to you.

862
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,600
Really, you notice
things like that?

863
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,900
All the time.

864
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,066
<i>Because of those experiences,</i>

865

how to be confident in myself

866
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,900
and how to be comfortable
in my own skin,

867
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,266
<i>but just like all the other</i>
<i>things I'm doing here,</i>

868
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,333
<i>I want to commit to it</i>
<i>and become better.</i>

869
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,300
Did people start hitting on
you when you lost the weight?

870
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,367
I'm still a virgin, so no.

871
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,033
-What?
-What?

872
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:42,233
I was totally coming onto you
when I met you that one time.

873
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,367
Maybe people
are hitting on you

874
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,633
and you literally
have no clue.

875
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:45,367
Is that a possibility?

876
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,633
-Not really; I don't know.
-Yes, yes.

877
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:47,533
I think so.

878
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,500
Acid said she was
hitting on you and you--

879
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,066
I was, hard too.

880
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,400
I just thought
you were being friendly.

881
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm gagging.

882
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Hopefully someone
sees the beauty in me

883
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,800
one of these days.

888

-So, Cynthia.
-Uh-huh?

889
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,333
What was it
like in Puerto Rico?

890
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,333
Oh, amazing.

891
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,266
They got a lot of gangs
in Puerto Rico too.

892
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,066
Yes.

893
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,533
When I was
younger, girl,

894
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,934
I wanted to be in a gang.

895
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:22,900
Girl, I had a gun,
a .38 Special.

896
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,934
-What?
-Yes, God.

897
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:26,333
I was a little gangbanger.

898
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,100
Girl, I've seen people shot.

899
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,066
Oh, my God.

900
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:32,133
I've smelled, like,
the smell of brains.

901
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,367
Chi Chi, that is insane.

902
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,300
Girl, to see my mom
break down and cry?

903
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,533
That was it.

904
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,333
Plus my daddy beat the hell
out of me for having a gun.

905
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,300
-Good parenting.
-Yeah.

906
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,600
I can't even imagine.

907
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,633
When I tell you
I come from the streets,

908
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,066
I'm not kidding.

909
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,600
People don't make it
where I come from.

910
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,367
Were you doing
all of that

911
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,867
with gangs and everything
'cause you were trying

912
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,200
to hide the fact
that you were gay?

913
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,567
Yeah,
'cause I was afraid

914
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,233
of what my mom,
my brother, you know,

915
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,066
everybody would think of me.

<i>I can kind of see</i>

917
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,967
<i>why I was acting out.</i>

918
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,233
It was because
I wasn't being me.

<i>When I finally came out,</i>

920
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:13,200
it was a turning point
in my life.

921
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,166
I could have been dead.

922
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,066
I could have been locked up,

923
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,066
but I'm here with you girls.

924
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,633
I feel blessed,
bitch, to be here.

925
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,633
And you're a role model,
an example

926
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,433
for the future generations.

927
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,233
So, so proud of you, baby.

928
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,166
Baby, I overcame it.

929
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,066
-All right.
-Okay.

930
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,066
Can I get an amen?

931
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,300
-[all] Amen.

932

-What?

933
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,133
What does that mean?

934

1189
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,066
Chi Chi DeVayne.

1190
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:08,467
She is your dream girl.

1191
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,200
Oh, stop.

1192
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,934
Shine, Dina, shine.

1193
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:13,433
<i>I'm stomping it down.</i>

1194
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,266
<i>Walking around puddles</i>
<i>on the girls.</i>

1195
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:16,934
<i>For those who don't know</i>
<i>what that is,</i>

1196
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:19,233
<i>it's making</i>
<i>a figure eight on stage.</i>

1197
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:22,900
<i>Just serving up</i>
<i>this beautiful red dress.</i>

1198
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,367
<i>Oh, I'm gonna serve</i>
<i>these bitches up.</i>

1199
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:26,333
She got dreams of her own.

1200
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,633
Yes.

1201
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:29,300
That's the Louisiana glamour.

1202
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,066
Down in the bayou.

1203
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:34,066
"RuPaul's Drag Race"

presents Naomi Smalls.

1205
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:39,567
-Come on, baby.
-Ooh, yes.

1206
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:41,100
<i>I know that the judges</i>

1207
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,567

<i>from every angle.</i>

1208
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,133
<i>The hair is right.</i>
<i>The legs are right.</i>

1209
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,066
<i>The shoes are right.</i>
<i>The face is right.</i>

1210
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:48,266
<i>Everything's right.</i>

1211
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:50,300
<i>I just made</i>
<i>the best dressed list.</i>

1212
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,367
Serving legs,

00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,667
Acid Betty.

1215
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,667
Oh, architecture.

1216
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:05,233
She is giving 1970s
Pat Cleveland on the runway.

1217
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,867
-Yes.
-You know what, Ru?

1218
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,066
-Huh?
-She don't fool me.

1219
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,934
-I see right through her.
-[laughter]

1220

<i>I've chosen to wear</i>
<i>this skin color gown</i>

1221

<i>and, of course, my fierce</i>
<i>Philip Treacy wannabe hat.</i>

1222
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:20,367
<i>This outfit is couture</i>
<i>made just for me,</i>

1223
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,100
<i>and no other bitch</i>
<i>will have one.</i>

1224
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,166
Is that a new telephone?

1225
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,333
-Bluetooth.
-This is the 5G network.

1226

Southern belle.

Come on, Lonette McKee.
"Cotton Club."

1230
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,400
-Can I borrow a cup of flour?
-She's all out.

1231
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,066

1234
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:44,200
<i>I'm not a gown girl,</i>

1235
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,400

1236
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,667
<i>that I have clothes</i>
<i>that can touch the floor,</i>

1237
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,166
<i>and I want to show them</i>
<i>a different silhouette</i>

1238
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,066
<i>than I normally would wear.</i>

1239
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:54,433
Yes, bang, bang
into the room.

-She doing the neutron dance.
-Oh, yeah.

Thorgy Minnelli.

1243
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,533
<i>Whoo, it's disco, bitch.</i>

1244
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,934
<i>I decided to not wear</i>
<i>what everyone else is wearing,</i>

1245
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,133
<i>which was a boring gown.</i>

1246
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:08,333
<i>I'm wearing my big</i>
<i>Donna Summer hair</i>

1247
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,900
<i>and my sequin jumpsuit</i>
<i>that I made from scratch.</i>

1248
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,400
<i>I'm comfy,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>

1249

"Xanadu."

1250
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,266
I want to dance
with your somebody.

1251
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:20,133
She's the drag daughter
of a "Solid Gold" dancer.

1252
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,900
Welcome, ladies.

1253
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,066
Now, this week
you performed in teams,

1254
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:30,600
but tonight you'll be
judged as individuals.

1255
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,867
Harshly.

1256
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:36,467
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1257
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,467
Laila McQueen.

1258
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:41,333
Thorgy Thor.

1259
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,567
Kim Chi.

1260
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:45,900
Acid Betty.

Dax ExclamationPoint.

1262
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,066
Chi Chi DeVayne.

1263
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:54,900
Ladies,
you represent the tops

1264
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,166
and the bottoms
of the week,

1265
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:01,400
and the rest of you bitches
in the background...

1266
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:04,200
are safe.

1267
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,600
You may leave the stage.

1268
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,400
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1269
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,100
Ladies,
you represent the tops

1270
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
and the bottoms of the week.

1271
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,567
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques.

1272
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:24,333
First up,
Laila McQueen.

1273
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,066
Hello, Laila,
I think the dress is pretty.

1274
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:29,600
The problem is,
you're lost in it.

1275
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,367
The hair is flat and long.

1276
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:34,200
Everything's being pulled down.
You can see none of you.

1277
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,867
And as far as
the performance goes,

1278
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:39,166
I feel like I wasn't getting
much of the comedy,

1279
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:42,600
especially with the big
personalities around you.

1280
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,967
Up next, Kim Chi.

1281
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:48,066
I can tell
that you cannot dance,

1282
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:51,967
but on the positive side
of that, you chose a character

1283
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,533
to cover up
that you can't dance,

1284
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:54,867
and it worked.

1285
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,567
I don't mind
that you can't dance

1286
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:01,100
because this look
is, like, fantastic.

1287
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,133
-Yeah, I just want to smell you.
-Mmm.

1288
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:07,066
I do get concerned
about your walk.

1289
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:09,266
I'm not sure anymore
that it's a choice.

1290
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:11,233
It's very stiff, darling.

1291
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:12,333
Give yourself over to it.

1292
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,567
Allow yourself to have fun
on this runway.

1293
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,400
How do you say
"sissy that walk" in Korean?

1294
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,300
-[speaking Korean]
-[speaking Korean]

1295
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,433
-Pow, pow.
-Yes, yes, yes.

1296
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:21,633
[speaking Korean]

1297
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,667
Up next, Louisiana glamour.

1298
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,533
Bayou country.
Chi Chi DeVayne.

1299
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:29,066
-Hey, y'all.
-[laughs]

1300
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:30,633
It's funny 'cause
we shot "Pitch Perfect"

1301
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:33,467
in Baton Rouge,
so you make me feel really good

1302
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:34,500
by hearing your voice.

1303
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,934
Your performance today,
you turned it completely out.

1304
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:40,100
That got them ass clap.

1305
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,500
You know, they'd be
throwing some dollars

1306
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,834
at your ass real fast.

1307
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,667
You definitely are
my new trap queen.

1308
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,967
So tonight,
I think you look--

1309
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:52,367
for lack of a better term,
sort of basic.

1310
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,967
Look around.

1311
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:58,166
This is a crew that came
to play this season.

1312
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,066
But she looks amazing.
I love the red dress.

1313
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:02,867
"Dreamgirls"
is one of my favorite musicals,

1314
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:07,066
so right now you're giving me
Sheryl Lee Ralph realness.

1315
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:09,066
I don't really have anything
negative to say about you.

1316
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,166
Thank you.

1317
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:12,166
[laughter]

1318
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,967
Next up, Acid Betty.

1319
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,066
What I really loved
about what you did is,

1320
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,100
you were really a team player.

1321
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,400
You were concerned
about everybody else,

1322
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,567
and I appreciate stuff like that

1323
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,066
because it lets
me know you care.

1324
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:27,100
So I love the headpiece.

1325
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,066
I love the body art.

1326
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:32,133
I'm not getting the train.

1327
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:33,900
I just like looking
at you right now.

1328
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,467
I like looking
at you right now.

1329
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:37,600
-Ha-ha!
-Do you need this?

1330
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,100
You can't see
this right now,

1331
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,600
but he's got a fistful
of Jergens lotion.

1332
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,967
[laughter]

1333
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:45,967
The one thing I'm
concerned about with you is,

1334
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,400
you're setting the bar so high.

1335
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,967
I'll be waiting to see
if you can keep raising it

1336
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,500
'cause when you'll fall,
you'll fall hard.

1337
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,333
Is that a challenge,
Michelle?

1338
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,600
It's always a challenge when
I throw it out there, darling.

1339
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,066
Next up,
Dax ExclamationPoint.

1340
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:02,300
I love your face.
I love the hair.

1341
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,300
Something about the bottom
of the dress is not done.

1342
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,967
One thing I did notice
from last week.

1343
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:10,066
I have an issue
with your padding.

1344
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:12,100
It almost gives you
a quadru-butt.

1345
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,166
Just look at it.

1346
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,200
The performance,

1347
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,133
I really wanted you
to get that hood,

1348
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:19,934
like, uh, you know,
and it--and it still never came,

1349
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:20,967
and in rehearsals
you were saying,

1350
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,867
"Oh, yeah, I'll do it when
I figure out these steps."

1351
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:26,400
I am not a classically
trained dancer in the least,

1352
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,433
and like, I was also trying
to kind of create a character

1353
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,600
while also thinking too much
about other stuff, and like--

1354
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,200
You just got to go.

1355
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,533
Whether you do it wrong
or whatever, commit.

1356
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,133
All right,
Thorgy Thor.

1357
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:39,400
As far as
the dance portion,

1358
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,600
you're one of the people
I didn't have to worry about.

1359
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,533
What I love about
the jumpsuit is,

1360
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:46,333
it's smart because
you said, "You know what?

1361
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,567
"At a movie premiere,
everybody else

1362
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,433
"is gonna do
some glamorous gown.

1363
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:52,066
I'm gonna do something
that's representative of me,"

1364
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:55,433
But you wear your eyes so black
that I'm losing your eyeballs,

1365
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,133
so blend it out.

1366
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,567
I'll take that challenge, yes.

1367
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:01,000
Thank you, ladies.

1368
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Now, while you
untuck backstage,

1369
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,600
the judges
and I will deliberate.

1370
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,433
Now, just between us altos,
what do you think?

1371
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:12,200
<i>Laila McQueen.</i>

1372
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,633
She stood out to me because
she was the most improved.

1373
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:15,834
I would have never thought

1374
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,333
she could last through
the whole performance.

1375
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:20,233
But I didn't really
remember what she had done.

1376
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:21,400
The only thing
I remember about her

1377
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,567
is the mole
underneath her eye,

1378
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,633
so I don't think that's good.

1379
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:26,900
You know what this is?

1380
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,133
This season has
very strong personalities.

1381
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:31,033
She's out of her league.

1382
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:34,033
I know she has a fire in her,

1383
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,567
but she gonna have
to step her pussy up.

1384
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,233
-Oh.
-Kim Chi.

1385
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:40,233
Talk about somebody who's
the polar opposite of Laila.

1386
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:42,367
You can't stop
looking at Kim Chi.

1387
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:45,166
When I see her on the runway,
I was blown away,

1388
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:49,500
<i>but it's so weird to me</i>
<i>that she can't walk in heels.</i>

1389
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,900
It could become a trend.

1390
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,834
New York Fashion Week,
a sasquatch, a Godzilla.

1391
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,266
You better Kim Chi
that walk, girl.

1392
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,467
Yes.

1393
00:50:57,467 --> 00:51:00,867
But my fear for Kim Chi
is that she is a look.

1394
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:03,467
Because she's had such success

1395
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:05,300
with who she is visually,

1396
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,367
<i>she hasn't had</i>
<i>to deliver a performance.</i>

1397
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:11,867
She just had to be really cute
and kind of nerdy and anime-y,

1398
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:14,066
but I think there's
a personality in there.

1399
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,367
I just want her to unleash it
and let us have it.

1400
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,200
Chi Chi DeVayne.

1401
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,867
Tonight on the stage,
did she play it safe?

1402
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:23,100
-Yes.
-I loved her outfit.

1403
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,500
It just seemed
very classic and beautiful,

1404
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,200
and as far
as the performance goes,

1405
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,266
she really slayed
the other girls.

1406
00:51:30,266 --> 00:51:31,967
-I mean, really.
-Yes.

1407
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,367
She was doing
her neck ghetto style

1408
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:38,133
upside down while twerking
and not missing a word.

1409
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:39,533
Honey, I was ready to make
the Louisiana Purchase

1410
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:42,266
one more time.
[laughter]

1411
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,166
Acid Betty.

1412
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,233
Energy-wise,
a complete standout.

1413
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:48,100
I particularly loved
her runway look

1414
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,900
<i>with that weird</i>
<i>fiber optic spiderweb.</i>

1415
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,400
-Yes.
-Everything I love about drag.

1416
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,767
Look, it wasn't perfect.

1417
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:54,734
There was weirdness at the back

1418
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:56,467
that looked like draperies
being dry-cleaned.

1419
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,200
I would have liked
if that dress just

1420
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,967
did the see-through thing
all the way down

1421
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:03,300
because it made
her bottom heavy,

1422
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,400
and the color's ugly.

1423
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,367
-Sorry.
-Sorry 'bout it.

1424
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:08,567
Dax ExclamationPoint.

1425
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:11,934
Tonight on the runway,
it just was all wrong for me.

1426
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,567
The flower did not go
with the dress.

1427
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:14,967
The colors were dull,

1428
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:17,500
and in the performance
you literally forgot

1429
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,066
that Dax was there.

1430
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,066
In "Pitch Perfect,"
I know what it felt like

1431
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:23,066
to not be a classical dancer.

1432
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:25,400
It just takes courage
to get past it.

1433
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,967
She don't want to fight for it.

1434
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,600
It's like she's the girl
in the girl group

1435
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,066
with the Beyoncé in it.

1436
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:34,166
Beyoncé only stands out
because she really wants it.

1437
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,133
-She's the Farrah.
-LaTavia.

1438
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,066
I don't want
to call no names.

1439
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:41,133
Thorgy Thor.

1440
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,166
She nailed the performance.

1441
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,433
She came out in that catsuit.

1442
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,066
It was 180 degrees different

1443
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:48,900
from the performance
personality.

1444
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,166
-Just hated the shoes.
-Uh-huh.

1445
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,333
They look like ugly shoes.

1446
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,867
-Well, no,
-My issue is her makeup.

1447
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,967
Two times in a row
it's a--two black eyes.

1448
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,333
So, Michelle,
what you're saying is that

1449
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,266
Thorgy is in an abusive
relationship with her makeup.

1450
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,734
Yes.

1451
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:07,533
Silence.

1452
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:10,066
I've made my decision.

1453
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:12,367
Based on your
"Bitch Perfect" performance

1454
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,633
and your movie
premiere eleganza,

1455
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:17,567
I've made some decisions.

1456
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:22,934
Thorgy Thor, you're safe.

1457
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,100
Thank you.

1458
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:27,667
Chi Chi DeVayne,

1459
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,233
not only did
you turn it out,

1460
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:33,100
girl,
you turned it upside down.

1461
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,100
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

1462
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:35,934
-Wow.
-Wow.

1463
00:53:35,934 --> 00:53:39,233
-For real?
-Really, Ru?

1464
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,333
Chi Chi sucked as a leader.

1465
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,967
<i>I won a challenge.</i>

1466
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:46,200
<i>I'm definitely on the radar.</i>

1467
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,367
Y'all girls better look out.

1468
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:50,100
You've won
a four-night getaway

1469
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,367
to an all gay
bed and breakfast

1470
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:59,333
in beautiful New England
courtesy of MyGayGetaway.com.

1471
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,166
So I get to go overseas?

1472
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,567
No, New England is here
in the United States.

1473
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,834
-Oh, okay.
-[laughter]

1474
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:09,600
Chi Chi,
you may cross the seas

1475
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,066
-and join the other girls.
-Whoo!

1476
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:18,400
Acid Betty,
you're safe.

1477
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Thank you.

1478
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,567
Dax ExclamationPoint,

1479
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:25,600
the lack of commitment
to your performance

1480
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,367
forces me to put a question mark
after your name.

1481
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,400
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1482
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,433
<i>I think there were girls</i>
<i>that did worse than me,</i>

1483
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:39,300
and I'm sad,
and I'm just pissed about it.

1484
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,533
Laila McQueen,
in your performance

1485
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:46,533
you got lost
in the din and tonic.

1486
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:52,333
Kim Chi, in your performance
you put your left foot forward.

1487
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,967
Both of them.

1488
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:58,266
Laila McQueen,
I'm sorry, my dear,

1489
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:00,633
but you are
up for elimination.

1490
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:06,133
Kim Chi,
you are safe,

1491
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:08,200
and you may join
the other girls.

1492
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:13,533
Two queens stand before me.

1493
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,433
Prior to tonight
you were asked

1494
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:17,934
to prepare
a lip-sync performance

1495
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:21,367
of "I Will Survive"
by Gloria Gaynor.

1496
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:26,467
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me

1497
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:30,367
and save yourself
from elimination.

1498
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,967
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]

1499
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:38,433
For you to lip-synch
for your life.

1500

[echoes]

1501
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:42,834
<i>I don't really do disco.</i>

1502
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:45,133
<i>It's just not my genre,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty confident</i>

1503
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,633
I can definitely beat,
uh, Laila.

1504
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:50,066
Sorry, I forgot her name
for a second.

1505
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,066
<i>I feel the song</i>
<i>that we're doing</i>

1506
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:54,600
<i>has such strong emotion</i>
<i>tied with it,</i>

1507
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,166
and Dax is kind of lackluster,
and the song is not lackluster,

1508
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:00,166
<i>so I'm like,</i>
<i>"You got this."</i>

1509
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:09,867
All right, here we go.

1510
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:14,700
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

[applause]

Ladies,
I've made my decision.

1559
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:19,066
Dax ExclamationPoint,

1560
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:21,567
Laila McQueen...

1561
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,467
Neither one of you
survived that lip sync.

1562
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,233
I must ask you both
to sashay away.

1563
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:41,600
Wait, second time
in history of "RuPaul."

1564
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,567
Two eliminated!

1565
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,066
Thank you, ladies.

1566
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:47,066
You may leave the stage.

1567
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,266
Both of us?

1568
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:57,233
<i>We're glad</i>
<i>we made it here,</i>

1569
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,800
but it sucks to go home
second, third.

1570
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,166
That's about
accurate, yeah.

1571
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,500
<i>I know I gave it.</i>

1572
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,934
<i>I didn't half-ass it.</i>

1573
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,266
I just wish
it hadn't gone this way.

1574
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:10,467
I look forward
to a nap and vodka.

1575
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,967
Lots of vodka.

1576
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:19,467
Michelle,
may I borrow your phone?

1577
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:26,367

1579
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,967
Hi, it's RuPaul.

1580
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:32,066
Who the fuck
is RuPaul talking to?

1581
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:36,133
Listen, I had to eliminate
two queens today.

1582
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,467
How soon can you get here?

1583
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,500
Fuck.

1584
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,700
Someone's coming back.

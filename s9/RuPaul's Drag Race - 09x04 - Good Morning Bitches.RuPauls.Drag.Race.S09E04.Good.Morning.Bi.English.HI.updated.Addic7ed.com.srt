      as we're being real,

    should've been top three.

       a chap and a coat.

  praised for just being pretty

    I think that I'm amazing.

00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:43,639
             - Yeah!

131
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,707
         - Oh, and just         
         one more thing.

132
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,777
    Your show is going to be    
         broadcast live.

133
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,112
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines

134
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:56,014
   and may the best woman win.

135
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,483
       - #TeamNotOnToday.

136
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,818
   - Nina, do not let the fact

137
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,320
    that you were picked last   
          in your head

138
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,288
        because I'm glad        
    that you're on our team.

139
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,155
             - Okay.

140
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:07,955
      But at the same time,

141
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,957
        if you're, like,        
    saying that we love you,

142
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,558
          when we have          
        to choose groups,

143
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,559
   why would you run past me?

144
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,129
    I think the other queens    
   see me as a Debbie Downer,

145
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,497
            the girl            
      who gets in her head.

146
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,932
    But I can't just pretend    
        when I'm over it.

147
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:22,401
   I kind of wear my emotions   
          on my sleeve.

148
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:23,435
       - So Team Captain,

149
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:25,570
    is our television station   
        set in the South?

150
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,439
         - There's three        
      Southern Belles here.

151
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,442
   - But "Not On Today" I feel  
     like is kind of ghetto.

152
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,010
    Do you think we should do   
         ghetto accent?

153
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:33,543
            - No, no.

154
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:35,378
      - I think the biggest     
      challenge for Trinity

155
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,646
     is going to be keeping     
        everybody in line

156
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,482
        'cause she's got        
     some big personalities.

157
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:44,752
          Let's just--          
  She's got Eureka on the team.

158
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,755
            [laughs]            
  And it may be kind of tough.

159
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,324
         - Ghetto fierce        
       like, not on today.

160
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,460
     - This--okay, so first     
    of all, as Team Captain,

161
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,762
      I don't want anybody      
    to talk over each other.

162
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,096
       So raise your hand

163
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,997
       and let the person       
         that's talking

164
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,365
   finish what they're saying.

165
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,733
            - Ha-ha.

166
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,134
      Here it comes, girl.

167
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,469
            Step one            
     of competitive Trinity.

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,306
    - Also, I think we would    
   have really good chemistry

169
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,508
        so we're gonna be       
        the news anchors.

170
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,108
             - Okay.

171
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,977
     - Then, because you're     
 really good at building stuff,

172
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,645
       you're really gonna      
       be good at the DIY.

173
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:19,180
       And then, y'all are      
    definitely entertainment.

174
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:22,349
      - We don't talk about     
  who wants to play what role.

175
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,117
        Trinity is, like,       
     you're doing this role,

176
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,017
     you're doing this role.

177
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,253
 So, to me, it wasn't a leader, 
       it was a dictator.

178
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,655
       - When Ru was like       
         "Not On Today,"

179
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,557
        it did give that,       
      like, tinge of shade.

180
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,925
      - Okay, I'm so sorry.

181
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,126
         - God, please.

182
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,961
     This is typical Eureka.

183
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,063
  - You know, something shady.  
     - Maybe we each could--

184
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:41,731
           - Maybe not          
       towards each other.

185
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,865
          - This is me          
       holding my hand up

186
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,499
     and following the rules    
      that we set in place.

187
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,401
 If you're gonna set the rules, 
        follow the rules.

188
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,369
   - Eureka needs to shut up.

189
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,271
        I'm trying to be        
      a good Southern Belle

190
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,607
    and not punch this bitch    
          in the face.

191
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,876
      - So all three of us      
 just need to have our own vibe.

192
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,711
         You all need...

193
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,179
      - If y'all want to be     
       that ghetto--yeah.

194
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,415
      - We're over-talking      
      each other, remember?

195
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,082
           - [squawks]

196
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,116
         - What I think         
        we should do now

197
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,584
            is break            
      in our smaller groups

198
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,653
    and then we'll reconvene    
  after we go over everything.

199
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:11,587
          - Yes, Miss.

200
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,189
     - Eureka wants it to be    
        the Eureka Show,

201
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:16,291
    but that's not happening.

202
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:17,625
        Girl, no, ma'am.

         <i> - Coming up...</i>        
     - Live in three, two...

204
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:24,731
           - First up,          
     we have Raja and Raven.

205
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:25,798
         - Let's move on        
      to the next one--oh.

206
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,001
       - And next, we have      
       Coco Montrese and--

207
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:31,436
             - Next!

         [RuPaul laughs]

211
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,278
    - We're going to give you   
            the scoop

212
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,048
      about Justin Bieber's     
      shocking new sex tape

213
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,616
     with Dame Maggie Smith.

214
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:49,917
     The challenge this week

215
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,920
     is to cohost two rival     
       morning chat shows.

216
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,856
   With my experience working   
    with "Live," I'm excited.

217
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,524
     But also, I don't want     
        to be just known

218
00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:00,860
 as that guy that does Madonna, 
       Cher and Lady Gaga.

219
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:02,394
   I'd like to be known for me

220
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,496
    because there's only one    
   Charlie Hides in the world.

221
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:05,163
           Google it.

222
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,032
    - Trust me, you are going   
         to watch this.

223
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,367
         - You're going         
      to want to see this.

224
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,668
      - Okay. You're want--

225
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,703
          You're going          
     to wanted to see this.

226
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:14,970
        - You're going--        
        You are going...

227
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,138
    - Trust me. You are going   
      to want to see this.

228
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,509
     - Cynthia has sometimes    
      a haphazard approach.

229
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,178
        And with comedy,        
    if you add an extra word,

230
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,012
     you can blow the joke.

231
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,813
           If you drop          
       a couple of words,

232
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:27,713
     you can blow the joke.

233
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,315
    - Trust me, you are going   
      to want to see this.

234
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,716
      - And just say want.

235
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:32,316
             - Want.

236
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:33,483
     - You're going to want     
          to see this.

237
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:37,253
    - Okay. Trust me, you are   
   going to want to see this.

238
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,454
         - You're going         
      to want to see this.

239
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,455
    - Want to see this, okay.   
             - Yeah.

240
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,457
             - Okay.            
  - Yeah. But with a big smile.

241
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,492
    - Charlie's very strict.

242
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:46,228
    She's trying to correct,    
  like, all the pronunciation,

243
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,095
     and I appreciate that.

244
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,930
      But that's what made      
       my character funny,

245
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:52,400
   when I just pronounce words  
     that are mispronounced.

246
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:54,702
    I'm Cynthia Lee Martinez    
       Valles de la Flores

247
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:57,237
   filla de Orlando Fontaine.

248
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,538
    - But we call her Maria.

249
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,073
      - [chuckles] Charlie.

250
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:04,209
         - I wouldn't--         
   I don't know if I'd laugh.

251
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,443
         - Aye dios mio.

252
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,611
    - Trust me, the laughing    
    is going to be dead air.

253
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:10,447
     - Part of the challenge    
     is to show personality,

254
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,781
    like how to be yourself.

255
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:15,351
  And Charlie, in certain way,  
  is blocking me to be myself.

256

     - When I first started     
           on "Glee,"

358
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:19,576
         I didn't have,         
        like, any lines,

359
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:22,712
       so I would just sit      
  in the back of that classroom

360
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,280
     and, like, roll my neck

361
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:28,050
     and do anything I could    
    to get that camera on me.

362
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:28,850
         And it worked.

363
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,152
        - Congratulations       
        on your new book.

364
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:34,321

      is an amazing title.

365
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,155
    Where did that come from?

366
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,489
    - The book is all about,    
            you know,

   learning from your mistakes

368
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,124
         and being sorry        
        about some things

369
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,259
          and not sorry         
    about some other things.

370
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,960
           -Same here.          
             -Right?

371
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,430
     - So, Naya, what advice    
           do you have

00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,783
        -And we're clear.       
    -Best show on television.

         -<i> Coming up...</i>

384
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,852
         - I don't want         
        any extra breast

385
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:17,020
       other than--unless       
    they come with, uh, two--

386
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:21,057
    two biscuits--two breasts   
        and two biscuits.

387
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:24,025
         - I'm confused.        
     Peppermint's confused.

388
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,993
   We're all fucking confused.

   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

         [RuPaul laughs]

391
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,968
     - It's time for my team    
   "Not On Today" to go live.

392
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,173
          - Get ready!          
   Five, four, three, two, go!

393
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,376
         - Good morning.

394
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,478
    It's time for the biggest   
       stories of the day.

395
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,546
          - The Center          
     for Infectious Diseases

396
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,415
 has announced there's something
       in your makeup bag

397
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,184
    that could be killing you   
           right now.

398
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,852
  - I wonder what it could be?

399
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,954
 - I don't know, but whatever's 
       in your makeup bag,

400
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,889
    you should throw it away.

401
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,393
 - That's okay, because I'm sure
whatever I have in my makeup bag

402
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,794
    would certainly kill you.

403
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:11,064
     Uh, like your husband's    
         business card.

404
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,069
         - [fake laugh]

405
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,470

        and science news,

406
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,905
  all of Michelle Visage's fans 
       have come together

407
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,573
            to create           
     a crowdfunding campaign

408
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,008
         to pay for her         
    breast reduction surgery.

409
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,976
     You know, I don't want     
        any extra breast

410
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:29,578
       other than--unless       
    they come with, uh, two--

411
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,348
    two biscuits--two breasts   
        and two biscuits.

412
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,317
             Jesus.

413
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,319
            - Now for           
   the enter-taint-ment report

414
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:43,556
       with Charlie Hides       
    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

415
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:44,290
         - Good morning.

416
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,991
      Today, we're talking      
          social media.

417
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:48,426
  There's a fun new game people 
   are playing on the internet

418
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,694
     called #SophiesChoices.

419
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:51,628
    I give you two scenarios.

420
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,030
      You tell me which one     
    of the two you'd choose.

421
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,466
   You have to lick ice cream   
       off Nick Jonas' abs

422
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:00,735
        or eat fudge off        
    Chris Hemsworth's chest.

423
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,169
  - Let me tell you something.

424
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,837
     I'm intolerant lactose.

425
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,607
       I don't mind to go       
   all the way to the hospital

426
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,477
        just only to eat        
       that banana split.

427
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,711
           - [laughs]

428
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,645
          - Do you have         
       a question for me?

429
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:15,746
   -I got a question for you.   
             -Good.

430
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:19,116
    - You get one night with    
   Justin Bieber totally naked

431
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,718
        or one night with       
     Justin Bieber's money.

432
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,686
      - So I would probably     
       have sex with him,

433
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,522
      have a hidden camera,     
    send the pictures to TMZ

434
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,724
    and then keep the money.

435
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:29,958
   - I'm gonna keep the money

436
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,959
             because            
     I don't know if Justin

437
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:34,862
       had the opportunity      
      to deal with my cucu.

438
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,898
        It's time for...

439
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,734
    -Who Done Wore It Better.   
    -Who Done Wore It Better.

440
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:45,037
     - Detox, the drag queen    
     or Detox, the pussycat?

441
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,706
   - The cat looks incredible.

442
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,573
           - [laughs]

443
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,809
        - I'm looking at        
    Detox the pussycat's hair

444
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,876
    and it looks a little bit

445
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:56,646
       like Winifred from       
      "Hocus Post--Pocus"?

446
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:59,115
   - Charlie, what's going on?

447
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,383
   He is cold as a dead body.

448
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,818
   He's so tense, so nervous.

449
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,253
            - I think           
     we're gonna earn favor

450
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,288
         of our--one of         
    our favorite drag queens,

451
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,556
  Bob--uh, sorry, Thorgy Thor.

452
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:11,957
           Shantay...

453
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,358
           -You stay!           
           -You stay!

454
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,960
         - And finally--        
    well, that's about all--

455
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,330
    that's about all the time   
     we have for right now.

456
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,731
     - Don't touch the dial!

457
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,765
        - Don't touch me.

458
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,233
       - And we're clear.

459
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,601
        Commercial, guys.

460
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,540
           We're live           
       in three, two, go.

461
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,408
         - Welcome back.

462
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,409
    It's eight past the hour.

463
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,444
 - Eureka and Nina Bo-nina Brown
            are here

464
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,579
        to give us some--       
        give us some tips

465
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:41,282
  on how to do drag on a dime.

466
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,951
       - All right, Nina.       
   Now, this lace right here,

467
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:48,555
     it is 100% human hair,     
      but it costs $7,300.

468
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,490
      - Girl, what you need     
        to do is, honey,

469
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,492
   get your platinum EBT card,  
              girl.

470
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:52,992
             - Okay.

471
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,994
        - And go on down        
   to the Dollar Store, girl,

472
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:58,330
      and get you a lavish      
     ramen noodle wig, girl.

473
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,331
    - Oh. Is it beef flavor?

474
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,398
     - Ooh, chicken, bitch.

475
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,769
      Goes for a mere price     
            of $6.00.

476
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:08,038
       - Oh, it looks good      
     and tastes good, girl.

477
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,506
              -Hey.             
             -Okay.

478
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,240
       Now, let's move on.

479
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,842
         We've got these        
     ass cheek pads, honey.

480
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:15,144
      Gel. Per cheek, $200.

481
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,245
        - Girl, a cheek.

482
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:17,579
         You're doing it        
        all wrong, mama.

483
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,846
       Get this ham, girl.

484
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:22,115
       For the mere price       
        of $8.00, honey.

485
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,549
         - $8.00, bitch.

486
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,650
       - And stuff her up.

487
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,184
             Oh, oh!            
       - Well, all right.

488
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,086
     Oh, she's edible, too.     
    She look good and she...

489
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,287
       -Tastes good, girl.      
       -Tastes good, girl.

490
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,288
       - Great, and we're       
         in commercial.

491
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,790
         We're moving on        
   to the celebrity interview.

492
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:37,059
          - Me and Nina         
       fucking killed it.

493
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,293
         The ham's good.

494
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,328
    Can I have another piece?

495
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,099
       - We're coming back      
        in three, two...

496
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,101
        - Please welcome        
     our very special guest,

497
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:52,237
       actress and singer       
          Naya Rivera.

498
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,538
    Are you happy to be here?

499
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,939
      - Hi. "Not On Today."

500
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,440
           [all laugh]

501
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,876
    - Now, I heard somewhere    
     that when you were 19,

502
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:01,177
     you lied on your resume

503
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,078
          to get a job          
     at Abercrombie & Fitch?

504
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
           -I did. I--          
 -Did you fudge the truth at all

505
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,248
       to get onto "Glee"?

506
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,182
    - No. I had to actually--

507
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:09,850
      I had to sing and act     
          for that one.

508
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,452
 - What's the name of your book 
   and when is it coming out?

509
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,953
          - It's called         
        "Sorry Not Sorry:

510
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,621
        Dreams, Mistakes        
         and Growing Up"

511
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,889
        and it comes out        
         September 13th.

512
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:21,392
         - I'm thinking         
   that Trinity and Peppermint

513
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:25,629
      are not noticing that     
    it's time to wrap it up.

514
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,198
     - My publishers and I,     
 we just kind of really loved it

515
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,866
   and thought it was clever.

516
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:31,000
       - It's not my job.       
       I'm not the anchor,

517
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:33,302
but I'm just thinking Joy Behar,
       what would she do?

518
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,469
   - I can't wait to read it.

519
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:35,670
       - Thanks very much       
         for joining us.

520
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,705
            It's time           
      to go to commercial.

521
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:44,110
       - Do I get up now?

522
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,478
         - I'm confused.

523
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,612
     Peppermint's confused.

524
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,281
   We're all fucking confused.

525
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,285
         - Am I leaving?

526
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:56,852
             - Okay.

527
00:20:56,854 --> 00:21:00,121
       All right, ladies,       
       we're off the air,

528
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,856
    but nobody said goodbye.

529
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:05,959
    - This is definitely bad.   
         Bad, bad, bad.

530
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,760
    That's all I'm thinking,    
              bad.

531
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,194
         -<i> Coming up...</i>

532
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,262
  - You're making a really bad  
    first impression with me.

533
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,896
          - Why are you         
     talking over me, girl?

534
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,365
        - I can hear you        
        talking about me.

535
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,999
      - Because I'm upset.

536
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:20,335
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

537
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,704
         [RuPaul laughs]

538
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:27,707
     -Good morning bitches.     
     -Good morning bitches.

539
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:28,641
     - It's elimination day

540
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:33,078
      and our runway today      
      is naughty nighties.

541
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,447
   - How are you doing, girl?

542
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,649
           - I'm okay.          
  I just don't want to go home.

543
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:39,883
             -Right.            
        -Me and Valentina

544
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,918
      didn't have chemistry     
        in the challenge,

545
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,387
      and it makes me feel      
         really nervous

546
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,021
     because I just came off    
           the bottom.

547
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,890
  I think it's going to affect  
     how the judges see me.

548
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,625
      You know me, Alexis.      
             - Yeah.

549
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,026
           - You know           
      what I'm capable of.

550
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,161
     Like, it's not my 100%.

551
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:57,197
     - It's really hard when    
  you're in a pressure cooker.

552
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,932
       - But I don't feel       
    like I'm under pressure.

553
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:02,268
          I feel maybe          
       I'm overconfident.

554
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,936
    - Aja, I'm not gonna lie.

555
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,171
          You're, like,         
      oftentimes negative.

556
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,274
   You're making a really bad   
    first impression with me

557
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:12,844
     because I can hear you     
in the corners talking about me.

558
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:16,047
   Maybe some advice is that,   
    like, don't focus on me.

559
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:18,249
   Don't focus on other girls.

560
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,883
        Focus in on you.

561
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:21,817
       - I just feel like

562
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,886
 I've been such a disappointment
      while I've been here,

563
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:28,990
        and I took it out       
     in all the wrong ways.

564
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,324
         - All we can do        
         moving forward

565
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:33,026
         is to be kinder        
    to each other, you know?

566
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:33,726
        - Yeah, I agree.

567
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,095
       I really genuinely       
         like Valentina.

568
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,930
   I'm just really frustrated

569
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:40,866
        because I really        
        want this so bad,

570
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:42,267
         and I feel like        
         I'm fucked up.

571
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,535
  You're a really good person.  
        I'm really sorry.

572
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,503
           - I accept           
       your apology, babe.

573
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,037
       Just let me finish       
         doing my makeup

574
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,505
   'cause it's more important.

575
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,373
              -Aah!             
            -[laughs]

576
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,141
    - Tell me about the work    
         you were doing

577
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,008
      from HIV prevention.

578
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,409
  - I do referrals for clients

579
00:22:56,411 --> 00:23:00,112
         who--they were         
    newly diagnosed with HIV.

580
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,847
     - And it's so important    
        that people know.

581
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,150
   I'm of the era when people   
  would be spreading the virus

582
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,386
       before we even knew      
         it had a name.

583
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:12,923
     I came out just before     
       AIDS became known.

584
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,191
      So none of my friends     
       were playing safe.

585
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,828
  I buried all my best friends, 
    most of my best friends,

586
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,767
      and...that's probably     
       the hardest thing.

587
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,302
            Sometimes           
    I have survivor's guilt.

588
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,536
     Like why did I survive?

589
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:29,503
    It was a death sentence.

590
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:32,239
    I've seen so many smart,    
   beautiful, talented people

591
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,075
   go the route of the pills,   
       drugs, the bottle.

592
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,877
    Society was telling them    
    they are not good enough.

593
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,012
         The one message        
       I try to get across

594
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,547
   is you're worth it, you're   
   special, you're beautiful.

595
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,916
        And you're worth        
    taking care of yourself.

596
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,118
            [sobbing]           
    So you gotta stay strong,

597
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,287
       and you gotta rely       
        on your friends.

598
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,857
     - Thank you for sharing    
           that story.

599
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,126
   Because of your generation,  
   we appreciate what we have.

600
00:23:58,128 --> 00:23:59,393
        - It's important        
          to not forget

601
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,696
          what happened         
  in the eighties and nineties

602
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,097
     during the AIDS crisis

603
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,499
          and how many          
        brilliant voices

604
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,534
  in the world of art and drag

605
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:11,136
          we could have         
      without those losses.

606
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:14,506
   - My makeup is going to be   
  fucking ruined on the runway.

607
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:15,840
     - Do a smoky eye, girl.

608
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:17,408
           - [laughs]

609
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,877
     - Does anyone here have    
      psoriasis or just me?

610
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,411
       - I have bad acne.

611
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,312
   - I have really bad breath   
         in the morning.

612
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:24,779
             - Eew.

613
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:27,581
   - Can I tell you guys about  
one of the disorders that I have

614
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,516
    that I'm struggling with?

615
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:30,917
            - Eating.

616
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,319
    - Don't joke about that.

617
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,487
             Eureka,            
    it's really inappropriate

618
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,021
       to joke about that.      
    - Sasha, okay, I realize,

619
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,223
         but why push it        
     straight to negativity?

620
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:41,191
- I don't think she's pushing it
     straight to negativity.

621
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:45,328
  I think that she's trying to  
   keep the levels respectful.

622
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,064
     - By trying to make me     
     look like a bad person?

623
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,765
        - I have nothing        
          against you,

624
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,900
    but I have a long history   
     with eating disorders.

625
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:52,967
       You don't know now       
       by looking at me--

626
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,535
   - There are other types of   
   eating disorders besides--

627
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,669
       - But so many times      
          in my life--

628
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,038
       Why are you talking      
         over me, girl?

629
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,406
      - Because I'm upset.

630
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:02,108
     I make the joke to try     
     to make the air light.

631
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,342
         I'm not trying         
         to be malicious

632
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,877
     and I'm all of a sudden    
       not a good person.

633
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,645

   - I love the look tonight.

764
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,231
          I was worried         
    you were gonna fall over.

765
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,166
   Those are some high heels.

766
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,200
      -They are very high.      
           -Very high.

767
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,869
      - But what I noticed      
     about your performance

768
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,904
         is that you are        
        a control freak.

769
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,073
       You were so married      
         to those cards.

770
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,340
   Cynthia didn't even finish   
            her line

771
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:48,342
     and you already, like,     
        look, look, look.

772
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:50,577
        And when you were       
       interviewing Naya,

773
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,413
      when you ask somebody     
           a question,

774
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,947
            you need            
     to let them answer it.

775
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,549
     - It felt like you were    
      stepping on her lines

776
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:01,252
     and the timing was off.

777
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:04,722
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

778
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,423
   - To me, this does not read  
           as nightie,

779
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:09,025
   but what I loved about you   
        in the challenge

780
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,126
   was that even when Charlie

781
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:13,062
    was trying to direct you    
     in her controlling way,

782
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,532
         you were funny         
  and you messed the words up.

783
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:17,966
            You were            
    intolerant lactose and...

784
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:20,068
            -[laughs]           
        -You are a star.

785
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,537
   I really think that you've,  
    like, come into your own.

786
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,604
        Really well done.

787
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,105
          - Thank you.

788
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:25,705
            - Eureka.

789
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:27,373
   - Again, this doesn't read   
         nightie to me.

790
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,941
     This reads dominatrix.

791
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,543
   It's so funny how this end   
        is really nightie

792
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,511
  and that end is just whores.  
           - [laughs]

793
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:36,180
   - Well, surprise, surprise,  
    I disagree with Michelle.

794
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,881
  You're clearly going to bed.

795
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:38,982
        You're just doing       
        different things

796
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,083
   on that side of the runway.

797
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:41,784
            - You two           
   were my favorite to watch.

798
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:43,719
   Chemistry is not something   
          you can buy.

799
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,854
       That's why this one      
      has me around still.

800
00:31:45,856 --> 00:31:46,421
           - [laughs]

801
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:51,559
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown 
         Rodham Clinton.

802
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:53,160
           [all laugh]

803
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,129
          - [sniffling]

804
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:59,832
   I'm gonna probably be like   
   the cry baby of the season.

805
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,404
        -It's okay, mama.       
           -I'm sorry.

806
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,739
      I'm just so grateful      
           to be here.

807
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:09,140
        [sobs] I'm happy.

808
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:12,009
          - Well, Nina,         
   if those are tears of joy,

809
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,711
       I'd hate to see you      
       when you're upset.

810
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,913
           [all laugh]

811
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:17,880
       We love you, girl.

812
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:19,248
   Let's go to the critiques.

813
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,316
   - Again, it doesn't scream   
         nightie to me.

814
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,318
           It screams           
      streetwalking whore.

815
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,119
         And I love it!

816
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,653
       - In the talk show,

817
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,856
       you were serving me      
   the Lady Chablis realness.

818
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:30,857
    The painted on spit curl

819
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,391
          was just like         
       the cherry on top.

820
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,359
     - But you're gonna need    
         a thicker skin

821
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,727
         to get through         
        this competition.

822
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:39,664
         I so appreciate        
     what this means to you.

823
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,799
   I just want you to be ready

824
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,134
          for how tough         
       this is gonna get.

825
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,171
    - You all worked so hard    
       on this challenge,

826
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:50,573
        but I have to ask       
          one question.

827
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:55,945
     Who deserves to go home    
        tonight and why?

828
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:57,312
         Trinity Taylor.

829
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,580
   - Just from your critique,   
      it would be Charlie.

830
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,281
          - Peppermint,         
         same question.

831
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,716
    - Based on the critiques,   
            Charlie.

832
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:04,817
        - Charlie Hides.

833
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:09,288
  - Peppermint's look is a bit  
   more basic, so Peppermint.

834
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,555
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

835
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:14,825
    - Because I believe she's   
   a strong competition for me

836
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,395
       and her total look,      
           Peppermint.

837
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,663
      - All right, Eureka,      
           you're up.

838
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,463
     - I would say Trinity.

839
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,832
           I feel like          
       the ending wrap-up

840
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,201
         might have been        
    a little more controlled

841
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,035
    if we worked as a group.

842
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:30,538
      And I also felt like      
   she was focused on herself

843
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,607
     and not really so much     
        of everyone else.

844
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:34,574
         - I call shade.

845
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:37,543
    I take responsibility for   
   the things that I did wrong

846
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:40,746
    and if that's the reason    
      why I should go home,

847
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:41,513
       then I understand.

848
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:44,449
     But don't tell me that     
 I didn't do my job as a leader,

849
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:45,116
         because I did.

850
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:48,419
    And I included everybody,   
     including you, Eureka.

851
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,687
       - Well, I was asked      
       my honest opinion,

852
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,690
  and that's my honest opinion  
     and I stand beside it.

853
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:56,025
       - All right. Nina.

854
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:57,693
       - Trinity, because       
      she was the captain.

855
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:58,560
      But she did her job.

856
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:02,030
 It's just that we didn't really
  feel a part of it sometimes.

857
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,732
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   Thank you for your honesty.

858
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,900
   While you untuck backstage,

859
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,768
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

860
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,302
       [car engine starts]      
           All right.

861
00:34:11,304 --> 00:34:14,605
 Well, just between us squirrel 
   friends, what do you think?

862
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,740
         Let's start off        
      with Trinity Taylor.

863
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:19,442
  - Her morning talk show host, 
      I just didn't get it.

864
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:21,143
        - I think Trinity       
        really tripped up

865
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,178
          with that gag         
         they were doing

866
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,682
   because it didn't allow her  
    to be her charming self.

867
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,650
           Peppermint.          
       - My first thought

868
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,085
            was that            
   it seemed like a rehearsal.

869
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,887
   - For me, it was more about  
       her outfit tonight.

870
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,790
     - The black lace shirt     
  with a pink wrinkled nightie,

871
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,291
    it just was a whole bunch   
           of a mess.

872
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:45,329
    But I liked her better of   
 the two in the anchor position.

873
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:46,229
        - Charlie Hides.

874
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,563
           - The walk           
     on the runway tonight,

875
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,731
   she seemed tired or bored.

876
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:50,531
    She just wasn't shining.

877
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,566
   - She was my least favorite  
        in the challenge.

878
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,002
   - My notes next to her name  
    say dead behind the eyes.

879
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,737
            Gave up.            
           - [laughs]

880
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:01,407
     - I'm just disappointed    
  that a seasoned vet like that

881
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:03,075
       doesn't understand       
          how TV works.

882
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,342
        She didn't allow        
      the moment to happen.

883
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:09,013
   In fact, it almost impeded   
  on Cynthia Lee's performance.

884
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,614
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

885
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:11,781
  - She was so fierce tonight.

886
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:15,851
   She was giving, like, X-Men  
   weird angel/devil realness.

887
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:17,519
       - In her challenge,      
      she was so much fun.

888
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,686
           I couldn't           
       stop watching her.

889
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:22,456
  Dare I say that we are crazy

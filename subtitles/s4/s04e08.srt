00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,233
- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,734
You'll be launching
your very own dragazine.

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:08,967
- Sex sells, people, sex sells.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:09,934
- Ha ha.

5
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,433
I'm a successful drag queen.

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,333
I'm not like some club queen

7
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,133
who has to show for a dollar.

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,633
- You have to spot me.

9
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:17,800
- That looks like a man.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,033
I look like Sharon in that one.

11
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,000
- Ouch.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,100
- Your dragazine cover

13
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,266
is possibly the worst one.

14
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,500
I hate the font.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,533
- Me too.

16
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:27,900
- The eyes scare me.

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,300
- They're my trademark.

18
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,066
- It creeps me out.

19
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,934
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you are the winner

20
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,400
of this week's challenge.

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,200
- [laughs]

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,233
Ah, finally!

23
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:41,200
- Willam, shante, you stay.

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,367
Jiggly Caliente--
may I call you Jiggly?

25
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:45,800
- Yes.

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,700
- Sashay away.

27
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,066
And tonight, you'll be competing

28
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,467
as a couple...
of frenemies.

29
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:56,500
The jig is up.

30
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,767
If Phi Phi O'Hara was the last

31
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,266
ladyboy on earth,

32
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,734
would you kai kai with her?

33
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:05,066
And a shocking twist...

34
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,266
- [vomiting]

35
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,467
- It's really not cute.

36
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,467
- With extra-special
guest judges

37
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:14,600
Pamela Anderson
and Jennifer Tilly.

38
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,767
[cheers and applause]

39
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,300
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

40
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,133
will receive a lifetime supply

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,834
Walking in today
to Jiggly being gone

52
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,667
is obviously mind-boggling,

53
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,400
'cause there's only
six people left.

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
- [singing]

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,633
- Yo, that's a lot of lipstick.

56
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,133
- "To my bitches, love you all
to death, Jiggly Caliente."

57
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,800
At least the lipstick's
on the mirror

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,333
and not on her teeth for once.

59
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,834
Bye, girl, bye.

60
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,200
That was my first time
in the bottom two.

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
I wasn't happy to be up there,

62
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
and I know I was trying
to be pretty at least.

63
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
- Did it humble you?

64
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,600
- It didn't add
any humility to me.

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,066
- Humble pie is what
Willam should be.

66
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,967
If it was anybody else
other than Jiggly,

67
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,133
she would have went home
last night.

68
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,367
- Girl, you were so pissy
and fussy up there, girl.

69
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,367
Ooh!

70
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,200
- Any way to keep
my dress moving

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,734
and to keep me
sparkling a little bit.

72
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,767
- Mew mew doesn't make
talent, honey.

73
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,300
- My last performance
wasn't my best,

74
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
but it was enough
to keep me here.

75
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,934
- You girls told me to take
those damn white contacts

76
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:01,066
out of my eyes before Runway,
and I didn't.

77
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,200
I said I wanted 'em.

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,567
They looked pretty.

79
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,066
And they totally got me.

80
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,667
So now I have to, like, serve up
some girly-girl nonsense.

81
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,834
- Like, can you leave your
gothic and your vampire,

82
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,200
like, that type of look aside,
and just do, like,

83
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,367
glamorous, pretty?

84
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,066
- But I think I am glamorous.

85
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,567
Can I do a lemming look?

86
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,400
Sure, I can throw myself
off of a cliff with you,

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,667
but I don't want to.

88
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,066
I am no longer justifying

89
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,066
my personal beauty
to these girls.

90
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:30,533
No one remembers the girl with
the tan skin and the blond hair.

91
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:34,100
They remember the girl coughing
up blood with white eyes.

92
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,934
- What I read in my makeup
and everything,

93
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,767
I want the judges to know
that I am listening

94
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,500
and I want to be here--
- You did a great job.

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,166
- And I want to take
all their critiques in.

96
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,800
- Like, standing next to you
when you won,

97
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
you, like, kind of
threw your head back

98
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,934
and I saw, like,
the square sideburn.

99
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,066
- Oh, picking straws, dude.

100
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,633
- Hold on, I'm still
complimenting you

101
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,533
in your appearance
that was like--

102
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,700
- That's, like,
a backhanded compliment.

103
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm tired of her
and I want her to go home.

104
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,567
I thought it looked gorgeous,

105
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,400
and if I can rock a sideburns
and win a challenge,

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,533
then I'm gonna rock a sideburn
and win a challenge.

107
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,567
They liked it.

108
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,834
- Everybody want Willam
to go home.

109
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:09,133
She is completely annoying.

110
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,767
- Well, congratulations, whore.

111
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,166
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi.

112
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,133
- Two challenges ago,
I was in the bottom three,

113
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,100
and now I'm in the top.

114
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,433
- So, Phi Phi,
what took you so long?

115
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,467
[alarm wails]

116
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,567
- Ooh!

117
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,066
- Girl, you've got shemail.

118
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:27,166
<i>You know, there are two things</i>
<i>I don't like about you.</i>

119
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,233
<i>What?</i>
<i>Your face.</i>

120
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,667
<i>[gasps]</i>

121
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,367
<i>Ladies, keep your friends close</i>

122
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,567
<i>and you frenemies even closer,</i>

123
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,934
<i>'cause in this competition,</i>
<i>even the mirror has two faces.</i>

124
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,600
<i>Yeah, and one of 'em is</i>
<i>cracked.</i>

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,867
<i>Shut up!</i>

126
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,066
<i>Oh, you shut up!</i>

127
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>I'm not listening to you.</i>

128
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,867
<i>La la la la la la la.</i>

129
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:49,166
<i>Bitch, I'll be waiting for</i>
<i>your ass in the parking lot.</i>

130
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,300
<i>Bitch.</i>

131
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,166
[laughter]

132
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,467
Hello, hello, hello.

133
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,400
- Hi, Ru!
- RuPaul!

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,300
- Ladies, in a competition,

135
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,834
people can say one thing
to your face

136
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:03,333
and then talk smack
behind your back.

137
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,633
Sometimes it's hard to know

138
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,433
who your real friends are.

139
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,300
For today's mini challenge,

140
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,633
I'm not looking
for a winner or a loser.

141
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:12,934
I'm looking for the truth,

142
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:16,934
and you can't handle
the truth, girl.

143
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,900
One by one,

144
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,700
you'll be hooked
to a lie detector,

145
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,333
a little lady go by the name
of "Polly Graph."

146
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,467
Know her?

147
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,367
I thought you did.

148
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,333
- I'm worried she's gonna ask me
some questions

149
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,767
I don't want to answer.

150
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,667
- Time to spill it, girls.

151
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,867
[laughter]

152
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,233
Welcome, darling.

153
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,467
Now, I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

154
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:50,367
You answer each
with a simple yes or a no.

155
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,367
Is that clear?

156
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,600
- Yes.

157
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,533
- John, are you all set?

158
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,800
- I am.

159
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,066
- Are you now
or have you ever been

160
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,133
a biological woman?

161
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,800
- No.

162
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,900
- Have you ever worn
women's clothing?

163
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,834
- Yes.

164
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,066
- Do you sleep in the nude?

165
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,834
- No.

166
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,633
- Just as I suspected.

167
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:20,066
- If Sharon Needles were
the last ladyboy on earth,

168
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,533
would you kai kai with her?

169
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,200
- No.

170
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,400
- If Phi Phi O'Hara was
the last ladyboy on earth,

171
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,533
would you kai kai with her?

172
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,066
- Yes.

173
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:35,800
- If Willam were the last
ladyboy on earth,

174
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,233
would you kai kai with her?

175
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,533
- No.

176
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,533
- If Latrice were the last
ladyboy on earth,

177
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,133
would you kai kai with her?

178
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,233
- Yes.

179
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,467
- Yes.
- Yes.

180
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,600
- Interesting.

181
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,467
[beeping]

182
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,400
Do you think Willam
is prettier than you?

183
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,433
- Yes.

184
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,166
- No.

185
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,633
- No.

186
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,300
- Have you ever talked shade

187
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
behind Chad Michaels' back?

188
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,934
- No.

189
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:08,166
- Do you think you could win
a lip-sync for your life

190
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,066
against Sharon Needles?

191
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,433
- Yes.

192
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,433
- Have you ever lied
about your age?

193
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,467
- Yes.

194
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,433
- Fascinating.

195
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,066
- Do you think Willam
is annoying?

196
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,500
- Yes.

197
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,333
- Have you ever
looked at the pit crew

198
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,700
with lust in your heart?

199
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,100
- No.
- No.

200
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,800
- Yes.

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,333
- Do you like my line
of iron fist shoes?

202
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,767
- Yes.
- Yes.

203
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,500
- Yes.

204
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,333
- Last question:

205
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,333
Are you the future of drag?

206
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,467
- Yes.

207
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,533
- Yes.

208
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,834
- Yes.

209
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,900
- Your questioning is over.

210
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,233
I will supply the FBI with
a copy of your transcripts.

211
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,867
Ladies, the results are in.

212
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,967
In addition to the truth,
your answers revealed to me

213
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,967
a lot about your different
personality types.

214
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,767
Now, I've arranged you
in two lines.

215
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:10,834
Look at the queen directly
across from you.

216
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:15,266
That's the person you have
the least in common with,

217
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:18,133
someone you might not even
like very much,

218
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:22,800
but that queen possesses skills
and traits you don't have,

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,433
and in a crisis,
she could save your ass.

220
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,967
That means, Dida Ritz, you're
paired with Chad Michaels.

221
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,166
Willam, you're paired
with Latrice Royale.

222
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,467
- Oh, evil.

223
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:39,066
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you're paired
with Sharon Needles.

224
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:42,066
- Party City.

225
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,400
- Busted showgirl.

226
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,834
- For this week's
main challenge,

227
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,800
you need to put together
a nightclub act

228
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,433
sponsored by NYX cosmetics,

229
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,867
and you'll be competing
as a couple...

230
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,800
of frenemies.

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,367
Now, each pair will create
costumes, choreography,

232
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,800
and specialty lyrics
to the original song,

233
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,633
<i>Better Than You.</i>

234
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:07,333
Oh, and tomorrow
on the main stage,

235
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,800
you'll be singing it live...

236
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,100
- What?
[laughs] What?

237
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,633
- No lip-syncing.

238
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,567
- I don't sing live, boo-boo.

239
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,633
There's a reason
why I lip-sync.

240
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,667
- In the tradition
of famous frenemies

241
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,333
like Joan Crawford
and Bette Davis.

242
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,834
Time to make nice,
girls, or just fake it,

243
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,567
you know,
like I'm always doing.

244
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,633
[laughter]

245
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,400
Gentlemen, start your engines,

246
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,166
and may the best woman win.

247
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,133
See ya.

248
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,467
[laughs]
- Bye, Ru.

249
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,066
- Bye.
- O-m-g.

250
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,567
- Have you listened to it yet?
- No.

251
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,100
- It seems like the mindset
amongst the queens is that

252
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,934
you're only as good
as your last performance,

253
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,533
but I'm a singer,
I have a band,

254
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,667
and I plan to win
this challenge,

255
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,100
and I want to prove that I'm
not just some lip-syncing queen.

256
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
I think it's kind of
natural too,

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
because my voice is probably
an octave higher

258
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,066
than yours,
so it'll sound good.

259
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,567

00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay.

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,633
- Why don't we do,
like, the elphaba--

265
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,900
like, a<i> Wicked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>

266
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,867
- Ooh, I like devil and angel.

267
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:24,500
It's better,
and it's how people see us.

268
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
- I'm not sure how Phi Phi and
Sharon are gonna work together.

269
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,200
They're the most opposite,

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,100
and they've also had
a little tiff.

271
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,633
Should we rewind that back?

272
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,300
- Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck you.

273
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,467
- "Tired-ass showgirl"?
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!

274
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:40,166
Go back to Party City,
where you belong!

275
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,967
- If the chemistry's not there,
then it shows through on stage.

276
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,233
- Okay.

277
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,200
- We can play off that
showgirl/Party City thing.

278
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,867
- We can just write
Party City/busted showgirl,

279
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,000
as who you are.

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
[laughs]
Busted showgirl,

281
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,834
which I'm sure you don't want
to say about yourself.

282
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,000
- The only thing I'm really
nervous about

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,700
on this challenge is,
I can't stand Sharon,

284
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,200
and that probably won't change.

285
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
- Do you want to call me
post-mortem glam

286
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,667
or Party City spook?

287
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,400
- I think
Party City spook is good,

288
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,900
'cause I don't want
to call you glamorous.

289
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,734
- I wouldn't consider
Phi Phi a frenemy.

290
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,767
I'd consider her an enemy.

291
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,800
- And that's it.

292
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,433
<i>♪ I wear heels ♪</i>

293
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,100

299

Shit.

300
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,734
- This challenge is so tough

301
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,800
because we basically have
to create a nightclub act,

302
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,567
and we're singing it live.

303
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,100
<i>♪ I do it so much better ♪</i>

304
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,266
<i>- ♪ I do it so much ♪</i>

00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,100
<i>- ♪ I do it so much ♪</i>

306
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,800
- Neither Dida nor myself sing,
and it was hard.

307
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,166
both:<i> ♪ I do ♪</i>

308
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,233
- We sound like two sick cats.

309
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,967
both:<i> ♪ I do it</i>
<i>so much better than you ♪</i>

310
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,600
- I've been waiting
for this challenge,

311
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,967
because I love to sing, I've
been singing since I was little,

312
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,100
so we'll see how this goes.

313
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,333
<i>- ♪ I do it so much better ♪</i>

314
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,667
<i>♪ But I do it</i>
<i>so much better ♪</i>

315
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,300
- Hot mess.

316
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,967
Oh, my God. What?

317
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,567
both:<i> ♪ So much better</i>
<i>than you ♪</i>

318
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,700
- Hello, hello, hello.

319
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,100
- Hello.
- Hi.

320
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,066
- Hi, Ru.
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz.

321
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,200
So what's your plan?

322
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,433
- Well, our plan
is a classic sister act,

323
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,633
truly reading each other down
the Runway.

324
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,333
- Listen, there are
two other teams,

325
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,567
and you've got to have something
that's gonna stand out.

326
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,867
Dida, what do you think that
Chad has that you don't have?

327
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,700
- I have a bit more
of a kind of younger,

328
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,266
around the way
type of look with my drag.

329
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,800
- Chad, what about you?

330
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,967
What do you think that Dida has
that you don't?

331
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,233
- She's not afraid to,
you know,

332
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,967
fall on her face or to fail.

333
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,867
- I want to be surprised.
I want to be entertained.

334
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,066
Trust me,
they're coming for you.

335
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,433
- Thanks, RuPaul.
- All right.

336
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,567
- Thank you.

337
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,934
- Sharon Needles,
Phi Phi O'Hara, how's it going?

338
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,867
- I've been working
with my frenemy.

339
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,066
I guess it's going okay.

340
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,266
- Why do you think you two
were paired up?

341
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,600
- We kind of hate each other.

342
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,066
- Really?

343
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,266
A lot of co-stars don't
particularly like each other,

344
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:15,233
but somehow it creates
a sort of chemistry on-screen

345
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,266
that actually works.

346
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,233
Are either of you singers?
- I am.

347
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,066
- Yeah, we both
are kind of singers.

348
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,667
- Wow. All right, so do
a little preview act for me.

349
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,567
Okay. Ready?

350
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,900
- All right, so,
you want to do--

351
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,967
do you want to put our
choreography with it as well?

352
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,100
- Let's sing it right now.

353
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,533
- Okay, okay,
we'll just sing it,

354
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,633
'cause choreography,
we're working on real hard.

355
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,367
- Okay.
- I'm white, girl.

356
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,667
- Oh, dear.
- Ready? Here we go.

357
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,767

There's a lot of stuff
going on there.

368
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,934
- Sharon really wants to do
this, like, heavy metal voice,

369
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,900
and I'm like,
oh, hell no.

370
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,433
- I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

371
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,433
- Okay, thank you.
- Good, can't wait to show you.

372
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,900
I know I'm gonna do a good job.

373
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,233
Sharon better not fuck it up,
'cause I'm gonna be pissed.

374
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,367
- Willam and Latrice.
- Hello.

375
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,900
- Do either of you sing
in your acts?

376
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,066
- I regularly do.

377
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,834
Most of my act
is with a live band.

378
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,600
- Now, Latrice,
what do you think Willam has

379
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,066
that you don't have?

380
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,567
- When I first met
little Willam,

381
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,533
I was not featuring
her at all, right?

382
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,066
She was not the feature
presentation.

383
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:27,734
But I'm a quiet confident, where
she's very vocal about it.

384
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,934
- What does Latrice have
that you don't have?

385
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,233
- I would love to have
some of that quiet confidence

386
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,333
instead of my confidence
that some people mistake

387
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,633
for cockiness.

388
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:39,066
- I'm gonna help ground
Willam a little bit more.

389
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,133
We're gonna calm her down.

390
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,734
Pss-pss, pss-pss.
- Yeah.

391
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:44,533
- Let your work
speak for itself.

392
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,133
- So what is the gimmick
for your outfits?

393
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,233
- We're gonna be pretty in pink.
[laughs]

394
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,900
- Oh, pretty in pink.
Is that enough of a gimmick?

395
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,467
- Oh, I'm gonna turn her out.
- Oh, yeah?

396
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,066
- Basically,
she's gonna be a whore.

397
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,567
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.

398
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

399
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,100
- Okeydoke.
- All right, wonderful.

400
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,367
- Fuck it, let's just do what
we want to do and do it well.

401
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,934
- [groans]

402
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,767
- All right, ladies,
gather around.

403
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:10,867
Later today, you'll have
a chance to work on your acts

404
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,967
with the composer
of<i> Better Than You,</i>

405
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:16,934
my songwriting partner
and producer Lucian Piane.

406
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:18,066
- Very cool.

407
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,900
- And tomorrow
on the main stage,

408
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,867
you'll be making your
NYX cosmetics nightclub debut

409
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,166
in front of our
extra-special guest judges,

410
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,066
the wonderful actress and
poker champion Jennifer Tilly.

411
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,567
- [gasps]
- Wow!

412
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,300
- I love Jennifer Tilly!

413
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,800
- Academy award nominee
Jennifer Tilly.

414
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
It doesn't get better than that.

415
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,066
- And the always fabulous

416
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,333
Pamela Anderson will be here.

417
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,367
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

418
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:46,700
[laughter]

419
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,500
- Honey, I grew up watching
Pamela Anderson.

420
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,734
She's sickening.
She's the blond bombshell.

421
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:55,467
- And you'll be judged
as a team.

422
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:58,066
That means one pair
will be the winner

423
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,066
and one pair will have
to lip-sync for their lives.

424
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,233
- Why?

425
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,233
RuPaul, why are you
doing this to us?

426
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,967
- All right, frenemies.

427
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,533
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

428
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,934
- Thanks, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.

429
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,934
- Bye, Ru.
- This is crazy.

430
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,900
The first time in history
we all have to lip-sync

431
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,066
against each other.

432
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,767
Like, that could be
an emotional lip-sync.

433
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,533
What do you guys think
about, like,

434
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,700
having to lip-sync against
your teammate?

435
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,800
- Uh, well, that's a wrench
in the program, but--

436
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
- I'm not making plans to do it.

437
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,433
- [laughs]

438
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,400
- If Willam and Latrice
get in the bottom together,

439
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,567
bye, Willam.

440
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,300
- Honey, 'cause Latrice
know how to buck.

441
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,467
- Girl, Latrice
is gonna wear her out.

442
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,800
- Phi Phi's rolling her eyes
and talking about me,

443
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,066
and everybody's
saying I suck,

444
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,800
but they can fuck themselves.

445
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,066
I mean, Phi Phi--
I feel like in her eyes

446
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,066
I'm only as good
as my last performance,

447
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,166
and she thinks I'm just,
like, worthless now.

448
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,734
- Well, what was her
last performance?

449
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,100
- She's never done anything.
- No.

450
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,400
- Her's seems to be
a lot of the,

451
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,166
"Up here, dumb character!"

452
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,734
Voice, voice voice!

453
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:06,333
That's all I'm seeing
right now.

454
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,266
- Our accessories
sell our dresses.

455
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:12,166
You know, we'll have halos
and devil horns, devil tail.

456
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,600
- Yeah. It just has to look
really showgirl-y.

457
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,133
- You know, Phi Phi just wants
things so "perfect."

458
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,100
And then they'll say,
"Ooh, your tutu's legs."

459
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,133
- The only thing with
a minidress I'm scared about

460
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,400
is that it's gonna rise up.

461
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,567
- Well, we don't do anything
upside down.

462
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,133
- I'm not gonna go on-stage
and get read

463
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,567
for having my panties show.
Like, that's why.

464
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,567
Sharon's look is never polished.

465
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,533
I just don't feel like her drag
should be even critiqued

466
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:38,667
side-by-side with mine.

467
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,734
This is stressing me out.

468
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:46,967
- Hi, I'm Willam.

469
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,100
- Latrice.
How are you?

470
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,834
- Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Lucian.

471
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,200
- Lucian is RuPaul's producer.

472
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,500
Like, he's the man
behind the magic.

473
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,066
- So are you guys ready
to perform for me,

474
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,533
and then we'll
take it from there?

475
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:58,800
- Sure.

476
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,734
- We'll come out to here,
do the first lines.

477
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,300
We'll move on to the whole show,

478
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,967
and then on the,
"I'm so much better than,"

479
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,700
we'll start walking.
- Oh, I thought--

480
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,133
- You walk in with me.
What, what?

481
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,300
- Yeah, I thought we were gonna
do our lines as we walk.

482
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
- Oh, okay, that's even--
- 'Cause that--yeah.

483
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,834
- That's fine.
- I think that's better.

484
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,734
- Okay.
- Are you guys ready?

485
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,133

I don't know what happened
right there.

528
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,133
- Can we do it again
from the top, please?

529
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,266
- Willam is scrambling,

530
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,800
and she's not in
the right head space.

531
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,767
If either one of us screws up,
we're both screwed.

532

on some of the cues there.

If you don't get
the lines across

544
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,967
and you guys are just doing
physical comedy,

545
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,033
it'll be like, why did she
fall down on the stage?

546
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,333
Or why did this happen?

547
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,633
Really concentrate on the lyrics
and getting those down,

548
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,867
and then, like, have fun.

549
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:22,800
- There's a certain level
of expectation for me

550
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,867
because I've been in
the business for 20 years.

551
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:28,633
I don't want to look like an
idiot in front of America.

559

a little less prepared.

560
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:46,900
They struggled a little bit
with the timing of the lyrics.

In a performance like this,

564
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,734
you guys have really
got to, like, step it up.

565
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,133
- The stress point of
the rehearsal was vocalization.

566
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,400
You throw the choreography

567
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,867

But why don't we Run it again,

Sharon has no rhythm,

then the music's off,

694

695
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,633

something shut twice.

696
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,467

around Willam's liquid.

697

I work with
some of the weirdest,

704
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,900

I think, in America.

705

your guys' lives sound

716
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,633
I haven't come
from a drag family

717
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,567

through the club system

718

719
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:31,233

734
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,100

with any of them?

735
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
- Two of them.

746
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,367
- This week,
the queens were challenged

747
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:47,233
to perform a duet
with their best frenemies.

748
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,567
Tonight, on the main stage,

00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,400
they're gonna make their

00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:20,767
<i>♪ Than you ♪</i>

868
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:21,800
<i>- ♪ So much ♪</i>

869
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,867
<i>- ♪ Better than you ♪</i>

870
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:26,133
- Oh!
Dida, you bitch! Oh!

871
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,133
[laughter]

872
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:30,066
- Thank you.

873
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,233
- Welcome, ladies.

874
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:35,934
This week, we asked you
to combine your strengths

875
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:39,567
and weaknesses to create
one dynamic duo,

876
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:43,967
so tonight,
you'll be judged as a couple.

877
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:47,767
First up, Willam
and Latrice Royale.

878
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,667
Tell us about your performance.

879
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,800
- She has definitely gotten me
out of my comfort zone

880
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,867
a little bit.

881
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,166
[laughter]

882
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:57,433
This is not exactly what
I would do normally,

883
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:59,800
but absolutely loving
that I'm showcasing

884
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,700
the curves and swerves
I represent for the big girls.

885
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,166
- [laughs]

886
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,600
Do you feel that this outfit
compromises your Christianity?

887
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,834
- Jesus is a biscuit,
and I let him sop me up, so--

888
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:10,867
- Yes!

889
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,233
[laughter]

890
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,633
- You guys look amazing.

891
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,600
I love the lingerie,
the stockings.

892
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,834
Your shoes are killer.

893
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,200
- Oh, they're Versace.
- And that pratfall.

894
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,533
I'm using that trick.
That was some Vegas shit.

895
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:26,066
- But sometimes too much shtick
can get in the way.

896
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,633
- You two were sort of
like a Laurel and Hardy

897
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:33,066
or a Jane Russell/Marilyn Monroe
sort of combination.

898
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,900
You're really different,
but you worked so well together

899
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,066
and I really enjoyed it.

900
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,266
- Thank you, ladies.

901
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,133
- I just have to say one thing.
- What's that?

902
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,367
-<i> America's Got Talent</i>
has nothing on this show.

903
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,633
- Uh, hear, hear.

904
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:45,633
- This is a great show,
and there's so much talent

905
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,300
on the stage,
it's fun to see.

906
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,433
- Thanks, Pamela.

907
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,166
- Next up, Chad Michaels
and Dida Ritz.

908
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,633
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi.

909
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,633
- So, Dida, who did it better?
- Uh...

910
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,200
- Just say it, bitch.
- I will say me.

911
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
- That's right.

912
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,500
[laughter]

913
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,734
- What about you, Chad?
- Of course, darling, it was me.

914
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:02,800
[laughter]

915
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,066
- Sorry.

916
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,300
- I was getting a cavity,
listening to you two.

917
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,333
[laughter]

918
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,867
It was so Roxie and Velma.

919
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,567
It was very<i> Chicago,</i>
which I love.

920
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,734
- Well, I feel a little
like Paula Abdul,

921
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,100
'cause I loved everything.

922
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,367
[laughter]

923
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,500
- Dida, sometimes when you get
really, really excited

924
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,433
and you're singing
and you have so much energy,

925
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,166
you kind of lose
a little bit of the vocals.

926
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,867
- I think the jokes may have
fallen a little flat

927
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:27,667
because you couldn't hear
what you were saying.

928
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:31,333
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Phi Phi O'Hara.

929
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,700
How did it feel up there?

930
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,066
- Me and Phi Phi have had
some bad blood here.

931
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:38,233
I've always found it
kind of hard to be accepted

932
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,266
by glamorous pageant-y queens,
and I took a little bit

933
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,200
of that mindset
into this competition.

934
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,900
- Calling her a pageant queen,
is that a read?

935
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,567
- Sharon, you could learn
something from pageant queens.

936
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,834
You're not losing Sharon Needles
in this glam look.

937
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,900
- I love this hair.
- It's gorgeous on you.

938
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,834
- I should have
done this a long--

939
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,400
this is some country crock hair.

940
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,700
- I think you guys were great,

941
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,867
and you look a little Janice
Dickinson and you're me.

942
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,633
- That's what I was channeling.
- I loved it.

943
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,400
- When you came down
to the bottom of the stage,

944
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,367
I loved that you were
trying the harmonies,

945
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,600
but they're a little bit off.

946
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:14,200
- I do feel like the comedy
was underplayed.

947
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,233
I think you guys
should have been funnier.

948
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,400
- Y'all were almost too nice.

949
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,834
It's a frenemies type of thing.

950
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,066
You know, it's kind of like, uh,

951
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,333
you're cutting on each other.

952
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,800
It was hard to even hear

953
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,200
if there was any shade in there.

954
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,500
- Thank you, ladies.

955
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,266
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

956
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,166
the judges and I
will deliberate.

957
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,200
You may leave the stage.

958
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Just between us girls...

959
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
- [sighs]

960
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,300
- What do you think?

961
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,834
Willam and Latrice Royale.

962
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,400
- Latrice stepped out
of her comfort zone,

963
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,567
and it looked great.

964
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,700
Vocally, I thought Willam
could really sing.

965
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,066
I did love their shtick
that they did,

966
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,934
but it kind of
took over the song.

967
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,600
- A little less might have been
a little bit more in this case.

968
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,967
- Well, I thought that their act
was very polished.

969
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,300
I really liked the choreography.

970
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,767
I thought it was very smooth
and it was very worked out.

971
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,967
- Now, would you have them open
for you in Vegas?

972
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,266
- Yes!

973
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,367
Especially with that little--
that thing at the end,

974
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,567
when they threw the purse
and she tripped or whatever.

975
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,433
- Yeah, that was good.
- The pratfall was great.

976
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:18,567
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz,
the ingenue and the veteran.

977
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:21,166
- The duo felt a little lopsided
with Dida's energy

978
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,467
being over the top.

979
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:25,066
- She was so energized,
and that's a great thing,

980
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:28,066
but that can also be
detrimental sometimes.

981
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,333
The microphone was a bit close,
like she gonna swallow it.

982
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,433
- Now, is that a bad thing?

983
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,467
- [laughs]

984
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,100
Not normally.

985
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,734
- All right, let's move on
to Sharon Needles

986
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,767
and Phi Phi O'Hara,
the devil and the angel.

987
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,667
- They started with the
harmonies, and I was like,

988
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:45,066
oh, my God, I'm so impressed.
They're singing in harmo--uh-oh.

989
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,133
Oh.

990
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,533
[laughter]

991
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,700
- I loved their voices together,
but then, I'm tone deaf.

992
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,867
[laughter]

993
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:54,400
And I thought there
could have been used

994
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,233
a little more choreography
at the beginning,

995
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:58,166
but I have no rhythm, so--
- Oh!

996
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,433
[laughs]

997
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,600
- Yesterday, there was some
undercurrent of tension

998
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,633
between them and then, today,
they seemed like

999
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,967
they had their shtick together.

1000
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,300
They knew exactly what they were
doing, but unfortunately,

1001
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,266
their shtick
didn't have a lot of shtick.

1002
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,633
- I did like their outfits.

1003
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,800
I thought that the angel
and devil thing was a good idea,

1004
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,300
but it didn't really deliver,

1005
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,800
because you couldn't even tell
any jabs were being thrown.

1006
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,834
- All right.

1007
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,834
Silence.

1008
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,633
I've made my decision.

1009
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,900
Bring back my girls.

1010
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,900
Welcome back, ladies.

1011
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,266
Based on your frenemies
nightclub act

1012
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:34,867
and your presentations
on the main stage,

1013
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,166
I've made some decisions.

1014
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,333
Now, you are all troupers,
but tonight,

1015
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,667
one duo did it so much better.

1016
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:48,633
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...

1017
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,867
Willam and Latrice Royale.

1018
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:55,867
[applause]

1019
00:36:55,867 --> 00:37:00,700
You each win a custom corset
skirt and brassiere

1020
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,834
of versatilecorsets.Com.

1021
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,433
- I didn't expect to win
this challenge.

1022
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,934
I'm really glad I didn't let
my partner down.

1023
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,834
It's pretty fucking cool.

1024
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:14,600
- That leaves Chad and Dida,

1025
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,767
and Phi Phi and Sharon.

1026
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:23,467
- [groans]

1027
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:28,066
- Ladies, it's come to
a point in the competition

1028
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:31,200
where every decision
is a painful one.

1029
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,867
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles...

1030
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,166
- [vomiting]

1031
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,767
I feel kind of, like,
gut bubbles,

1032
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,400
and I feel really sick.

1033
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,133
I didn't want
to make RuPaul wait.

1034
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,500
I didn't want to make
any of the guest judges wait.

1035
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm sorry.

1036
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,633
So I tried to throw up
off the stage.

1037
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:59,734
- It's really not cute.

1038
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:03,066
- Willam, are you okay
to continue?

1039
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,133
All right.

1040
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:07,100
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles,

1041
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,567
you are up for elimination.

1042
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:16,934
Chad Michaels, Dida Ritz,
you may join the other girls.

1043
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,867
- I was nice to Sharon,
and it backfired.

1044
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,166
You know what?
I'm done.

1045
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,467
I'm not playing nice
with you anymore.

1046
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,700
- Two queens stand before me.

1047
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,133
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1048
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,800
and save yourselves
from elimination.

1049
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:39,900
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.

1050
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,567
- I don't want to go home,
plain and simple.

1051
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:49,066
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

1052
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:50,467

1053

My wig was hanging on
by one freakin' bobby pin.

1075
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm not keeping
that bitch on my head.

1076
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,367

1085
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:49,867

00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,867
This is tough to watch,
because you don't know

1091
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,266

[cheers and applause]

1104
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:32,767
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.

1105
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,734
- I'm very fucking nervous.

1106
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:37,367
It was my first time
having my fate

1107
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:41,100
dangled in front of my face.

1108
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,600
- Willam, will you please
step forward.

1109
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:59,133
- What the hell is happening?

1110
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:02,433
- Willam, you won tonight

1111
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:06,567
because you are a beautiful
and talented queen,

1112
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:11,433
but it has come to my attention

1113
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:15,066
that you have broken the Rules--

1114
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,934
Rules that are in place
to protect the fairness

1115
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,800
of this competition.

1116
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,567
Your actions have consequences,

1117
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,967
and I'm afraid
you leave me no choice.

1118
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:29,734
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition

1119
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:32,200
immediately.

1120
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,333
Now, sashay away.

1121
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,066
- I broke the Rules,
but I'm a big boy

1122
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:48,700
dressed in big girl's clothes,

1123
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,400
so regret's kind of like
a fool's game.

1124
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,934
I can't change anything
that I did,

1125
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:54,266
and there's no use spending
any time dwelling on it.

1126
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:57,500
I stood on stage, sick,
with a 24-inch-waist,

1127
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,567
and I'm proud of myself.

1128
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,066
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles,

1129
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:10,266
in light of tonight's events,
you got lucky.

1130
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:13,867
You are both safe.

1131
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,200
Shante, you stay.

1132
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,467
[applause]

1133
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:23,633
You may join the other girls.

1134
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:28,100
My fierce five, let this
be a warning to all of you,

1135
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,533
in the race to become
America's next drag superstar,

1136
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:35,600
sometimes a queen's worst enemy
can be herself.

1137
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,333
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1138
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,233
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1139
00:42:40,233 --> 00:42:42,100
Can I get an amen up in here?

1140
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,266
all: Amen.

1141
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,900
- All right.
Now let the music play.

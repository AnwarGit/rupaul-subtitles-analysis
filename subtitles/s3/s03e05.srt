it's a very serious thing.

It kind of like lit a light bulb

y'all didn't have to grab me.
- Yeah.

No, I'm not a violent person.

Miss Visage said she didn't know
if I'm a bitch,

whether she tweets, blogs,

82

or just talks smack
behind some t-girl's back.

83
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,467
Remember, an informed queen
is a winning queen,

and that's the way it is.

85

have to be in control
of their public image.

you need to create
a quick drag look

94
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,900
for an outrageous photo op
on the red carpet.

95
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,934
You have ten minutes
to pull it together

before the photographers from
Polite in Public arrive.

- Ooh, scandal!

105
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,867
- The first thing I think about
is, like, the crotch shot.

106
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,867
In order to create a fake vag,

107
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,166
it's all about the way that you
tuck and fold your skin.

108
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,600
I noticed Shangela was kind of
doing something similar.

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,433
I could put on a pair of
pantyhose and put on some fuzz,

110
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,734
you know, but this is,
like, real.

111
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,133
It's like a double take.

112
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,500
- All right, here we go.

113
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,967
- Oh!

three pictures.

00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,567
- So is it okay that my face
is not gonna be in the frame?

126
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,600
I mean, 'cause it's about here.

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
- Yeah, whatever you wanna do.

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,767
And I appreciate you sharing
your inner dialogue,

129
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,934
but we're gonna take that
picture right now.

130
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:43,900

Yes, Miss Jackson
if you're nasty,

00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,133
you better
put that nipple away.

00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,066
Yes, take that, Harvey Levin.

138
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,066
Wow, look at the size
of that rock.

139
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,467
And that ring's not bad, either.

140
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,367
Ooh, that was scandalous.

141
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,934
- Kind of basing this off
real life, a little bit.

142
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,166
- You have a similar story?

143
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,867

The red bow tie really dresses
that outfit up.

Something tells me your tuck's
gonna come undone.

150
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,133
- Let's just make sure that
doesn't happen.

182
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,100
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

183
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,367
- Oh, my god, you know,

184
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:47,066
finally my fat ass
has won something.

185
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:51,400
So these bitches better
watch the fuck out.

186
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,900
- Condragulations.

187
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,233
You are the queens
of morning television.

188
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,500
all: Ooh.

189
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,066
- For today's main challenge,

190
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,500
you'll split into two teams

191
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,633
to broadcast
a morning news show.

192
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,500
Each team consists of
two co-anchors,

193
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,066
a weather girl, a gossip gal,

194
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,567
and a roving reporter,

195
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,867
who'll be interviewing

196
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:15,333
celebrity guest
Kristin Cavallari.

197
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,133
all: Ohh.

198
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,066
- Carmen and Stacy,

199
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,967
you are our team captains.

200
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,066
Stacy, you get to pick first.

201
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,867
- I just hope Stacy
don't pick me.

202
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:30,133
Because that team is going to
crash and burn.

203
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,834
- Alexis.

204
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:32,934
- Manila.

205
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:33,967
- Ooh!

206
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,166
- Shangela.

207
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,166
- Ooh.

208
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,633
- Mm, Raja.

209
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,133
- Come on, girl, that's it.

210
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:42,333
- Yara Sofia.

211
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,700
- Delta Work.

212
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,300
- India and Mariah are
the two girls left standing.

213
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,066
- Mariah Carey.

214
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,066
- Me?
- Is she here?

215
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,834
- India Ferrah,
you are on Carmen's team.

216
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,433
- I end up with India.

217
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,300
She was in the bottom
last challenge,

218
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,500
and I don't want to
have to baby anybody.

219
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,367
- These are your news teams.

220
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,133
You will broadcasting live.

221
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,300
- What?

222
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,700
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

223
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,200
And may the best newswoman win.

224
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
- I would like to be...glossy.

225
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,967
Just serious but funny
at the same time.

226
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,667
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?

227
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,567
- Are we gonna take this, like,
more on a serious note?

228
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,500
- I don't know--what,
you're the team leader.

229
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,734
You tell me.

230
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:31,233
Is it gonna be like fun-serious
or fun, like spoof?

231
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,600
- We gonna have to figure out

232
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
this as a team.

233
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,734
Right now,
Stacy is actually clueless.

234
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,667
- I'm gonna be
the gossip reporter,

235
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,200
because I love to
fuckin' gossip.

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,834
- News anchor one
is gonna be Raja.

237
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:49,800
News anchor two
is going to be...

238
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,867
Delta.

239
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:54,900
Who wants to do weather girl?

240
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,467
No one wants to be weather girl.

241
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,367
But I don't really see it
for India to be interviewer,

242
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,233
because India can get boring
sometimes.

243
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,667
You're gonna be
the roving reporter.

244
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,367
- Okay, work.
I'll do the interview.

245
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,066
- Weather girl
is gonna be India.

246
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,133
- So I end up with weather girl,

247
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,133
and, honestly, I'm hating it.

248
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,800
But what kind of weather girl?
What should I wear?

249
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,734
- Let's just do a quickie,
just so we get used to it.

250
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,934
- Live from the QNN news center,
I'm Raja Fantaja.

251
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,066
- I'm Carmen Carrera,

252
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,200
and I've got all the tea
in my kiki report.

253
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
- Weather girl.

254
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,533
- Oh, is it me now?

255
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,500
- I'm worried for India
a little bit.

256
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,767
- Hey, uh, does anyone know
how much time we have?

257
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,200
- We have like
an hour and a half or so.

258
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,066
- Our main challenge
is to split into two teams

259
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,767
and create a morning news show.

260
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:38,767
- Remember this?

261
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:39,834
- Oh, with a bow on it.

262
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,300
- Yeah, this is
my newscaster look.

263
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,500
- Yeah, mine's kind of
muted too,

264
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,633
so that'll look good.

265
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,300
Delta and I have
a great dynamic together

266
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,533
and a chemistry.

267
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,333
So we knew that the banter
was going to be great.

268
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,467
- So what do you think?

269
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,200
What do you got?
- Yeah, I have no clue.

270
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,233
- I've got this.

271
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,333
It's a little skirt and jacket.

272
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,300
- Oh, yeah, that'll work.
Right?

273
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,367
- Is that, like, too bright?

274
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,200
- No, we're drag queens, honey.

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,633
- I feel that India
is a little bit

276
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,367
more concerned about her outfit

277
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,333
rather than her character
and knowing her lines.

278
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,700
Last time
she didn't do so good,

279
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,900
so it's like now I want her
to really prove herself.

280
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,900
I really want her to do well.

281
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,266
- I-I don't understand this one.

282
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,133
Like, just how nippy--

283
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,233
can you say this for me?

284
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,300
- Nippy, it's like cold.

285
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,967
- No, I know, I know.
But it's--

286
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,066
- It's getting a bit nippy
out there.

287
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:25,367
- I asked Stacy if
I could be the weather girl.

288
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,834
Even though speaking English
is kind of difficult.

289
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:33,266
- Hell, no, storm brewing
deep in the heart of Texas.

290
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,400
- Um, um, Shangela, could you...

291
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,233
- I can say it in Spanish.

292
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,433
- I'm listening to Yara

293
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,233
actually deliver her lines,

294
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,800
and I'm getting a little
worried, you know.

295
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,333
I picked this bitch
for a reason.

296
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,867
She better deliver.

297
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,233
- Hello, hello, hello!

298
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,367
all: Hi.

299
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,433
- So, Carmen,
you're a team captain again.

300
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,433
- Yeah.

301
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,266
- So what roles did you assign?

302
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,800
- Well, I'm gonna be
the gossip girl.

303
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,834
- Okay.

304
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,300
- We're gonna have Manila
interview.

305
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,467
- What is your interview style?

306
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,133
- I'm kind of channeling, like,

307
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,066
the best queens of interview.

308
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,100
- Like who?

309
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,300
- Like Mario Lopez
or Ryan Seacrest.

310
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,367
- Ah, okay, I love it.

311
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,767
[laughter]

312
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,900
- Raja is anchor one.

313
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,867
- Have you ever done
any anchoring before?

314
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,166
Any teleprompter?

315
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,433
- No, but I've pretended
quite a bit when I'm alone.

316
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,734
[laughter]

317
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,834
- And then we have Delta's
anch--uh, anchor two.

318
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:21,834
- From the desert to the sea,

319
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,333
to wherever there's tea.

320
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,700
- [laughing]

321
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,066
Is that your tagline?

322
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,633
- That's our tagline.
- I love it!

323
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,166
That's perfect.

324
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,567
- [singsong]
Bo-ring.

325
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:31,900
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,700
- Um, we're gonna have India
as the weather girl.

327
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
That may be the hardest part.

328
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,133
- Yes, it might be.

329
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,367
But, you know, I'm kind of going
with a little ghetto twist.

330
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,433
- Uh-huh.

331
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,834
- You know,
because you gotta be like,

332
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,667
"Girl, you know, it's gettin'
sunny outside, so..."

333
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,867
- That's you being ghetto?

334
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,300
- Yeah.
- [laughing] Oh, that's...

335
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
Well, I can't wait.

336
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,266
I know you all
have a lot of work to do,

337
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,500
a lot of makeup to put on.

338
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,367
I'm gonna let you get to work.

339
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,367
- The opening, the opening.

340
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,400
I love the opening.

341
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,467
- Okay.

342
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:59,400
- Well, hello,
team Stacy Layne Matthews.

343
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,233
all: Hi.
- How's it going?

344
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,333
- It's going great, honey.

345
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,600
- So who's who?

346
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,900
- Yara is our, um, weather girl.

347
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,467
- Okay.
- You know miss Shangela,

348
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,200
honey, she's our own
gossip columnist.

349
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,333
- Okay.

350
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,600
- This is my sidekick,
reporter number two.

351
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,500
And this is our roving reporter.

352
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,367
- How are you faring
as a team leader?

353
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,734
- I think I'm doing good, and,

354
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,066
you know, we all just organizing

355
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,734
things, you know, and it's--

356
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,433
- You said we all organizing.

357
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,400
You're organizing,
or we all organizing?

358
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,734
- We're working as a group.

359
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,300
- So now, you've made yourself

360
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,533
one of the anchors, right?

361
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,667
- Yes.

362
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,433
- You got some criticism
from the judge panel

363
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,133
that you weren't, you know,

364
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,433
you're not really the most
outrageous person on the planet.

365
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:41,700
- I can be.

366
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,266
- I'm...we wanna see that.

367
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,633
- Being from a small town,

368
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,533
it just sets me apart
from the other competition,

369
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,600
because I'm a little rough
around the edges.

370
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm not as polished
as the other girls,

371
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,066
but, you know, I represent.

372
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,100
- Now, Yara, you're gonna be

373
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
working on a green screen.

374
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
Practice with me.

375
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,767
If the map of the United States

376
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:03,567
was behind you,
where is Florida?

377
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,500
- Florida's right here.

378
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,734
- Yeah.
Where's Maine?

379
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,433
- Maine?
- Maine.

380
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,400
- Where is Maine?

381
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,433
- Uh, now, where's New York?

382
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,467
- Um, right there.
- Yes.

383
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,500
And where's the North Pole?
- Ah, over there.

384
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,567
[laughter]

385
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,767
- Now, Alexis, you're gonna be

386
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,734
reading off of a teleprompter.

387
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,400
Do you feel comfortable
with that?

388
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
- I just gonna hope
that I do very well.

389
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,533
This is gonna be
a learning experience.

390
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,066
- Now, Mariah, you're gonna be
the roving reporter.

391
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,800
- Yes, I get to interview
Kristin.

392
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm going to first start out
with where she's from.

393
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,066
Touch base on, you know,
her achievements

394
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,300
on film and television,

395
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,667
and then I also
want to touch base

396
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,900
on some of her charitable works.

397
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,867
- How much time do you have?
- Three minutes.

398
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,333
- Three minutes
is not a lot of time.

399
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,333
- I have an outline,

400
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,700
and I have base points
to touch on,

401
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,667
and I'm gonna get to
every single one of those,

402
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,567
and they lead to
the next question.

403
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,667
- Right, this is really about

404
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,066
your own personality.

405
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,967
That's really
what we want to see.

406
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,166
Ladies, to help you get your

407
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,300
charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

408
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,767
ready for morning television,

409
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:06,600
you'll be receiving
a crash course in media training

410
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,266
by veteran broadcaster
Debbie Matenopoulos.

411
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,300
[all gasp]

412
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,166
You know her from<i> The View.</i>

413
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,700
- Bitch, we find out
that miss Debbie,

414
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,066
honey, from<i> The View</i>

415
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,967
is gonna be giving us feedback
about our performances.

416
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,600
I mean, this shit is, like,
serious and exciting, honey.

417
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,333
And I cannot wait to hear
what this bitch has got to say.

418
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,800
- All right, news flash:

419
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,667
Don't fuck it up.

420
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:30,600
- Okay.

421
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,133
- I'll see you all later.

422
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,166
All right.

423
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,233
all: Thank you.

424
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,767
- Thanks for the tip.

425
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:39,066
[upbeat music]

426
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:43,100
- Team Stacy Layne Matthews
has entered the news room.

427
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,834
Say hello to
Debbie Matenopoulos.

428
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:46,934
all: Hi, Debbie, how are you?

429
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,834
- Hi, you gorgeous creatures.

430
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,166
- Now, Debbie's here
to walk you through

431
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,367
some of the technical aspects
of being in a news room.

432
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:58,867
And then we are going
all the way live.

433
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:02,200
Three, two, one.

434
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,700
- This just in:
Scientists have announced a cure

435
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,500
for hetosexural--
heterosexuality.

436
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,433
I've never, you know,
been in front of a teleprompter.

437
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,500
Slow that shit down.
I got to read.

438
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,533
- Side effects include diarrhea,
sudden baldness,

439
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,166
and an uncro--
uncontrollable urge

440
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:20,133
to dress age inappropriately.

441
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,834
- Wow, that's a great discovery,
girl.

442
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,166
- Yes, honey.
- Yes.

443
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,333
- You two are the main anchors.
You have to set the tone.

444
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,734
So at the top of a show,
be up, up, up.

445
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,066
- Hey, Yara Sofia,

446
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,934
how are things looking
out there today?

447
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,100
- Down here, there is a--

448
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,900
hurricane carnage.

449
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh!
It's just right there.

450
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,700
There's a barometric dropping.

451
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,600
Oh! Ohh!
Almost burned my ass.

452
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,767
Oh, my god.

453
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,200
- Girl!

454
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,834
You forced me to believe
everything you said,

455
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,066
although I didn't
understand a word.

456
00:15:56,066 --> 00:16:01,066
Slow down<i> or</i><span style="bodyStyle"> don't even speak</i>
a word of English.

457
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:04,133
- Now
it's Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

458
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,133
- Now, listen, the next
drag superstar wannabes

459
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,567
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews

460
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,934
were the talk of the town

461
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:13,133
after creating a huge scene
last night on the red carpet.

462
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,734
Honey, it was<i> escandalo!</i>

463
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,100
Yara Sofia,<i> escandalo?</i>

464
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,133
Honey chile, yes.

465
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,400
That's right.

466
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,734
- You were giving me
the attitude

467
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:24,400
that you knew exactly
what you were doing.

468
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,133
You were sailing the ship.

469
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,500
I could take a note
or two from you.

470
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,934
- I'm here with
Kristin Cavallari.

471
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,500
So...so...

472
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,800
all the scandal.

473
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,266
Around the town
with Justin Brody,

474
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,066
and you have Shawn--

475
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,066
- Justin Bobby.

476
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,333
- Justin Bobby.

477
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,300
But you've been spotted
with Nick as well.

478
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
- Who?

479
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,934
- Uh, Corzone.

480
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,934
Am I saying his name wrong?
- Nick Carzone.

481
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:49,867
- I had some facts that I didn't
have completely together.

482
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,400
- There are times where I have
had my facts completely wrong.

483
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,667
And it's okay,
as long as you can recover.

484
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,767
- Okay.

485
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,133
- Oh, my god, look at the time.

486
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,367
We're almost on the air!

487
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,400
places, people!

488
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Places!

489
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
- It's time to go live,

490
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,667
and I was so scared
about my English.

491
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,233
And how I can deliver
my personality.

492
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:14,066
- Count it down in three, two...

493
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,467
- Live from the QNN news center,

494
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,934
Stacy Layne Matthews...

495
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,400
Alexis Mateo...

496
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,233
Yara Sofia...

497
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,900
Shangela Laquifa Wadley...

498
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,667
and Mariah.

499
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:30,467
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.

500
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,100
- Live from the QNN news center,

501
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,266
I'm Stacy Matthews.

502
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,567
Just in, scientists
have announced a cure

503
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,100
for heterosexuality.

504
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,567
- I am so glad that pill
just came out.

505
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,667
- Yes, girl.

506
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,967
- We're suffering
here in United States.

507
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,100
- Honey.

508
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,533
- It's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather.

509
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,066
- What's going on?

510
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,333
Ohh!

511
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,066
It is raining men down there!

512
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:58,633
[speaking Spanish]

513
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:02,533
Okay! Rainbow right here!

514
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,166
Oh, my god, that's so gay.

515
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,767
But it's so good.

516
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,734
That's a wrap on the weather,

517
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,133
I'm Yara Sofia.

518
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,100
- Let me just say, I do think

519
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,233
"It's so good, but it's so gay"

520
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,867
is my new favorite phrase.

521
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:15,900
I love that, Yara.

522
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,166
Listen, honey, let me tell you.

523
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,100
Which A-list action hunk

524
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,133
is finally
coming out of the closet?

525
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,300
I'll just tell you this:

526
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,233
He's so gay, and he's so good.

527
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:27,233
Listen, it's
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,

528
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,300
and that's your daily
kiki report.

529
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,967
Back to you, Stacy and Alexis.

530
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:34,066
- Mariah, over to you, honey.

531
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,867
- Hi, ladies.
Good morning.

532
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:40,133
I'm here, Mariah,
with Kristin Cavallari.

533
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,166
So are you working
on any new projects?

534
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,400
- I'm working on
a shoe line right now,

535
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,533
which I'm really excited about.

536
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,633
- Oh, perfect.
I'm excited about that too.

537
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:52,367
So, were you really born
a genetic woman?

538
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,400
- [laughs]

539
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,700
I was, yes.

540
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,900
- Oh, darn, girls.

541
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
We can't claim her for our team.

542
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,934
So, back to you
in the news room, QNN.

543
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,333
- Well, that's all
for the Morning After News.

544
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,834
Stay tuned for the same news,

545
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:05,900
different anchors.

546
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,066
- All right, that's a wrap.

547
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,700
- Welcome, team Carmen!

548
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,266
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

549
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,200
It's time for the morning news!

550
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
- Pour yourself
another cup of ambition,

551
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,800
because this is
the Morning After News.

552
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,166
- Today's breaking story:

553
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,567
We'll have the latest on
that horrific freak accident

554
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,300
that killed so many innocent
little people last night.

555
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,934
- Loosen up some.
You two are the anchors,

556
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,200
and you have to drive the ship,

557
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,066
but you also wanna be likable.

558
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,467
- It's Carmen Carrera.

559
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,133
- Next drag superstar wannabes

560
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,266
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews

561
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,667
were the talk of the town

562
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,300
after creating a huge scene
on the red carpet last night.

563
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,533
I didn't even know I was there!

564
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,066
- Performance is a little bit
flat.

565
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,066
- In Provincetown...

566
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,367
Massachusetts...

567
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:53,567
I'm like, "Girl, just like,

568
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,667
pictures what, like,
Al Roker would do."

569
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,767
There is the barometric
pressure.

570
00:19:58,767 --> 00:19:59,900
It's dropping.

571
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,400
- The weather people
are the personality.

572
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,000
They have carte blanche to be,
"Girl!"

573
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,467
I'm still waiting for your
personality to come through.

574
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,834
India, this is the time.

575
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,433
- Manila, over to you.

576
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,667
- [Asian accent]
Thank you, Delta.

577
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,033
So...Kristin...

578
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,133
you were on two hit TV show!

579
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:22,233
Tell us, how has that
changed your life?

580
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,500
- It just made me move
up to L.A. and pursue acting.

581
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,633
- What year you born?

582
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,300
- Uh, '87.

583
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,100
- Oh! Me too.

584
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
You are the cock.

585
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,533
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

586
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,934
Rooster, rooster.

587
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:34,467
- [laughing]

588
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,500
- When you weren't pronouncing
your Ls and your Rs,

589
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,266
I thought
it was a terrible decision.

590
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,300
But, you know what?

591
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,166
That never hurt Barbara Walters.

592
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,133
It's time for the morning news.

593
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,367
We are going live.

594
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,800
- I'm very nervous
before the broadcast,

595
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,667
because this team
is depending on me to do good.

596
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,266
So I'm just like, "Ugh."

597
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,967
- I'm gonna count it down...

598
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,800
in three, two, one.

599
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,767
- Live from the QNN news center,
Raja...

600
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,400
Delta Work...

601
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,066
India Ferrah...

602
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,867
Carmen Carrera...

603
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,834
and Manila Luzon.

604
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,633
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.

605
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,300
- Live from the QNN news center,
I am Raja.

606
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,533
- And I'm Delta Work.

607
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:22,500
- Lookin' sexy.

608
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,367
- So do you.
I love you in pink.

609
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,367
- Thanks.

610
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,567
- [gasps]

611
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,100
- Now let's go to the gal
with all the gossip,

612
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,166
it's Carmen Carrera.

613
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,266
- Ugh, I have so much tea
for you.

614
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,633
Which A-list action hunk
is finally

615
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,567
coming out of the closet?

616
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, let's just say
he was at my house last night.

617
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,433
both: Ooh!

618
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,367
- Well, it's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather girl.

619
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,400
Hey, India, how are things

620
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,467
looking out there today?

621
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,600
- Now...deep in the heart
of Texas, y'all--

622
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
y'all feelin' me?

623
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
There is a hell no storm.

624
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
Okay?

625
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,500
In the heartland,
a rainbow has appeared

626
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,300
in the Gayville
of South Dakota.

627
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,967
This is India Ferrah
with Drag-U-weather.

628
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,533
Back to you, Raja and Delta.

629
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,066
- Thanks, weather grr.

630
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,100
Manila, over to you.

631
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
- [Asian accent]
Kristin!

632
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,433
Now that the final episode

633
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,066
of<i> The Hills</i><span style="bodyStyle"> has aired,</i>
what's next?

634
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,367
- Right now,
I'm really focusing

635
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,300
on my shoe line
that I'm designing.

636
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
- Oh, shoes.
I love shoes.

637
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,266
- I think every girl
loves shoes.

638
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,333
- You don't have boyfriend?

639
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,767
- I don't, I'm single.

640
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,066
- Ooh, I have brother.

641
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,867
You should hook up with him.

642
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,367
You should marry.
Immigration.

643
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,767
Lots of money.

644
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:33,800
- [laughing]

645
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,233
- Back to you in the studio,

646
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,734
Raja and Delta.

647
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:37,800
- From the desert to the sea

648
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,834
to wherever there's tea,
I'm Delta Work.

649
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:45,066
We hope the rest of your day
is a big ol' drag.

650
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:48,734
- Ladies, your newscasts
will be played for the judges

651
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,166
tomorrow night
on the main stage,

652
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,934
where we will be joined
by our guest judge,

653
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,667
Academy-Award-nominated actress,

654
00:22:55,667 --> 00:23:00,900
from HBO's<i> Big Love,</i>
Chloe Sevigny.

655
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,233
[all gasp]

656
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,600
- I love Chloe.

657
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,934
Not only is she
an amazing actress,

658
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,200
but she's a fashion icon
at this point.

659
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
- So come decked out in your
most fabulous drag looks.

660
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,767
On behalf
of Debbie Matenopoulos,

661
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,967
I'm RuPaul,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

662
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,266
- Can I come in?

663
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,367
- No.

664
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:25,867
- We're back
in the workroom today,

665
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,834
and we have to put together
our fiercest drag look.

666
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:29,967
- How do you think our team did?

667
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,233
- I think our team is great.

668
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:33,800
I think we're not gonna
have a problem with that.

669
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,066
- I'm a little nervous.

670
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,967
I mean, if our news piece comes
out really shitty,

671
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,467
it's gonna be on me.

672
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,800
- I feel confident that we all,

673
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,467
on our team, did a good job.

674
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:43,567
- Change the subject.

675
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,066
I don't want to talk about this
anymore.

676
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,734
[laughter]

677
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,100
- India.
- What's up?

678
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,934
What went down on y'all's team
yesterday?

679
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:52,333
Everything went good
except for

680
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,133
the run-through with me
with the weather girl.

681
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,100
- Who else was on your team?
- Carmen.

682
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,433
- She's your team captain,
though, right?

683
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,834
Well, if you want to call it
that.

684
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,667
I'm just calling it like it is.

685
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:04,100
Carmen's only strategy was just
for her to pick her part.

686
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,667
I think she should be more like,

687
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,100
"Bitch, we need to win
this challenge.

688
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,333
Like, let's practice.
Let's get our roles down."

689
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,967
But you know, she just went on
about her business.

690
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,200
Bitch, I got stuck
with the weather girl.

691
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,567
Looking, trying
to read cue cards,

692
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,834
pushing this button,
trying to point at the map.

693
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,834
My performance yesterday
was horrible, you know.

694
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,967
I feel like I'm gonna be in
the bottom two again, honestly.

695
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:24,767
Like, I don't think
I stepped up my game,

696
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,266
and I'll see what happens.

697
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,400
Never again, bitch.

698
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,066
I'm not cut out
to be weather girl.

699
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,767
- For today's
runway presentation,

700
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:34,834
we actually have to bring

701
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,900
our most fabulous
drag-tastic outfits.

702
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,433
I need to get to my glue gun.

703
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,734
Ugh!
I have so much to do.

704
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:45,500
I do not want to be the one
lipsynching for my life.

705
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,333
Okay--Stacy.

706
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,233
- I actually overheard her

707
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,233
saying that I fucked it up.

708
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,567
- Do you think you did good
in this challenge?

709
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,500
- I think I did all right.
Let's be honest.

710
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,066
I fucked it up.
I did.

711
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,133
I'm very nervous that I'm
going to be in the bottom two

712
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,066
and have to lip-synch
for my life

713
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:16,767
and probably go home.

714
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,233
- My home girl, Miss Stacy.

715
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,233
Now, you know we're two
country girls.

716
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:23,433
But Alexis and I were both
engaged in pageant life,

717
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:27,567
and more so than pageants,
we're performers.

718
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,600
Would you ever compete
in a pageant, Raja?

719
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,900
- It's not my thing.

720
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,133
My name is Raja, so--

721
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,834
I can't do that.
I'm way too rock and roll.

722
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,333
- First thing
out of her mouth was,

723
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,767
"I don't do all that
'do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.'"

724
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:40,834
That's a stereotype.

725
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,300
- We don't smile
like Miss America.

726
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,166
Like, it's all about personality
and what you--who you are.

727
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,166
- The whole pageant thing
is really new to me.

728
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,633
We don't have that
in California.

729
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,834
- We do.

730
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,100
I'm the current California
Entertainer of the Year.

731
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,400
- Shangela is California
Miss EOY, honey,

732
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,767
and she is really passionate
about that.

733
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,800
She definitely let us all know.

734
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,700
- I've been in California
working it longer than you have.

735
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,834
- I adore Shangela,

736
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:04,533
but when I see
that little glimpse of,

737
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:08,533
like, entitlement, when you've
only been doing drag for...

738
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,700
minutes,
I don't think it's cool.

739
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,333
I think you have to be
an artist.

740
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,567
- It sounds to me
like you're saying

741
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,567
that people
who compete in pageants

742
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:15,867
aren't performance artists.

743
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,633
- Oh, stop it, Shangela.
I didn't say that.

744
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:18,767
- I'm listening.

745
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,200
- How is it your art form

746
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,367
if you're doing the art
under somebody else's rules?

747
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,734
- Thank you.

748
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,333
- You can defend her
'cause it's your best friend.

749
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,867
- I'm defending her
because she's right.

750
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:30,133
Shangela decided that
when you start talking

751
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,867
about a pageant,
you're attacking her.

752
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,433
- Girl, it's like
the<i> West Side Story.</i>

753
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:35,300
Bitches is like, "Ha, ha, ha!"

754
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,200
- It's not part of
our drag culture, though.

755
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,567
I think this is
a really new thing.

756
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,533
- Well, then y'all
defeated yourself already.

757
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,100
- No, I don't want to be
in a pageant.

758
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,333
No, but what if--

759
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,233
- Wait, time out.
Yeah, you're right, Raja.

760
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,967
- That's the performance
I wanted to do, what if--

761
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,433
- You're getting real
confrontational with me,

762
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,734
but I'm just saying other people

763
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,934
could do unique forms of art,
and they could also win.

764
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:56,400
- That was kind of heated.

Sally Kirkland,

like that, on the red carpet.

Carmen Carrera.

00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,166
What could she be reading about?

815
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,066
- I handmade that whole thing.

816
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,367
So I'm just hoping
nothing falls off.

817
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,633
There's no strap to my top,

Ooh.

This is her more tasteful

I'm giving a little glamorous
India, you know?

Kind of old Hollywood.

I don't have my breastplate on,

because, you know,

843
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,567
I'm showing them
a versatile side of me.

844
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:32,633
- She's a lady.

845
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,166
- She's giving

the first thing I think about
is, "Smile, bitch."

852
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:47,533
They're really enjoying it,

853
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,467
because they haven't seen
this side of me before.

854
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,200
- I feel like she has
a puppy on her head.

855
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,767
- Is that a puppy on her head?

856
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,066

871
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,667
the cape, and I take it off.

872
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,100

Look at the body.

873
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,867

you're not the only one."

- It's fashion week.

879
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,700
- There's your Westwood,
right there.

880
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,934
- I'm really, really inspired

881
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:44,300

and Marie Antoinette.

882
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,900
All things sort of French.

remember who did that?

886
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,700
- We've got our cover.
- For sure.

887
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,934
- Yeah.

888
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:59,367
- Ladies,
I asked you to dazzle us,

889
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,266
and dazzle you did.

890
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,800
After this week's
main challenge,

891
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,433
morning television
will never be the same.

892
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,734
You hear that, Kathie Lee?

893
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,367
Earlier, the judges screened

894
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:15,166
your full live newscasts.

895
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,667
Now, ladies, I have
a little news for you.

896
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:23,500
Alexis Mateo,
you have immunity this week.

897
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,667
Raja, Yara Sofia,

898
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:29,500
Carmen Carrera, Delta Work.

899
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,867
You're all safe.

900
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,600
You may leave the stage.

901
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,433
- Thank you.

902
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,133
- Ladies, the five of you

903
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:48,800
represent the best and the worst
of this week.

904
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,867
It's time
for the judges' critiques.

905
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,300
Let's start with Manila.

906
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,233
- As over-the-top
as the performance was,

907
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,300
I really enjoyed it.

908
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,633
- Kristin Cavallari,
my brother, ho fun.

909
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:06,266
- I literally cried.

910
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:12,200
I mean, I thought that it was
brilliant on so many levels.

911
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,467
- Manila was a star tonight.
- Thank you.

912
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,700
- With that type of thing,
it cannot be half-assed.

913
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,734
And you went completely there,
did not break character.

914
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,100
It was fantastic.

915
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,667
But as far as the look goes,
it's absolutely flawless.

916
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,700
- It was so wrong...
that it was so right.

917
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,667
And truthfully, if you're
gonna be groundbreaking,

918
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,467
some eggs have gotta be broken
to make an omelet.

919
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:34,633
- If someone watching tonight
were offended by what you did,

920
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,367
how would you answer to that?

921
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,467
- I don't think we have enough
Asian people in pop culture.

922
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,633
So I'm here to entertain.

923
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm here to be farcical.

924
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,300
And just trying to do my job.

925
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,467
- All right, next up, Shangela.

926
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:51,867
- The accessories
might have been

927
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,734
a little over-the-top
for my taste.

928
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,700
Maybe one of the bracelets
would have worked better.

929
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,066
- I think that it could be
a little bit less eye makeup.

930
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:01,667
- I loved this look tonight
for you.

931
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,567
I thought it was very pretty,
very sassy.

932
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,500
Not so much stuff lighting up
and lanterns

933
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,667
and this, that,
and the other thing.

934
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,867
You know, gossip on the radio
is my thing,

935
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,433
and you served it.

936
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,433
You did a great, great job.

937
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,834
- You could tomorrow
go to any local show

938
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,800
in this market in los Angeles

939
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,233
and say, "I wanna do your
entertainment news on a Friday;

940
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,800
take a shot on me,"

941
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,100
and I think they'd have
a hard time telling you no.

942
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,066
- What I saw in that broadcast

943
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:30,100
is what--the potential I saw
in your audition.

944
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,667
And I'm very proud of you, mama.

945
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,900
India Ferrah.

946
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,200
What was it like broadcasting

947
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
live as our weather girl?

948
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,867
- I had so much confusion
going on.

949
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:42,100
I didn't know where to go.

950
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,333
Cue cards were on the sides.

951
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,066
Like, I was lost, definitely.

952
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,433
- When India came out, I was

953
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:49,233
very impressed with her grace
and posture.

954
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,133
But the dress not so much.

955
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:56,834
- It was you reciting
what they told you to say.

956
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,467
And I think it did fall flat.

957
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:01,767
- What I wanted to see
was more of you.

958
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:05,467
- I wanna know what's keeping
you from bustin' out?

959
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,600
- Honestly, I don't know.

960
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,233
I don't know
if it's nervousness...

961
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,900
- I don't know what to tell you,

962
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:15,600
but the time to jump on it
is yesterday.

963
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Next up,
the queen we call Mariah.

964
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,734
- I think she's stunning.

965
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,066
I mean, absolutely beautiful.

966
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:24,367
I think if I saw you, I'd think
you were a real woman.

967
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:26,266
I mean, you could give Naomi
a run for her money,

968
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,500
you know, on any catwalk.

969
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
- But Naomi would probably
throw a phone at her.

970
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,066
- I would catch it
and throw it back.

971
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:32,100
- Thank you.

972
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
- When the interviewing process
started,

973
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,200
I was getting
a little concerned,

974
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,700
and then it turned
for the better.

975
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,066
- So you're better known
for<i> The Hills.</i>

976
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,300
- Mm-hmm.

977
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,400
- But you're becoming
quite the man-eater.

978
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,734
- Mariah, you are what we call
a grower, not a shower.

979
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,934
When the interviewing process
started,

980
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,066
I was getting
a little concerned,

981
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,333
and then it turned
for the better.

982
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,333
But I thought
you looked stunning.

983
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,133
- I agree with
what Michelle said.

984
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,934
However, they don't give you
a second shot.

985
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,233
Three, two, one,
the camera's on--

986
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,367
it's sink or swim, right now,

987
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:03,200
'cause nobody cares--it's live.

988
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,467
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

989
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,133
- When she first came out,

990
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,400
I thought maybe she had a little
Yorkie on her head.

991
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,934
The hair was very confusing
to me.

992
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,100
- So, now, Chloe, are you saying
you're a Yorkie lover?

993
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,467
Is that what you're saying?

994
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,133
- I actually don't like animals.

995
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,166
[laughter]

996
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,066
- I love the way you look.

997
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,467
Know what I loved most of all?

998
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,300
Your smile, honey.

999
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,800
You lit up tonight.

1000
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
- On the broadcast,

1001
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
you did put a lot of thought
into it.

1002
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,300
Almost too much.

1003
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,333
You got so into

1004
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:32,066
trying so hard
to memorize and memorize

1005
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,333
that you forgot to be you.

1006
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,567
- There seems to be something
blocking you

1007
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,066
from completely blooming
in this competition.

1008
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,800
- After thinking everything over
last night,

1009
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,934
I feel like I lifted something
from myself.

1010
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,133
And I'm ready to work.

1011
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:47,066
I'm ready to show you
who Stacy is.

1012
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:50,567
- Well, you said that last week,
Stacy.

1013
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,066
Thank you, ladies.

1014
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,467
While you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,

1015
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:58,066
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1016
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,133
Thank you, ladies.

1017
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,133
You may leave the stage.

1018
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,066
All right, just between us
gar-girls,

1019
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,800
what do you think?

1020
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,066
Let's start with Manila.

1021
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,767
- The makeup to me
was a little heavy.

1022
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,800
- Yes, the makeup was heavy,
but I don't know.

1023
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,266
There's just something
about Manila tonight

1024
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:14,967
that was a win-win situation
for me.

1025
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,300
- I love Manila,
because I agree she's fearless,

1026
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
and she's an equal opportunity
offender.

1027
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,667
That doesn't mean you're racist.

1028
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,700
You hate everybody,
including your own race.

1029
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,834
Then it's funny.

1030
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,333
- 'Cause if you can't
hate yourself,

1031
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,867
how in the hell you gonna
hate anybody else?

1032
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,367
- I say it all the time.

1033
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,533
- All right, up next...

1034
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:30,900
Shangela.

1035
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,667
This is a tough one, 'cause she
did a really good job too.

1036
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,734
- She impressed me, you know,
in all aspects.

1037
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,767
And I think her personality
really showed through.

1038
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,567
- I wasn't 100% sold
on the dress this evening,

1039
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:41,934
but I loved the character.

1040
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,667
She did a great job with it.

1041
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,567
- Her personality
jumped through the television

1042
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:49,300
and just tugged at your heart.

1043
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,900
I just--I really--I wanted to go
have lunch with her.

1044
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,767
- India Ferrah.

1045
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:55,667
- It was hard to watch.
- It was hard to watch.

1046
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:56,667
- Yeah. I feel for the girl,

1047
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,967
but I wasn't impressed.

1048
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,734
- She has the gift of us telling
her exactly what to do.

1049
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:04,166
And she's still not doing it.

1050
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,266
- Good point.

1051
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,533
- I thought the dress
was horrible.

1052
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,200
I thought the performance
was horrible.

1053
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,700
I thought the makeup
was horrible.

1054
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,467
This is $75,000
and a huge title.

1055
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:12,500
- Yes, absolutely.

1056
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,533
Mariah.

1057
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:14,700
Listen, I gotta admit,

1058
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,367
her performances do leave me
a little flat.

1059
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,600
- She looked like
a professional journalist,

1060
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,867
but acted like it was
a school project in ATL.

1061
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,834
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

1062
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,266
Every time she gets up here,

1063
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:30,967
she's saying, "I'm gonna start
bein' me tomorrow!"

1064
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,300
Chloe, do you believe her?

1065
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,800
- Not if she keeps saying it.

1066
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
- And she keeps saying it.

1067
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,066
- Watching the newscaster,

1068
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,500
I did not see anything
spectacular brought to it.

1069
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
Did not see a character.

1070
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,433
- Maybe that's her idea
of how bland newscasters are.

1071
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,567
- It could be.

1072
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,333
- And how boring a job
that would be.

1073
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,100
Because she did look like a
woman walking at the mall.

1074
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,333
- She looked like just a lady

1075
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,667
on the number 110 bus uptown,
to me.

1076
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,066
- The first thing I thought was,

1077
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,767
"That looks like the newscaster
in Tupelo, Mississippi."

1078
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:03,800
- It's true.

1079
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,700
- All right, silence!

1080
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,767
I've made my decision.

1081
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,433
Bring back the girls.

1082
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:16,500
- Welcome back, ladies.

1083
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,967
Based on your live
morning newscast

1084
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,300
and your presentation
on the main stage,

1085
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,400
I've made some decisions.

1086
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,533
Manila Luzon.

1087
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:30,767
This week,
you broke all the rules.

1088
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,467
You crossed the line
of good taste.

1089
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,633
And you perpetuated stereotypes.

1090
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,200
Congratulations,

1091
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,834
you're the winner
of this challenge.

1092

[applause]

1093
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:50,567
Not only are you safe
from next week's elimination,

1094
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:56,100
but you also win a $2,000
gift certificate from Wig USA.

1095
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,100
- I'm really excited
that I won this challenge.

1096
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,066
I'm proud of myself.

1097
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:10,967
- Shangela,
keep up the good work.

1098
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:12,300
You're safe.

1099
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,900
- Thank you.

1100
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,100
- India Ferrah...

1101
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,867
as Khloe Kardashian once said,

1102
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:21,667
"You can lead a horse to water,

1103
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,934
but a pencil must be lead."

1104
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:29,066
India, I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.

1105
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,467
- I am disappointed that I'm
in the bottom two again.

1106
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,967
But, you know,
I came here to do a job,

1107
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,433
and that was to prove to

1108
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,166
everyone that told me
that I couldn't do it

1109
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,667
that I can do it.

1110
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:41,567
- Mariah, listen to me, girl.

1111
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,300
You are resting on pretty.

1112
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,900
And while you rest,

1113
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,266
the other girls are gonna
race right past you.

1114
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:52,834
You're safe.

1115
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,633
- [whispering]
Thank you.

1116
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,367
Good luck.

1117
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,900
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

1118
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,600
Your brilliance
comes in flashes,

1119
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,934
but those moments
are too few and far between.

1120
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:12,400
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1121
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,500
- I do not want to go home.

1122
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,834
There ain't shit
in North Carolina

1123
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:17,834
but cornfields, honey.

1124
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,934
Two queens stand before me.

1125
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,100
Ladies, this is your last chance

1126
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,000
to impress me
and to save yourself...

1127
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,533
from elimination.

1128
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:34,500
The time has come
for you to lipsync...

1129
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,934
for your life.

1130
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,633
Good luck.

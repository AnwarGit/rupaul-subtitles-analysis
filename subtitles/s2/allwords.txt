- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Transform these silver daddies
into your drag mamas.
Steven,
you're the mother of Raven.
- She thinks she's being cunty
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard?
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."
[laughter]
- I can tell
she's getting tired,
so I grab her
and take her to the back.
[cheers and applause]
- Raven, congratulations.
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Two queens stand before me.
Jujubee.
Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, sashay away.
And tonight...
[feigning tears] I'd to thank
all the members of the Academy,
my personal tucker.
The queens hit the red carpet.
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.
- I think I did my job.
- Who will be the biggest diva?
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[all gasping]
- Thank you.
- With extra special guest
judges,
Marissa Jaret Winokur
and Tatum O'Neal.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX Cosmetics
and be the face

[engines revving]
- Oh, my God, it is so empty.
- I know.
- Wow.
- We're down to the final four.
You definitely feel the lack of
other contestants in the room.
- "Lick this Boxx..."
- "Bitch."
- How do you guys feel about me
being in the bottom
last night with Pandora?
Did I deserve to go home?
- Off of just the lip-sync,
I thought
they were gonna choose Pandora.
- But what was
the reason behind that?
- My eyes were going to Pandora.
- I don't look at Pandora
and see a star.
I look at you, and I see a star.
- I think her runway
should have put her
in the bottom two
a long time ago.
- Yes.
- She never, like,
sparkled to me.
- Who cares who Raven
thinks is a star?
I sure don't.
I'm sure she thinks
that she is a star.
And I sure don't.
- I mean, lookit.
This thing
was packed full of shit
and people all up on it.
And now there's four of us here.
I really miss my friends,
though.
- I would talk to my drag mother
every day at, like, 10:00.
- Do you talk
to your drag mother
more than your real mother?
- I don't talk
to my real mother at all.
- You don't?
- No, girl.
She abandoned me.
- My father died when I was 15.
Six months later,
my mother found somebody else,
and she left me to take care of
my two younger sisters
and to just grow up by myself,
and...I just stopped
being a kid.
I just want to thank my mother,
Charisma Jeneva Jackson Taye.
[siren]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Hey, dolls, if you still think
Liza robbed Diana
of the Oscar in 1972;
if you look in the mirror
every morning and cry out,
"You like me!
You really like me!"
then maybe, just maybe,
you could be America's
next drag superstar.
[car engine racing]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Good morning.
- Well, well, well.
You're the fantastic final four.
And you know
the next drag superstar
must possess a unique style,
and she wouldn't be caught dead
wearing the same dress
as another diva.
For today's mini-challenge,
you'll be given
identical outfits
and 30 minutes
to style and accessorize them
in a way to make them your own.
After that, I'll return to
decide which queen wore it best.
No cutting or gluing allowed.
- Oh, God.
- Ladies, make it fabulous
and make it your own.
I'll see you later.
30 minutes.
- Work.
<i>Trabaja.</i>
- Come on, Twila.
It's you and me.
- Are these dresses
all the same size?
I don't even think your tits
can even fit in here.
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.
- I'm gonna wear this hair.
- I gotta put
some lipstick on, at least.
- I look over and I see Juju
buffing makeup over her stubble.
[laughter]
- You guys laughing?
- Girl, we have on fuckin' wigs.
- [laughing]
And not a stitch of makeup.
- I put some makeup on.
Girl, look at me.
- Ew! You better put lashes on,
you dirty whore.
- I don't need no makeup.
I got fish face.
I'm daytime. I'm real.
- Yeah, girl,
you look like trout, okay?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Did En Vogue
get back together?
- Yeah!
- You girls work fast.
Look at you.
I can't believe
you got up in full drag.
- Mama.
- And she's
padded and everything.
You've got the leggings on.
Tell me about your decision
to do leggings with this.
- You know what it was?
I didn't have time to really
hide the pad lines,
and I wanted to kind of go
a little bit more R&amp;B with it.
- It does elongate you.
Now, Raven, you chose
all black accessories.
You look like a spy.
Are you a spy, girl?
- I was just going for a
little dark sophistication,
with a little hint
of last year's Rihanna.
- And you went
for scrunch boots.
- Yeah, well,
they came all the way up,
so I pushed them down.
- I've never been
a fan of the scrunch boots,
unless the lady has legs
as long as mine are, you know.
Now, Tatianna, are those
two holes in your ears?
- I have two holes,
so I thought,
why not match it up?
- Tell me about
your silver shoes.
- Well, I didn't want
to do a black shoe,
and I thought,
why not do a silver pump?
Give a little bit
of sparkle down south.
- I think that maybe Tatianna
over-accessorized.
She looks like
a 99 cent store mess.
- All right, now, miss Tyra,
you made yourself a clutch.
- Yeah, I didn't have one.
- Uh-huh, and you decided
to go the classy lady--
ladies who lunch.
From the funeral to the wake
to the after party
and then on to the club.
- And then to pick up
the children to go home.
- And then to pick up
the children.
It's a very elegant look
that any lady
at home watching
would feel very comfortable in.
- Thank you.
- All right, ladies,
the queen who wore it best is...
Tyra.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Ladies, exciting news.
For your main challenge,
you've all been nominated for
the First Annual Diva Awards!
[all scream]
Yes! Yes!
Now, the Diva Awards
are your chance
to show some serious
awards show realness.
You'll need to pull together
three different outfits
for three different
Diva Award ceremonies.
First up, the Teen Diva Awards,
where you must dress
as a hot teen queen...
using clothes provided by
the House of Infinite Radness.
Then it's the Diva
D.C. Press Awards,
where you'll be serving
some executive realness,
Washington, D.C., Style.
And finally, the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza Awards,
where you'll be expected
to gag us
with your glamour and eleganza.
I'll be back later
to see how your pre-show
preparations are going.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Go!
[laughing]
- The first thing I saw
was lime green fur.
So I grabbed
every piece of fur that I saw.
- It's nerve-wracking,
because you don't know what the
others are gonna pull out.
Now, in this competition,
it's getting to,
they're looking for the best.
You don't know
what each person is gonna do.
Our challenge this week is
to create three different looks
at the Diva Awards.
A hot, teen look
for the Teen Diva Awards.
Executive realness
for the D.C. Diva Press Awards.
And a glamorous red carpet look
for the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza.
- I had something like this
in high school, actually.
- Me too.
- [laughing]
- I felt like the biggest fag.
- Oh, you wore it as a boy?
- I didn't go to school
as a girl, Tatianna.
- [laughing]
- Okay?
Tatianna is stuck
in that realm of, "I am a girl."
I think, as a drag queen,
you should culture yourself.
Maybe I'll go all, like,
Mary Kate on everybody
and just wear 30 things at once.
You should be a chameleon.
If I lose to you...
I'll be fine.
- I want to win this challenge.
- Girl, I want
to win<i> a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> challenge.</i>
We have to be number one
and number two.
- Them winning is not an option.
- I think that Juju and I
will both help each other out
as much as we can
to make sure
that we make it to the top.
- Is this Hollywood elegance?
- I think so.
- RuPaul keeps repeating,
"Charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent."
I think I have that.
I think Raven has that.
I know the other girls carry
some of those traits,
but I don't think
they have the full package.
-<i> ♪ I don't care ♪</i>
<i>♪</i><span style="bodyStyle"> If DJ love the way ♪</i>
<i>♪ I lose my inhibitions ♪</i>
[mumbling]
[falsetto]
<i>♪ Ahh ♪</i>
- Keep on singing, girl.
- I'm sorry.
- No, do it.
You have a beautiful voice.
God gave you a gift, so use it.
[both chuckling]
- Over there trying to read.
- What do you feel about
missing Jeremiah's first day?
- I'm sad
that I'm gonna miss it.
I'm praying that his mom
takes pictures.
My son is starting
preschool today,
and I'm missing out
on his first day of school.
So I'm really gonna, like--
I'm, like, sad about it.
It's been nine weeks
since I've seen my son.
It's just driving me crazy.
I miss Jeremiah so much.
But I know that me being here
and getting a chance
to give him a better life
is all worth it.
Yes. You better do it, Tyra.
Mm-hmm.
- I sat and thought
for a majority of the morning,
thinking of the silhouette
I wanted to work with,
how I was going to utilize
the fabric that I ended up with.
[sewing machine whirring]
You never waste
your time thinking.
- Do I have feathers
all over my face?
'Cause they're
all over the floor.
- I can feel it.
- Sorry, but I want
to be fabulous.
- I just see fuzz flying
all over the fuckin' room.
And I'm like,
"what the fuck Is this?"
Tyra looks like she skinned
all of the Muppets
and is making a gown out of fur.
- I don't know
what the deal with her is.
I don't if she's
just playing a game.
Maybe she's just making this
just to kind of throw us off.
- Fabulous, darling.
Fabulous.
- I've never made
a gown like that before.
It's gonna have
more of a complicated,
more expensive look,
but it's really only, like,
three pieces of fabric
and some hot glue.
- Hello, divas!
- all: Hi.
- Oh, wow, look at this.
You're all busy at work here.
- You better work.
- Yes, mama.
Hey, Tyra.
- Hey, Ru.
- Look at you down there.
Now, which one
of the awards shows is that for?
- Elegant evening gowns.
So I want to be in a gown,
but I want it to stand out.
- Do you feel
that you're the one to beat?
Do you feel that confident?
- I do feel that confident.
I've been challenging myself
and making myself better.
- Yeah,
I've got to mention this.
Now, you're here,
and the fur is flying around,
and it's itching your face.
Now, that may be a red flag
for how it will perform
on the red carpet.
You see what I'm saying?
You might need to vacuum it
before you wear it.
- [laughing]
- Thank you, Tyra.
- Are you ready
for the biggest night
of your psychological life?
- It is pretty psychological.
- It's very psychological.
- So I see three
different ladies over there.
- I'm debating on my executive.
- Uh-huh.
- Most likely, I'm gonna
be going with this one.
- What says D.C. Diplomat
Press Awards to you?
- To me,
it just kind of reminds me
of something
that Sarah Palin would wear.
- 'Cause Sarah Palin
is your idol, and you--
- Oh, yes, I love her.
- Really?
- Please.
[both laughing]
- Everything that you've
learned about drag,
about yourself
up until this moment,
you have to put
into this challenge.
This is the big one,
and you gotta bring it.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jujubee.
- Hi, mama.
- Wow, what do you
got going on here?
Is this
for your Hollywood eleganza?
- Yes.
- It still seems
a little understated here.
What are you planning to do
to Juju it up?
- You just said it.
I'm just gonna Juju it up.
- Uh-huh.
Last week, you did wind up
in the bottom two,
and the stakes are oh, so high.
- I know.
- Well, listen,
you keep on working it, mama.
Stay down. Stay down.
Stay hood.
- Stay here.
- Stay here, that's right.
All right.
Hey, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- I see you over here
pondering your outfits here.
- Yes.
- What are we looking at?
This is your teen outfit.
- No.
- What is it?
- That is for
the Hollywood red carpet.
- Extravaganza.
I'm just a little worried
about the cha-cha of this here.
What do you think Santino
will say about this?
- I've never done anything
like that before.
- That's not an excuse, is it?
You never--just because you
haven't done it, doesn't mean--
- Well, they haven't seen it,
so they haven't
commented on anything.
- Look, Tatianna,
we're at that place.
You gotta bring it.
You're under double scrutiny.
Triple scrutiny.
- Yeah.
- Because you have three
different looks
and three different
opportunities to be criticized.
- See, I think of it
as the positive:
You have three different chances
to wow the judges
rather than just one.
- Well, listen, I don't want
to throw you off your game,
but I'm telling you, these
bitches are coming for you.
- Yeah.
- If you were ever gonna pull
something out of your ass,
now would be the time to do it.
Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Ladies, gather round.
Tomorrow, at the Diva Awards,
our extra-special guest judges
will be Tony Award-winner
Marissa Jaret Winokur
from<i> Hairspray.</i>
That's right.
And Oscar-winner Tatum O'Neal.
- [gasps]
- Yes, we have people who have
snatched trophies hunting.
- We're having a Tony Award
winner and an Oscar winner
sitting there judging us
on how we maintain ourself
at an awards ceremony.
It's no joke.
- Now, listen, I know you have
a lot on your plate.
But there's just one more
little twist, Tina, darling.
Now, before you hit
the awards show circuit,
the four of you
will need to perform
a Diva Awards opening number.
The song and outfits
have been chosen,
but you need to work together
on the choreography.
Now, Tyra, because you
won the mini challenge,
I'm leaving you in charge
of the opening number.
- I'm in charge of the girls?
- You're in charge
of the opening number.
- Hi, mama.
- Working in a group
wouldn't be my first choice,
but I'm gonna work hard,
'cause there's no way in hell
that I'm gonna let
someone else fail
and put me in the bottom two.
- Now, tomorrow
on the main stage,
I expect you girls to be
dripping with charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
[feigning tears]
And finally,
I'd like to thank
all the members of the Academy,
my personal tucker,
and last, but not least,
to my four little darling divas.
I just want to say,
don't fuck it up.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
Good-bye. Good luck.
- Bye, Ru.
- And keep it real.
- What song is it?
- I don't know.
- The last time Tyra
had to work in a group,
she wanted to leave her group.
It's a recipe for disaster.
- I thought it was my name
for a minute.
- The four of us
have to do a number
for the opening
of the Diva Awards.
Am I happy about it? No.
'Cause it takes time away from
me getting my shit together.
- So we're gonna--
okay, so we're gonna
walk out to the intro
and stand by our letter
like you are?
Right to the side of it?
- Do you want us to all
have the same pose,
or do you want us
to all have different poses,
but we just
don't break those poses
until it gets to our line?
- Um...
- So we look at Tyra,
and we're trying to figure out
what the direction is for this.
And she's not really giving
anything,
and then she does,
and we're like...okay...
- We walk out.
When does this happen?
- At the beginning.
- When what happens?
- Right at the beginning?
- This is the end.
- Oh, this is the end.
- I think it showed that Tyra
isn't the best
with choreography,
because there
wasn't choreography.
It was just kind of,
"We're gonna pose
and then we're gonna spin
"and then we're gonna pose.
And then we're gonna
stack letters and pose."
And it was very posey.
- Who's singing this part?
- We'll figure it out later.
- I'm the one with the attitude.
- Oh, I guess
I'll just stay here.
- Our rehearsal was a hot mess.
And so I'm really hoping that we
can pull this off tomorrow.
Thank you.
[alarm beeps]
- Just me.
- You are so shady.
- Bitch, please.
- Is everybody confident with
the things that they have?
- Yeah, I couldn't
sleep last night, though.
I was sitting there thinking,
what the hell?
I wasn't happy with my teen
dream whatever.
- I hope this shirt fits me.
- I'm so scared
about this dress.
I wanted to make a full gown,
completely made out of fur.
But I realize
that I don't like it,
so now I have to change my
entire plans
and come up with a new look.
- So today
determines the top three,
and I'm gonna be there.
- I definitely think
that I deserve to be here.
I think I work very, very hard.
- I know I deserve to.
I worked really hard,
and I've grown a lot
since I've been here.
And I think
that they know it too.
- You know, I may have had
to lip-synch for my life twice,
but it got to the point where
the challenges got harder,
and I won two of them.
- Y'all won two.
You won two.
You got one.
And I have zero.
I do not want to be
in the bottom two again.
You know, this is gonna be
a third time, if I do.
And last I remember,
Sahara did it three times,
and she went home.
- Now, who do you think's
gonna be in the top three?
- Me.
- Me.
- Name all three people.
- Why don't you start then?
- Okay, I think it's gonna be
me, you and Tyra.
Tyra has shown consistency.
You have brought
a sense of energy.
I have given them
what they are looking for.
And it seems like Tatianna
hasn't done
what they want from her yet.
So, Tatianna, who do you think
is in the top three?
- Um, I hope it's me.
And that's really all
I have to say on the matter.
- Tyra.
- I would have
to agree with you.
But things could change
if she pulls it together today.
I think she, like, would,
like, have to really,
like, wow the judges.
- Jujubee.
- You know, I--I hate
to be like this,
but Tatianna, don't hate me.
- All right.
- But I have to agree
with you, Raven.
Don't be mad at me, girl.
- I've known for a while
that all the girls
don't think I'm competition.
But a lot of those girls who
thought I wasn't competition
have gone home.
In my head, I'm just like...
think that, feel that, own it.
Whatever.
You're not
gonna break my spirit.
- You know I only bring shit up
that I absolutely have to.
- You're such a bitch.
I love it.
[giggles]
[RuPaul laughing]
[applause]
- Hey, judges.
Santino Rice.
Why, you old geezer.
- [laughing]
- Merle, hi, honey.
- Honey,
I don't have to tell you
to gather ye rosebuds
while ye may tonight.
- [laughs]
Marissa!
- Hello.
Your hair is amazing.
- Oh, you know,
I just washed it;
I couldn't do a thing with it.
Tatum O'Neal is here.
So happy to have you.
- Thank you.
- Are you ready to see my girls?
- Hell, yeah.
- Excellent.
This week,
our ladies were challenged
to pull off three
award-winning looks.
Now, to kick things off,
our ladies have prepared
a show-stopping opening number.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best<i> woman</i><span style="bodyStyle"> win!</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,
here come our girls
for the Teen Diva Awards.
Tatianna.
Oh, my God, you guys,
she's so cute.
- Is that from, like, BCBG?
- I'm feeling
like I'm selling it,
and I'm really giving
the aura of hot teen actress.
- Bye.
Oh, my God, that is so Raven.
- That's like teen Chanel.
- It is teen Chanel.
- I feel cute, I feel fun.
I'm just bouncing
down the catwalk.
- I really want
to lose three pounds, Raven.
Yes.
- [laughing]
- Jujubee.
- She's a mean girl.
- Oh, is this the B.E.T.
Teen Awards?
She must be from Baldwin hills.
[laughter]
- I'm so comfortable with this
hip-hop look right now.
I am channeling
miss Mary J. Blige.
- Yeah, MJB, y'all.
Ooh!
[gasps]
Is that Solange Knowles?
No, honey, it is Tyra.
- I felt as if I had turned 16
all over again.
- Oh, my God, Tyra,
you were supposed to text me.
Breaking news.
Let's go live
to the D.C. Diva Press Awards.
Sarah Palin!
She can see Russia
from her house.
I'm feeling super confident.
It's a look that I've
never tried before.
But I still felt sexy.
- Oh, she's got a call.
Hello? Rush Limbaugh?
Why, you fat fuck!
[laughter]
- Oh...Leslie Stahl, yes.
Right?
Well, she's giving
a speaker of the house.
- I'm just gonna give power.
I'm getting an award
for taking care of business.
- Meet you at the Watergate
for lunch.
Jujubee.
Is she a lawyer?
- I think she's getting a call
from the husband.
- He's saying,
"Stop buying all that ESCADA.
It's costing me too much money."
- I'm kind of channeling
a fierce executive.
She refuses to wear skirts.
She wears the pants
in the family.
- She's very Nancy Pelosi.
But, see,
she can move her forehead.
And her ass.
Mary J. Pelosi.
[laughter]
Tyra Sanchez.
Eat your heart out,
Michelle Obama.
- The judges have never seen me
in pants.
And so it's giving them
a different look for me.
But still Tyra--
nice and elegant,
but totally different look.
- Yes, she can.
- I'm James St. James,
author, nightlife dinosaur,
and red carpet perennial,
here at the Diva Awards.
- Here's a young starlet,
Tatianna.
- Come here, come here.
Now tell me what it is
that you're wearing.
- I wanted to show some leg,
but I wanted to still be cute
and not too--too much.
- Gorgeous.
Do you think
she's wearing panties?
- No.
- No Hollywood starlet does.
- [laughs]
- [gasps]
Is that Cher?
Oh, my God, that is Raven.
- You are the spitting image
of Anjelica Huston!
What is it you're wearing?
Give us the ensemble.
- The gown is by Vivian Wallace.
I lost a few beads,
but hopefully they'll end up
on the runaway,
and a couple of the girls
will fall on them.
- That beading is gorgeous.
I want that outfit.
It's very Angelina Jolie, right?
- Without the children.
- Yes, without the kids
or the Mickey D's.
What Bollywood star is this?
[gasps]
Jujubee.
- I feel wonderful, fabulous,
gorgeous, beautiful!
- Keep it coming,
keep it coming.
- You look gorgeous.
You know that.
- [gasps]
Oh!
She's not just dressed
for the red carpet.
She's wearing it.
- Who's--is that Beyonce?
- No. [gasps]
Oh, my goodness, it's Tyra.
- My dear,
how are you feeling tonight?
Are you having a good time?
- I'm feeling fabulous.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to your fans?
- To my fans,
just keep dreaming,
and remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love anybody else?
- Tyra. Ohh.
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.
- It's very Rita Hayworth.
<i>Gilda.</i>
- Yes,<i> Gilda!</i>
- Welcome, ladies.
An acceptance speech
is an essential part
of any awards show.
And now, I want each of you
to share yours with the judges.
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
Tatianna.
- First off, thank you.
I want to start
by thanking my mother.
Without her,
I wouldn't be here today,
and without her genes,
I might not
have been here today.
I did me to the fullest.
And that is why I'm standing
here today accepting this award.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...Raven.
- Oh!
[laughter]
[sniffling]
Thank you so much.
I, first of all,
have to thank God,
for without Him,
I would not be here.
I also have to thank RuPaul
for putting a fire
under my butt.
And I also have to thank
all of my fans
who have gotten me
to where I am today.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Raven.
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[drum roll]
Jujubee.
- [hyperventilating]
Thank you so much.
First and foremost,
I'd like to thank my Creator,
King Jesus and God Himself.
I'd like to thank my father
for just believing in me
and taking his time to teach me.
Mother, I know you're out there,
and I know you're watching.
It's okay.
One day, we'll be
back together again.
This is my diva moment,
and I am so glad
to share this moment with you.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[drum roll]
Tyra Sanchez.
- Wow, I didn't even know
I was nominated.
[laughter]
First and foremost,
I have to dedicate my award
to my son.
It's you who make me smile.
It's you who keeps me going.
It's you who makes me motivated.
And I just want him to know
that if he believes,
all dreams will come true.
[whispers]
Thank you.
[feigning tears] I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.
[laughter]
[applause]
All right, now it's time
for the judges' critique.
Tatianna,
I want to start with you.
- Hello.
- Did you intentionally
do Sarah Palin?
- No, I wasn't intentionally
going for that,
but I do love her hair.
- Interestingly enough,
I think the sexiest
we've seen you look
was doing
the executive chic in D.C.
The fact that you're
hiding it a little
made you look more beautiful.
- I'm not in love
with the ruffle.
It's a little too big on top.
It's not coming off as,
like, a real garment for me.
- The red carpet, now,
that's where you got me.
Unfortunately, James St. James,
he's been holding a mic
a long time.
Or we don't know what he's
been holding, but what...
- [laughing]
Among other things.
- Among other things.
But he really got into that mic,
and he was like,
"So, what do you think?"
and you were like, "Well..."
- It did seem like you were
soft-spoken
and was lacking confidence.
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.
- I have to say
I really do love this dress.
- It's actually sheer.
The beads cover your...
naughty parts.
- When you wear it,
you're of course
supposed to be a<i> real</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman.</i>
- Oh, you mean
for a biological woman.
- [laughing]
A biological woman.
I'm a psychological woman.
- Oh, okay.
[laughter]
- But...
- You were giving me the first
woman four-star general.
It was very severe
and believable,
and I--I love that.
- I love it--a four-star general
with a pearl necklace.
- Yeah. [laughing]
- That's hot.
- Your backstage was, I think,
the best
out of the girls for me.
You were accessible,
you were funny.
- There are no small people,
just big bitches.
- Funny as that was,
then you turned around
and gave an acceptance speech
that was completely
from the heart.
So we got to see all the
different spectrum of you,
which we saw
in all the outfits too.
- Thank you.
- Jujubee.
- Hi.
- Your Diva Awards presentation.
You missed a few steps.
- Of course, you know, I--
I have two left feet.
- I was like,
"Oh, no, she's messing up."
But then you, like,
camped it up so much
that then I kind of couldn't
keep my eyes off of you.
You really recovered well.
And then this look, I did think,
"Oh, this is a costume.
"This isn't what someone
would really wear
to an awards ceremony."
- I thought what Juju
brought tonight
was nerve.
I thought it was very nervy.
to go with a hip-hop,
urban look
when it's not
what you would expect.
It was really
the only true surprise
that we saw.
- Then we got
your acceptance speech.
- Mother,
I know you're out there,
and I know you're watching.
It's okay.
One day,
we'll be back together again.
We all know I don't have
a relationship with my mother.
But she put me here on earth,
so I have to thank her.
- I can relate.
My dad wasn't there, uh,
for my, uh,
winning the Academy Award.
So--but he was busy and stuff,
so it's not like I
hold it against him.
But, so, but you know, you'd--
I was eight years old,
so you'd want someone there.
So I get it,
you know what I mean?
And--but I love that you had the
presence of mind to say that.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Tyra.
- Hi.
- I've gotta tell you,
the fact that you've been here
all these weeks,
and you were able
to save this dress till now--
I just want to give you a
standing ovation for that alone.
- Thank you.
- Were there any other times
when you thought,
"Okay, I'm gonna wear
the ice green today?"
- Every time I would get ready
for a challenge,
I would see it,
and I'm thinking,
"It's not time; when it's time,
it'll call my name."
[laughter]
- And you're just
so impressive this week.
I love that plum cocktail dress.
I notice that you
covered the shoes.
You know, you just know
how to wear clothes.
- That was my favorite teen
outfit.
That dress was exactly right.
And then the hair
was so very editorial.
- Your acceptance speech,
it was,
I think, my favorite tonight.
I have seen a lot of growth
in your stage presence.
Your confidence, your calmness,
the way you spoke
was really there.
- Well, thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starts]
- All right,
here comes the hard part.
Let's start with Tatianna.
There's something about Tatianna
that feels unfinished,
like her dress.
Here's the thing:
when you've got a body
like Tatianna,
you don't have to do much.
If you're asked to bring
red carpet realness,
don't come in something
that's a little too slutty,
a little too obvious--
and homemade.
- But there was a positive about
her Washington, D.C., look.
- I thought that was
her best look,
because she wasn't
leaning on her looks.
She was bringing something else
to the table--
some thought and some fun.
- I think she has a spark.
Even her just
standing there smiling,
like, my eyes are drawn to her.
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, there's no question
why she made it this far.
- She's gorgeous.
- Yes, she is gorgeous.
- But you've got people
who are dropping into character,
who are like, you know,
have got some,
like, really good,
off-the-cuff repartee,
so it isn't just
about a beautiful face.
- The real question is,
does Tatianna have what it takes
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- She got the beauty,
she got the body;
I don't believe
she has the personality
or the taste level
or the sassy humor.
- Let's go to Jujubee.
You know, Jujubee has this
intellect about her
that feels beyond
any of the girls in the room.
But she sometimes
relies on this sort of
"I perform for you"
type of character
that is sort of one-dimensional.
- No, I totally disagree.
I think she's an actress.
She's got some spunk about her.
Her minus: I think she made
a poor choice on her last dress.
I don't know if that's worth
being sent home for.
- Raven.
- I just was drawn to her,
just because she
seemed like somebody
who's worked very hard, who's--
who sort of gets it,
who is funny.
- Well, I've gotten to be a
bigger fan of Raven's
as the show's gone on.
Every week, the onion peels back
a little more.
- Yeah.
- And what you see
gets more interesting.
- It's so tough, 'cause I--
I mean, the same thing
that I love about Raven
is the thing
that could be her weakness,
and it's that hard edge.
- All right, now, Tyra.
- I loved her from the minute
that she walked on.
She just got me, man.
Like, I just really
looked at her,
and I was like, "Star, winner."
She does need
to work on her voice.
- She's gotten better,
and the speech she gave tonight
was funnier and softer than
anything else she's delivered.
- That's true.
I've never changed my voice.
I think people
hear me differently
when I'm in drag.
But I've never change my voice.
Never have.
- You have a very--
you know,
your voice matches you.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- He's 21.
I can't imagine going through...
this at 21.
And with a son, to say,
"I'm gonna do this"?
I think that shows more maturity
than anybody else on that stage,
being able to say,
"I have a child,
"I'm bringing him into this
amazing world
"and showing him
you can really do--
this is truly proving
you can do whatever you want."
All right, silence!
I have made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, awards are a funny thing.
We lie and say it's an honor
just to be nominated.
But deep down, we all want
to snatch that trophy.
And yet,
what matters in this world
is charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Based on that criteria,
I've made some decisions.
Raven...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may leave the stage.
- Thank you.
- I'm top three.
I'm excited.
But I should have won.
- The winner of this week's
challenge is...
Tyra Sanchez.
[applause]
Congratulations.
You have won a feature photo
spread in<i> Paper</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
You may leave the stage.
- I'm not satisfied
being in the top three.
My goal is to win.
- Jujubee...
Tatianna...
the two of you
are up for elimination.
- Once again,
I'm in the bottom two.
I'm so disappointed.
- When I hear
that I'm in the bottom two,
I'm not surprised.
I'm really just trying
to pull this out.
- Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.

[applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Jujubee...
Shante, you stay.
- [whispers]
Thank you.
I am in the final three.
Girl!
I was just like this,
like, gay boy with a dream.
You know?
- Tatianna...
you made this competition
fun and fresh and young.
And we all owe you
a debt of gratitude.
For that, I have just two words.
[tearful]
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Now sashay away.
- Bye.
[applause]
And look at my skirt.
It's short as hell.
[laughter]
Ha ha!
[laughing]
Bye.
You know, to the people who said
that I wasn't drag enough,
just because
I have natural beauty
doesn't mean
I'm not a drag queen.
I didn't have to put on pounds
of makeup to be pretty.
I think that bothered
some people here,
but that's their issue.
I know what I've got.
I know that I am a drag queen,
and one of the top drag queens,
thank you very much.
- And then there were three.
We are fast approaching
the finish line
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tyra, Jujubee, Raven.
Next week, one of you will be
crowned the next drag superstar.
Until then, remember:
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Reading is fundamental.
- My new book is going
to hit stores soon.
It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>
- Tatianna, thank you
for being here.
- Thank you, and let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Uh, good luck.
- Fuck.
- I'm a little worried
about your confidence level.
- If you're gonna look
like a coke whore,
take the joke even further.
- Raven, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Two queens stand before me.
Tatianna, shantay you stay.
- Are you playing with me?
- Jessica, sashay away.
- Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"
<i>The dolls get a challenge</i>
<i>for the ages.</i>
- Whoa, Jesus.
- I've got a safety pin.
I thought, like, a low cut.
-<i> And a real life lesson...</i>
- Oh, I had dreams about this.
- I think that my drag mother
hit on me.
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Cloris Leachman</i>
<i>and Debbie Reynolds</i>
<i>And NYX Cosmetics' Toni Ko.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics</i>
<i>and be the face</i>
<i>of nyxcosmetics.com;</i>
<i>an exclusive one-year</i>
<i>PR contract</i>
<i>with the leading LGBT firm,</i>
<i>Project Publicity;</i>
<i>be featured in l.a.Eyeworks'</i>
<i>legendary designer eyewear</i>
<i>campaign</i>
<i>and headline</i>
<i>Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour</i>
<i>featuring exceptional</i>
<i>Absolut drinks;</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $25,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
[alarm blaring]
-<i> [groaning]</i>
Oh, I cannot handle
your weight.
-<i> There's only five of us left.</i>
<i>Jessica was the last one to go.</i>
And it's kind of sad
because we all liked Jessica.
- Oh,<i> mira, mira!</i>
"I love you girls.
<i>Viva Puerto Rico!"</i>
I miss Jessica, but I still have
my girl Tatianna.
You know, most people here
don't agree with that situation.
- Aw, Jessica.
- I honestly thought she was
gonna be, like,
in the top three.
<i>- Me too.</i>
<i>- I thought so too.</i>
- People are upset
that Tatianna's still here.
<i>And I was shocked too.</i>
<i>I was like, "Wow,</i>
Jessica's sending Tatianna
home tonight."
- But that's not the case.
Raven loves to hear
her own voice.
- Why did you look at Ru
and go, "Really?"
- 'Cause I wasn't expecting
to be safe.
- So do you think
you shouldn't be here?
- No, I don't think
I shouldn't be here.
I just wasn't expecting
to be safe.
- But you questioned it.
- I was just pretty shocked.
[laughs]
- That lack of confidence,
that's not a superstar.
<i>Questioning yourself</i>
<i>is gonna make them go,</i>
"Okay, does she really not think
that she's that good
to be here?"
- Honestly,
I'm a little tired
of having to defend
my confidence
or my want to be here.
I could give two fucks less
what anyone has to say.
- How do you all feel
about the judges?
- Yeah, I love the judges too.
<i>I feel like I have gotten</i>
<i>some mixed messages.</i>
They want me funny,
but they want me glamorous,
but they don't,
and then they do.
He said to me, "I don't like
your style at all."
<i>Like, where do you go</i>
<i>from there?</i>
How am I ever gonna impress him
if he doesn't like my style?
[alarm sounds]
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got shemail.</i>
You know, a famous beauty
once said,
"After age 40,
a woman must choose
between her face and her ass."
Well, clearly this bitch
never met a drag queen.
Youth may be wasted
on the young,
but trust me, you want to be
the next drag superstar,
well, your future is staring
at you right in the face.
[engine roaring]
- Do we have to wear
a fat suit?
- Something about babies
and old people and...
- Maybe we're gonna go in
for surgery
to get our ovaries removed.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi!
- My babies,
look how far you've come.
<i>Today your mini challenge</i>
<i>is all about</i>
<i>your beautiful baby faces.</i>
In a moment, you'll have
to match this season's 12 queens
with their baby pictures.
The one who makes
the most matches
in the least amount of time
wins.
<i>Raven, are you ready?</i>
-<i> Yep.</i>
-<i> Ladyboy, baby boy, go!</i>
- All right. Yes.
Oh!
<i>I see a little tiny baby</i>
<i>and a big ol' Mystique face</i>
<i>on it just looking up like,</i>
"How you doin'?"
Done.
-<i> There is definitely</i>
<i>an urgency</i>
<i>with me wanting to win</i>
<i>this mini challenge</i>
<i>just because I had</i>
<i>such a rough night</i>
having to lip-sync for my life.
-<i> Every second counts.</i>
<i>And where is the Puerto Rican?</i>
- [laughing]
What the fuck is that?
- Now, you all did a great job.
<i>I want to reveal</i>
<i>the correct matches.</i>
<i>This is of course,</i>
<i>Nicole Paige Brooks.</i>
<i>Morgan McMichaels.</i>
<i>Sahara Davenport.</i>
<i>And look at this</i>
<i>little lady here.</i>
<i>Remember her?</i>
<i>- Shangela.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>
Is that my little buddy
next to her right there?
- Oh, I thought that was Chucky.
-<i> That's Sonique.</i>
<i>This little laddie, Tatianna.</i>
- Yes.
<i>all: Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- Jessica Wild.</i>
- Doing nudes as a baby.
Oh, and look here.
-<i> Aww, Jujubee.</i>
<i>- The other Tyra.</i>
<i>- The other Tyra.</i>
And this, of course,
is baby Mystique.
Now, I have to explain this.
Mystique lost all of her
family photos in a fire.
Now, Tyra, you got 12 right
in 57 seconds.
Jujubee, you only got ten right,
and it took a minute
and 33 seconds.
Pandora, you got 12 right
in a minute and 24 seconds.
<i>So Tyra's still ahead.</i>
Raven, you also got 12 right
in one minute and six seconds.
- Oh, damn.
- And, Tatianna, you got
12 right in...
51 seconds.
Congratulations.
You won the baby face
mini challenge.
Now for today's main challenge.
<i>Life goes by so quickly.</i>
Before you know it,
you're a golden girl.
This week, you're gonna get
a chance to grow old gracefully.
<i>I have some special guests</i>
<i>I want you to meet.</i>
<i>Welcome, gentlemen.</i>
Please, introduce yourselves.
- I'm Michael, a writer.
- Edward, I'm a displaced
mortgage accountant.
- Don, retired teacher
and filmmaker.
- Dustin, former
ballroom dance instructor.
- Steven May, owner
of a real estate brokerage.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
- I was just like,
"Oh, what are we doing?"
-<i> Now, we are lucky</i>
<i>to live in a time</i>
where we can be more open
and honest than ever before.
And we have these men
and their generation to thank.
<i>Now it's your chance</i>
<i>to show your gratitude</i>
by making them fabulous.
-<i> Oh, no!</i>
We are going to have to put
old men in drag.
-<i> For your main challenge,</i>
<i>you'll transform</i>
<i>these silver daddies</i>
<i>into your drag mamas.</i>
It's a NYX Cosmetics
golden girl makeover.
And, ladies, I expect to see
a definite family resemblance.
<i>In addition</i>
<i>to your NYX Cosmetics,</i>
<i>you can use your own drag</i>
plus shoes
from Le Dame Footwear
<i>and wigs courtesy</i>
<i>of Wig Pro Collection.</i>
Don't hold back, because this
is your mama we talkin' about.
<i>Tatianna, as the baby face</i>
<i>mini challenge winner,</i>
<i>you get to pick first.</i>
Take a closer look.
You can look at the teeth.
- Smile.
[laughter]
-<i> Yeah, look at all of them.</i>
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"
All right.
-<i> Of course, Tatianna goes up</i>
and picks the one
that I knew she'd pick:
the pretty one.
-<i> Tatianna, you're not done yet.</i>
Now you get to pair
the other queens
<i>with their drag mama.</i>
-<i> Oh, shit, I'm gonna get</i>
<i>one of these two bastards</i>
<i>at the end.</i>
<i>She's giving me</i>
<i>one of those two.</i>
<i>- Hi, Mama.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
- How are you?
-<i> So sweet.</i>
-<i> Juju did whisper to me</i>
<i>who she wanted,</i>
and that's my girl.
<i>Everyone else I just kind of</i>
<i>was like, "You here."</i>
- Mom!
-<i> The Boxxes.</i>
-<i> You here.</i>
-<i> Aw, isn't that sweet?</i>
<i>Dustin Sanchez.</i>
- I did consciously
leave Raven for last.
Steven, you're the mother
of Raven.
- Oh, how sweet!
- Hi, Mommy.
-<i> Aw, that's gorgeous!</i>
- Sure enough,
the last one I get,
the one with the full
fucking facial hair.
<i>I'm like, "Okay, bitch,</i>
<i>you watch.</i>
I'll turn
this motherfucker out."
- Now, I need you to show me
that charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
runs in the family.
Now, I'm gonna leave you
to have
a little mother-daughter
bonding time,
and I'll be back
a little bit later.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best "womens" win.
-<i> Do you got a walk?</i>
- I don't know how to do a walk.
- Come on, it's one, two--
- Oh, wait.
- In early gay liberation,
I did what we called skag drag.
Gender fuck.
You know, where we, like,
wear combat boots
and frilly dresses.
- I see a fierce diva
in my drag mother.
So I think that Tatianna
did a good job pairing me up.
Thank you, Tatianna.
Tss.
- This is, like,
3/4 of an inch taller,
and that's just enough to send
me into the orthopedic ward.
You know what I'm saying,
darling?
- Yes.
So Michael, um,
does have a limp.
- Whoa, Jesus.
-<i> I think</i>
<i>some of the other girls</i>
<i>might think I made</i>
<i>a bad decision choosing Michael</i>
because of his leg.
- Mm-hmm.
- But, um, who cares?
- Ouch! No way.
- Really?
- This is gonna take some work.
- Oh, man.
- I'm so excited!
The main challenge is gonna be
us turning these fabulous men
into our drag mother.
- I've got a safety pin
and I've got a spear.
I-I wear all kinds of junk
in here.
I-I put in all this stuff
for today.
- Wow.
- I thought maybe you'd do
something interesting with it,
like a low cut.
I wanted to give you
that option.
- Thank you for the option,
but we're gonna cover that up.
We're not--we're not gonna
show that off.
<i>My mother's gonna be</i>
<i>sexy conservative,</i>
fierce, confident,
and beautiful.
- I had a very interesting
experience
of being a part
of early gay liberation.
So I know what life is like
being in the closet
and out of the closet.
-<i> The point of this challenge,</i>
<i>I think,</i>
<i>is respecting your elders,</i>
respecting people
who have fought for you.
<i>At the same time, encouraging</i>
<i>and helping someone else</i>
to be as fierce as you are.
And my mother will not
be bearded.
- [laughs]
- Just don't think of, um,
the little Chihuahua
and the master.
That--no, no.
But if you want to do
master and slave,
that could work too.
If I want to be master...
- He's a little bit
of a dirty man.
- Oh, I had dreams about this.
- And I think that my
drag mother hit on me.
- It looks older
than I want to look.
No.
See, if we could get an
attractive-shaped one of these,
it would make my face
look a little thinner.
-<i> I think bigger hair</i>
<i>would make your face</i>
<i>a little thinner, though.</i>
- But didn't you see those,
though, on me?
It was just like...
- No, but you have--
just trust me.
I've been doing drag too long
to know that a flat wig
is gonna help out a big face.
- 'Cause what I was thinking--
- Were you not listening to me,
Mom?
- No!
- Just shh.
- I am a challenge.
- Michael is very theatrical.
- Because I've had a number of,
uh, injuries and health issues
that have caused my body
to look kind of beat up,
like I told you.
And that is your job,
to fix me up.
- Transforming someone older,
the face is a little bit harder
to transform.
The body may be a little bit
harder to transform.
Obviously, the skin
isn't as smooth and taut
as it is when you're younger.
- You're lucky 'cause I don't
have to shave here.
- You already take care of this?
- No, I don't have any.
- Oh, you just had it removed?
- No, it just fell out.
- Oh.
- Hello, hello, hello!
<i>Hi.</i>
Ooh, these gorgeous wigs.
How's it going out
with your new mommy?
- It's Contessa Touché.
- Contessa Touché.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow, I love that.
<i>What do you have planned</i>
<i>for your drag mother's outfit?</i>
- She wants to just look
really elegant.
- Uh-huh.
- And she doesn't want to look
too old.
- Or too fat.
-<i> Really, the only</i>
<i>challenging thing with Contessa</i>
at the moment
is her confidence level.
- All right, carry on.
Hi, Raven.
- Hello.
- Hi, Steven. How are you?
- Hi, Ru.
- Does Steven
have a drag name yet?
- It's Golda Lamé.
- Golda Lamé.
Now, now, you know that this
is your challenge.
You will be judged
on this challenge.
- Yes.
Tatianna picked me last.
She thinks she's being cunty
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard
and is a little older-looking.
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."
- All right, well, bring it.
- It's been broughten, honey T.
[laughter]
<i>My drag mother,</i>
<i>if she was a woman,</i>
would take her bra off, burn it,
never wear a high heel
in her life,
have a bush this big.
We're gonna dip her in Nair
and pull her out
and get her dressed.
- You got a lot of work to do,
so good luck.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Well, well, well.
What's going on?
- I'm already nervous
<i>because I've never done</i>
<i>anyone else's makeup.</i>
So I'm kind of scared.
I don't know how to do it,
<i>'cause I hate</i>
<i>doing my own face.</i>
- You do?
- I don't like doing makeup.
Like, I would rather sit there
and have someone do it.
- You know, you got
a lot of work cut out for you
and not a lot of time.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
<i>All right, Tatianna.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- Why did you pick Michael
as your drag mama?
- Face and eyes.
- And you got to assign
all the other queens
to their drag mothers.
- Mm-hmm.
- What was your strategy?
- I really didn't have one.
-<i> You didn't have a strategy?</i>
- I really didn't have one.
- Well, Raven believes that, uh,
you chose her drag mother
because she had a beard.
- No, I mean,
you can shave a beard.
- Because, you know,
if you had,
that would've been
really fierce.
- There was a slight strategy,
but I'm not trying
to announce it to the room.
- All right, Tatianna, who uses
no strategy as her strategy,
<i>good luck.</i>
- Thank you.
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Boxx.
- Just call me Litter.
-<i> Oh, I love that.</i>
Pandora and Litter Boxx.
- Yes.
- The umbilical cord
is still attached.
- Oh, dear!
<i>Yes, that's--that's, I think,</i>
illegal in 40 of the 50 states.
- I think it is, yes.
- Would you like to demonstrate
your walk?
- Do I have to keep
my clothes on?
- You can keep your clothes on.
- I didn't want to.
- Do it as if you were
stark naked.
Yes, show us
what you're working with.
<i>Oh, okay.</i>
Mama Litter.
Well, keep on keeping on.
See you, Miss Litter.
- See you.
-<i> All right, gather around,</i>
<i>ladies.</i>
Tomorrow,
our special guest judges
<i>will include founder and CEO</i>
of NYX cosmetics, Toni Ko,
plus two legendary
Hollywood stars--
<i>the academy award-winning</i>
<i>actress Cloris Leachman...</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Cloris is also providing you</i>
<i>with clothes</i>
from her Clorisline collection.
<i>And last but certainly</i>
<i>not least,</i>
<i>the unsinkable</i>
<i>Miss Debbie Reynolds</i>
<i>will be here.</i>
[laughter and applause]
-<i> My mother is so excited.</i>
She's like, "Oh, my God,
I love her, oh, my God!"
<i>I'm like, "Yes,</i>
<i>you see that excitement</i>
<i>"that you have for those girls?</i>
Now we need to put that
into our performance."
- Oh, and one more thing.
Tomorrow, in addition to your
fierce runway presentation,
you must perform a lip-sync duet
with your drag mother
to my song<i> Main Event.</i>
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
How much more can we do
in this one challenge?
I want to cry.
-<i> Now, good luck,</i>
<i>and as Mama used to say,</i>
"Don't fuck it up."
-<i> Your mama workin' it out?</i>
- Oh, she is. She is.
-<i> She workin' you out?</i>
- She's teaching me
a new dance.
- I just want to see.
- I wanted the blue one.
- Cloris Leachman
is providing us
<i>with her own clothing line,</i>
<i>called Clorisline.</i>
<i>And it's probably a good idea</i>
<i>to incorporate</i>
something in that
since she's a judge.
- Mama, look what I got you.
- Your homework is to shave,
shave, shave, shave.
<i>The challenge for today is,</i>
we got a group
of older gentlemen
which we are to transform
into our drag mothers.
A lot of shaving.
- I guess it grew back.
- Just a little.
[laughs]
The twist is that we have to do
a mother-daughter lip-sync.
-<i> ♪ All the drama takes</i>
<i>center stage ♪</i>
- I yelled at my mother,
and look,
she's on the couch with her
heels on learning the song.
I said, "Bitch,
you better listen
to that shit ten times."
-<i> ♪ Strike up the band ♪</i>
- It's supposed to be
a mother-daughter, right?
So I'm dividing it up
between the two of us.
-<i> I know that Michael</i>
<i>has ideas,</i>
and he's definitely
making them known,
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>when it comes down to it,</i>
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>that would be sent home,</i>
so I have to really get
my vision out there.
My style of performing is,
I don't have a plan.
- No plan?
- When I'm by myself,
I have no plan.
- I'm confused
about whose line is what.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>Um, where's mine?</i>
<i>'Cause I just wrote it down.</i>
Let me find--
Do you--
- No, not me.
- Okay.
- Tatianna's mom looks
really pissed off.
- [sighs]
- Uh-uh, more attitude.
Do the hip.
The time has come for us to do
the runway and rehearse, honey.
We only have 20 minutes.
Hold your head up high,
miss honey.
And then right up here,
we gonna stop,
flirt, kind of rub yourself
a little bit like this, right?
<i>Pretend you're Celine Dion.</i>
Do you feel sexy?
Confidence.
- Uhh...
- Without confidence,
we're Tatianna.
-<i> ♪ Disco ♪</i>
<i>♪ Leave your problems ♪</i>
<i>♪ At the front door ♪</i>
- We both have a similar idea
of what we want to do.
-<i> ♪ This is the main event ♪</i>
<i>♪ Are you ready ♪</i>
- Michael was definitely
telling me
<i>about how he used to work</i>
<i>at a disco.</i>
So he really felt a connection
to the music.
<i>I did so poorly last challenge,</i>
and I really want
to make that up to the judges
<i>and make them see</i>
<i>that they kept me for a reason.</i>
I'm happy!
- Good.
- I'm just trying
to figure out clothes.
And it's really because
they haven't liked
a lot of stuff
that I've done on the runway
that I'm like, "Okay."
Just staring at my wardrobe,
thinking,
"What the fuck
am I gonna do?"
- Is this supposed
to be incorporated
into what you're creating?
- We can, we don't have to,
but I really want it to be fun
and, like, a little
over-the-top.
We are gonna be judged on
how well we transfer my essence,
<i>the essence of Pandora.</i>
<i>So if my essence</i>
<i>is bad fashion,</i>
then my mom's gettin'
bad fashion too.
-<i> Rub it in.</i>
Like, caressing your own body
and then just shoot it
out of your fingertips.
Just really extend your fingers.
- My drag mother and I
are going to do
a little cha-cha
that she taught me,
<i>and the reason is because</i>
<i>when we're onstage,</i>
<i>the judges are going to see me</i>
<i>and my drag mother.</i>
So I want them to see a part
of my drag mother in me.
Four, um, two, three--
-<i> Oh, this is the dance.</i>
Yeah, so it was two, three,
four, and one.
See, I've changed
the choreography already.
-<i> While rehearsing</i>
<i>with my drag mother,</i>
<i>every time she would start</i>
<i>over, she would change it.</i>
I'm a little scared.
<i>I don't have much time</i>
<i>to learn,</i>
and I don't want him
to mess up either
because he'll be dancing
in heels.
We probably need
to try that again.
- Have you ever put on
panty hose before?
- No.
- Can you do a running
back handspring?
So we get out
onto the main stage
for our 20 minutes of rehearsal.
<i>My drag mom has bad eyes.</i>
So I can see her standing there
and kind of, like, looking like,
"Where are you?"
<i>as I walk out there,</i>
<i>and I know that the lights</i>
<i>are gonna be even brighter,</i>
<i>so I'm like, "This bitch</i>
is not gonna be able to see
what she's doing."
Try walking by yourself.
You're so dainty about it.
[laughter]
Stop.
Put your hand on your hip
and then turn.
- Turn.
- All the way around.
- Okay.
- And then walk back.
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, stand there.</i>
<i>"Basically you follow my lead.</i>
"Do what I do.
<i>Don't fall off the stage."</i>
<i>And just stay there, yeah.</i>
And then bring your hand down.
Put it over your heart.
<i>She needs direction.</i>
<i>Like, she needs you to say,</i>
<i>"This is where we're going.</i>
<i>"This is when we're walking.</i>
This is what we're doing."
Turn. Walk toward each other.
Is that too much for you?
- No, it's okay.
- Okay, so go to that corner
over there.
So I'm hoping she doesn't fall
or break something.
<i>Pretty easy, right?</i>
- Uh, no.
This is a lot to learn.
-<i> ♪ Chapter two ♪</i>
<i>♪ Turn another page ♪</i>
-<i> We literally only had</i>
<i>about ten minutes</i>
<i>to hear the song before.</i>
<i>The lip-sync isn't down</i>
<i>for either of us.</i>
I mean, I don't know the song,
my drag mother
doesn't know the song,
but really, it's rehearsal time,
so we have to go through
the choreography.
And then this is where
I'll pose,
and you do something
a little dirty.
-<i> ♪ Starts to fade ♪</i>
- Creating a monster.
- I think I am.
<i>I think I've created a monster.</i>
Back, Litter Boxx.
Back to your spot.
-<i> My mother's hairy.</i>
My mother has hairy arms,
hairy knuckles,
hairy back, and that beard
is going buh-bye.
- Raven's, uh, grooming.
- Beauty salon.
I had to shave
my fucking mother.
So you're done, Mama.
- Thank you, daughter.
- How do you feel, Mama?
- The performance
is gonna be difficult.
I wasn't expecting that.
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able
to memorize all these lyrics.
- I'm gonna go sit down.
I'm exhausted.
- Yeah, go ahead.
-<i> None of these bitches</i>
<i>better die overnight.</i>
They better not.
Gonna come back tomorrow,
"Your mother died last night."
- [laughing]
- Morning.
- Hello.
- Well, it's your day of beauty,
Mother.
- So today our challenge is,
we have to turn
a 60-year-old man
<i>into our drag mother.</i>
<i>They need to embody</i>
<i>our persona,</i>
<i>and they have to perform</i>
<i>with us a lip-sync</i>
to<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> by RuPaul.</i>
Are you excited for today?
- Yeah.
I'll be more excited
when I find out that you stay.
-<i> It's definitely odd</i>
<i>to be bonding</i>
<i>with someone twice my age,</i>
but I already feel very close
to my drag mom.
- It's nerve-racking.
- It is.
- [laughs]
- I've never had a drag mother
before.
I'm so happy.
- It might be easier,
because, you know,
you might get makeup on it
if you take it off after.
- Oh.
- Oh, God.
<i>My drag mother, Litter Boxx,</i>
has arrived in a red, white,
and blue bikini.
- You blowin' me?
- All I thought is,
"Just do the makeup.
"Just do the makeup.
<i>"Do the makeup, Pandora.</i>
<i>Don't look."</i>
- Who is Oscar Wilde?
- I went--who is Oscar Wilde?
Who is Oscar Wilde?
- Oh, my gosh, are you serious?
-<i> Who is Oscar Wilde?</i>
- That's no homosexual
over there.
- We are here to educate
the young.
- She told me, and I was like,
"Great, fantastic."
- There is a pantheon
one should learn.
- Look straight up
at the ceiling.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I'm sure he knows
Harvey Milk with all the--
- Yes.
- Can y'all stop talking to her?
'Cause she needs to close
her eyes.
- Okay.
- Well, he can close his eyes
and talk at the same time.
- Well, obviously she can't,
because she's opening her eyes.
I was just like, "Mom,
get your shit together!"
-<i> I'm just a little worried</i>
<i>about the time constraint,</i>
getting not only myself
but Annalisha ready too.
- And then pull that up.
<i>I'm getting my mom dressed,</i>
and I realized that Mom
doesn't have the body
that I need Mom to have.
[duct tape ripping]
<i>So I took duct tape and I put</i>
<i>duct tape all around Mom</i>
just to give her the hips
that she needed
and that she deserved.
- No, I'm not.
- [laughs]
- [laughing]
Hello, judges.
<i>- Hey, Ru.</i>
<i>- Hello, Ru.</i>
- Well, well, well,
<i>Cloris Leachman, darling,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>
- Excellent, thank you.
- Santino, how are you tonight?
- You are making a spectacle
of yourself, Ru.
- Really?
- And I love it. I love it.
- Merle, what about you?
How are you doing?
- I am just freaking out
over my fine feathered friend.
- Aw, you're sweet.
<i>Debbie Reynolds, you are</i>
and you will always be
America's sweetheart.
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>
- Thank you for having me here.
- Toni Ko, you're finally here.
- How are you?
-<i> The girls love NYX Cosmetics.</i>
<i>It's fantastic!</i>
Well, we have a show for you
tonight.
This week, our ladies
were challenged
to transform a silver fox
into a golden girl.
<i>Are you ready for a little</i>
<i>mother-daughter fashion show?</i>
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
This is Raven and her
drag mother, Golda Lamé.
-<i> She's totally freaked out</i>
<i>about walking.</i>
<i>I just was very nervous</i>
<i>that she was gonna fall.</i>
<i>I mean, doesn't walk in heels,</i>
<i>but she's sparkling,</i>
<i>and she's loving it.</i>
-<i> Mama mia!</i>
[laughter]
<i>A cougar and her cub.</i>
<i>Pandora Boxx and her</i>
<i>drag mother, Litter Boxx.</i>
<i>This is the Boxx family.</i>
- And she's gonna show us
her box later?
[laughter]
- Oh, dear God.
-<i> I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>about our outfits.</i>
<i>They're kind of, like,</i>
<i>you know, showgirl today,</i>
<i>showgirl yesterday.</i>
<i>There's sense of comedy</i>
<i>about it.</i>
-<i> It's 10:00.</i>
<i>Do you know where your</i>
<i>drag mother is?</i>
<i>This is Jujubee</i>
<i>and the Contessa Touché.</i>
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>is feeling spectacular.</i>
<i>She has stepped</i>
<i>into the boundary of Jujubee,</i>
<i>and she feels wonderful.</i>
-<i> "I'm pretty, Mama.</i>
<i>I'm a pretty girl."</i>
<i>Tatianna and her drag mother,</i>
<i>Annalisha.</i>
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>does have a limp,</i>
<i>but, um, she's pushing</i>
<i>through it,</i>
<i>and she's not letting it</i>
<i>stop her.</i>
[laughter]
- No, you are gonna phone me
later.
<i>- Tyra Sanchez and her mother,</i>
<i>Big Tyra.</i>
-<i> My drag mother was having</i>
<i>a very good time on the runway.</i>
<i>She has the attitude,</i>
<i>she has the walk,</i>
<i>and she has the smile.</i>
<i>She was very comfortable</i>
<i>and confident in drag.</i>
-<i> The apple bottom don't fall</i>
<i>far from the tree.</i>
[laughter]
- It's time for our mothers
and daughters
to make their performance debut.

- 'Cause, I mean,

-<i> Gorgeous!</i>
- Will they do that for me

- Yes, they will, absolutely.
- Thank you. That'd be good.
-<i> Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the next generation.
I'm having a senior moment...
and I'm loving it!
Raven, let's start with you.
- This is Ms. Golda Lamé.
- Let's take a look
at your drag mother before.
<i>Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>
- We used a dark brown
eye shadow.
We didn't want to use pencil
because it looks a little harsh.
- I can see that you're wearing
the exact same makeup.
- I am.
- You guys coordinate
without matching too much,
<i>and it works</i>
<i>for both body types.</i>
- Your lip-sync
was very, very good too,
which I noticed right away,
because in films,
that's what we always did.
I mean, people thought
we were really singing.
Well, we did sing, but we had
to then sing to our record,
so it's not easy
to lip-sync correctly,
<i>and you did a super job.</i>
<i>And I've never seen anybody</i>
<i>quite dance like the mother.</i>
You won't give Ginger Rogers
any contest, you know?
[laughter]
- Raven, is there anything
you want to say?
- Thank you for this experience
and for allowing me to work
with Steven.
I respect Steven so much
because he did a lot
as far as the gay rights
liberation.
I thank you.
- Thank you.
-<i> Aw!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
[applause]
- It's because
of people like Steven
that we are able
to do this show.
Pandora Boxx, please introduce
your drag mother.
- This is my drag mother,
Litter Boxx.
-<i> Aw!</i>
Hi, Litter.
Welcome.
Now, Pandora, your drag mother
also has a reputation
for being a nudist.
- It's a lot easier
being a nudist
than it is being a drag queen.
- I agree.
[laughter]
- Is she wearing her Clorisline
panties underneath the outfit?
- She is--I hope she's wearing
some panties.
- Now let's take a look
at your drag mother before.
<i>Wow.</i>
-<i> I wanted her to look like</i>
<i>a more mature version of me.</i>
I wanted to do a softer liner.
- You look like me!
- I thought so too!
- I love the high energy
and the comedy,
and I love Mom coming out
and giving us attitude
<i>and you pulling her back like,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm so embarrassed."</i>
- Mom was wanting to shine
and give more and more,
and you were kind of
pulling her back,
and that was--
- Had the mother been drinking?
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
- This is my mother,
Contessa Touché.
-<i> Oh, wow.</i>
-<i> We're going</i>
<i>for the natural look.</i>
-<i> Yes, of course.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Of course.
I did do a little eye shadow
to just kind of cut
into the cheek,
down the rims of the nose.
I used my Ru glue
to cover the eyebrows.
- I really wish Mama
would have had a longer do.
- The one thing that I thought
you did too much of was,
<i>your mouth was open so wide,</i>
<i>and all the words--</i>
<i>lip-syncing, you don't need</i>
<i>to do that.</i>
- Mama's lip-sync kind of
fell apart in a couple places.
- Tatianna.
- This is Annalisha.
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>
-<i> We actually used a little bit</i>
<i>of, like, a red lipstick</i>
<i>to counteract the beard color.</i>
I used the pink blush
on the apples of the cheek
<i>just to give a little flush.</i>
- I would've used
a brighter color lips.
- Older ladies do not wear
dark brown lips
unless they're Judy Davis.
-<i> I thought your lip-sync</i>
<i>was very good.</i>
The walker killed me.
I loved it a lot.
- Your facial expression too,
I loved it.
<i>I thought it added</i>
<i>to the whole performance.</i>
- You were really funny.
- Thank you.
- Tyra Sanchez.
- My drag mother's name
is Tyra,
which makes me
the other Tyra.
- That's right.
-<i> Oh!</i>
-<i> I mixed a couple</i>
<i>of the colors together</i>
<i>to get her skin color,</i>
and then I took
some of the blush
<i>and I put just a little</i>
<i>on her cheeks,</i>
<i>and I put, like, a nice</i>
<i>metallic silver onto her bone</i>
to make her eyes stand out
a little bit more.
- There's a lot of fun
in that hair.
<i>Your style translated</i>
<i>onto your mother.</i>
You're the only one who really
did identical outfits.
-<i> I should've known you'd have</i>
a classy Park Avenue
fashionable mother.
<i>On Mom, though, I might have</i>
<i>toned the lip down.</i>
<i>The makeup's a little heavy.</i>
- Now, Debbie Reynolds
is quite the hoofer.
- I knew you'd--I knew
she'd pick right up on that.
<i>The dancing,</i>
<i>it was exceptional,</i>
<i>choreography, the stage work.</i>
<i>The mother, with the hair,</i>
<i>could've been a little less,</i>
but then, you know, uh,
that's the kick of it.
- Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
<i>in the Interior Illusions</i>
<i>Lounge,</i>
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starting]
All right, just between
us girls.
<i>First up, we had Raven.</i>
- Raven did a great job
with the transformation.
Her mother did look like Raven.
-<i> She did have</i>
<i>the essence of Raven.</i>
What really carried the day
for me
is that Raven seemed
so protective of her mother,
<i>who's a tiny little person</i>
<i>who couldn't walk in heels,</i>
and we haven't seen that many
sweet sides to Raven,
<i>and the mother brought out</i>
<i>the sweetness in her.</i>
- You just kind of really felt
a kinship growing.
It's gonna be
a buddy system there.
- That's what we're about here
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
putting families together.
<i>Pandora Boxx and her mother.</i>
- Pandora's mother, Litter Boxx,
<i>actually was funnier</i>
<i>and kind of stole the show.</i>
- And I thought the mother
was really playing a part too.
She was playing the tough mama.
- Her mother kind of
showed her up a little bit.
-<i> Jujubee.</i>
Cloris, you commented
that her mouth was just open.
She was doing the old trick,
<i>"Peas and carrots," you know,</i>
<i>when you don't know the words?</i>
- It put me off
because it was so exaggerated
<i>that it wasn't real.</i>
- Well, that's what I'm looking
for in my drag queens:
realness.
- They both look very beautiful
and exotic,
but I just did not like
that hair.
-<i> Tatianna.</i>
- I had so many other things
written on other people
that I only have "wheelchair"
written there,
<i>and if you can make anything</i>
<i>out of that...</i>
[laughter]
And wonderful design, I think,
of the dresses.
- I have to say, I liked her
mother's dress better than hers.
<i>I thought that long dress</i>
<i>made the mother look</i>
<i>like she had a great,</i>
<i>sexy body.</i>
- Really, overall,
I think Tatianna
might have pulled it out
this week.
-<i> Tyra Sanchez.</i>
- I just thought Tyra
was so beautiful,
even though
you didn't ask me yet.
[laughter]
- Well, this is the--
this is the moment now.
<i>Oh, you're giving a--</i>
- Ooh!
-<i> Oh!</i>
I did think the mother's makeup
was a little crazy exaggerated.
- Well, I'm with Cloris.
I vote ten.
<i>They were very chic.</i>
<i>I didn't like the mother's wig,</i>
<i>of course not,</i>
but obviously, it was
a little bit of humor there.
- So is that a ten or what?
- I vote for a ten, yeah.
- Ten, that's three tens.
[laughter]
- Okay, silence.
<i>I have made my decision.</i>
Bring back the girls.
<i>Welcome back.</i>
At this point, it's not about
who's the worst.
<i>It's about who's the best</i>
<i>of the best,</i>
the next drag superstar.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra,
you proved that two Tyras
are better than one.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
- Tatianna, this week,
you came from behind
and rolled over the competition.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pandora Boxx,
you're a funny girl,
but tonight you were
outperformed.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-<i> I thought that I was campy</i>
<i>and fun.</i>
<i>I really gave it my all.</i>
<i>I really, really worked hard.</i>
It's like a kick in the balls.
- Raven, for giving
the most dramatic makeover
<i>and literally carrying</i>
<i>Golda Lamé,</i>
proving that she ain't heavy;
she's your mama--
<i>Raven, congratulations,</i>
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Thank you.
[applause]
-<i> You and your drag mother</i>
have won a four-day,
three-night stay and massage
<i>at the luxurious East Canyon</i>
<i>Hotel and Spa in Palm Springs.</i>
- I felt so amazing,
<i>and I knew that Tatianna</i>
<i>was back there</i>
<i>just grinding her toenails</i>
in the tip of her fucking heel.
Thank you, Tatianna,
for picking out my mother.
- Jujubee, you are
a special queen.
<i>But tonight, you and your</i>
<i>mother were out of sync.</i>
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-<i> I'm in the bottom,</i>
and I can't blame anybody
but myself.
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
<i>and save yourself</i>
<i>from elimination.</i>
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Jujubee...
shantay you stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
-<i> Pandora, you shared</i>
<i>your talents</i>
and opened your box
for the world to see.
<i>There's no stopping you.</i>
Now sashay away.
[applause]
[laughter]
-<i> It's hard to constantly get</i>
<i>harsh criticism,</i>
<i>especially when you feel like</i>
they're being harsher on you
than everybody else.
<i>I did really want to win.</i>
<i>But what I brought here wasn't</i>
<i>what they were looking for.</i>
Fuck 'em.
- Four queens remain.
Congratulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, let the music play.

- Gorgeous.
Innocent.
Sexy.
There's some new glamour girls
in town.
And they're sittin'
on a big ol' secret.
I'm back!
[cheering]
That's right, we're back
for an all-new season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
the search for America's
next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
We have 12 hot new queens
willing to do whatever it takes.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!
- Even if that means
they've got to drop, drop...
drop it like it's hot.
[all groan]
And in the end, it all comes
down to this.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Are you ready for the ride
of your life?
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-off.
- More stars.
- Yes, ma'am.
- More fierce.
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.
- More drama...
- Can we get someone
over here, please?
She can't breathe.
- Than ever before!
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
<i>[car engine starting,</i>
<i>tires screech]</i>
- A new season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>
about to burn rubber in three...
two...
one.
- Holy shit.
Oh, wow.
I'm first.
I'm Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
I get to pick my spot,
I guess.
Oh, wow.
I am what I call
a southern belle,
or a very Atlanta girl.
I want to be on the end.
I'm a Cancer, so I'm a big--
just a big mama.
No...
I think I want to be
on this side.
No, that's the changing area.
I want to be on this end.
- Hello, somebody.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Nicole.
- Hi, Nicole.
I'm Shangela.
- It's nice to meet you.
Tell me your name again.
- Shangela, like Angela,
but with an s-h, like "sh."
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
the debutantess
of the deep south.
All right for the country
bitches in the house.
Shangela is
a little bougie, okay?
But she's also your home girl.
How long have
you been doing drag?
- For 15 years.
- No, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.
- All right,
you've got to be perfected.
- And you?
- Only five months.
- Oh, wow.
- Fairly new.
- I hope that I don't fall into
that role of babysitting
and start, like,
fixing people's shit
when I should be really,
like, cutting their bra straps.
- What's up, bitches?
My name is David.
In drag, when I've got on tits
and tights, I go by Raven.
Bitch, this is fucking fierce.
- Oh, take a look around, girl.
Get you some.
- You didn't bring a purse
or nothin'?
- I don't carry a purse.
I stick it all in my tits.
- [laughs]
- I like to be that mysterious,
dark ice queen.
And, like, I think I have a look
that people might be
a little intimidated by.
Am I a ten?
A perfect ten.
- What a sin! Ahh!
- Oh, ohh!
- My name's Jujubee.
I'm 25,
from Boston, Massachusetts.
- I'm Nicole.
- I'm Juju.
- Juju? I love that name.
- Bitch, no, you are
Kimora Lee Simmons.
- Jujubee's just
this fabulous Asian girl.
She's very, like, poppy
and, like, fashion forward.
She loves accessories
and she likes glitter...
'cause it's wicked spah-kly.
- I'm Sahara Davenport.
I'm 25 years old.
And I live in New York City.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Aah!
- Aaah!
[both screaming]
- Sahara Davenport came in.
Sahara and I went
to college together
and have been friends forever,
and I had no idea
she was gonna be on this show.
[both screaming]
- Excuse me, pardon me.
What were you saying?
- [squealing]
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan!
- Bitch!
- My name is Morgan McMichaels,
and I am 28 years old.
- When I saw Morgan walk in,
I wanted to die.
- Hi.
- Ohh!
See, I know somebody.
Morgan's like my sister.
Like, we started doing drag
at the same time, same club.
- Hi, I'm Nicole.
- People think that
since I'm pretty and I'm sexy
that I should just do slutty
all the time.
I'm just eating
solid food again.
- Hello.
- I'm Mystique.
- Hi!
- I'm Mystique Summers.
I am 25 years old.
Big girls are gonna represent
this year.
Cheeseburger, Taco Bell, and
diet coke on the side, girl.
- Ohh!
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,
but fuck them skinny bitches.
It's a big girl's world.
- Oh, my god.
My direct persona name
is Jessica Wild.
I'm from San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
You like Puerto Ricans?
- I'm 1/4 Puerto.
- I've taken a Puerto Rican.
- My biggest fears in the
competition is with my English.
But if I don't understand
something, I am going to smile.
Uh-oh!
- My drag name is Sonique.
I now live in Atlanta, Georgia.
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my God!
- This is Sonique.
Now I know somebody.
- My mom sent me
to a military school in hopes
that she would get
a little soldier.
Needless to say,
she got a drag queen.
[laughs]
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
[all greeting her]
- Some pretty bitches in here.
- My name is Tatianna.
I am 21 years old.
both: Mwah. Mwah.
- It's a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Tatianna.
- First time I walked out
of the house in drag,
I was 14 years old.
I don't know how I had the balls
to do it,
but I went to school in drag.
It was my closest taste
of being, like, famous.
Thank you.
- Hey, fake ladies!
[all greeting her]
- I'm Pandora Boxx, and I'm
30-blah-blah years old.
Hey, girls.
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- I'm Pandora.
Pandora is definitely a melting
pot of different people.
You know, there's like a dash
of Madonna,
a sprinkle of Goldie Hawn,
and a big chunk of Kathy Griffin
thrown in there.
And she has to kind of like fuse
it all together
into this melted pot of goo
that becomes Pandora.
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.
- Aah! Yes, ma'am!
- I made this.
- You better work.
Look at this.
- Me and miss Pandora, we're
gonna be real good friends.
- Oh!
- Here's another one.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I am Tyra Sanchez, and I'm 21.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Beautiful.
- How gorgeous.
- Da-yamn.
- It's sickening.
- What a body.
- I do think
that I'm the prettiest one.
- Tyra, all right.
Are you bankable, girl?
- [chuckles] Yes.
- I came in,
I had my Rihanna hair on.
My body was right, breasts were
right, makeup was right.
Everything was on point.
I was very much a lady.
- I'm super-excited to get
to know the girls.
Different personalities,
different genres of drag,
different styles of drag.
I really couldn't make
a judgment
on who was the strongest
and who was the weakest.
<i>- Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got she mail.</i>
<i>Welcome, racers,</i>
<i>to another glorious season</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>You're here today</i>
<i>because, well,</i>
<i>none of you were smart enough</i>
<i>to leak a sex tape</i>
<i>and land your own</i>
<i>reality TV show.</i>
<i>[laughing] No, no, no.</i>
<i>You've come here to compete</i>
<i>for the title</i>
<i>of America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
<i>But to win it,</i>
<i>you've got to earn it, Tina.</i>
<i>Fasten your seatbelts.</i>
<i>This year's ride is gonna be</i>
<i>longer and harder,</i>
<i>with more twists and turns</i>
<i>than Kim Kardashian trying to</i>
<i>wiggle out of a pair of Spanx.</i>
<i>So let's put the stiletto</i>
<i>to the metal.</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race<i> is</i>
<i>about to blow you away.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- When I see RuPaul enter
the room for the first time,
I'm in a state of shock.
- I am gagging
at the lovely extravaganza.
Wonderful. Hello.
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna.
- Holy shit.
I'm shaking the hand
of a legend.
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- From Atlanta, Georgia.
- That's right, the ATL.
You're Pandora.
- Pandora Boxx.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Great, great.
- It's really, really cool to
have somebody that you idolize
come over and just--and say
your name immediately.
- You're all so gorgeous.
- I was a little star struck,
I guess.
- I'm so happy you are all here.
Anybody who steps out
of the house
with a pair of high heels
and a wig is my hero.
We searched from coast to coast,
and you are the chosen 12.
[cheers and applause]
All of you are here because you
have charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
But do you have that little
something extra it takes to win?
The stakes are high, ladies,
but the rewards are fabulous.
In addition to walking away
with the title
of America's next drag
superstar,
the winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and become the face
of nyxcosmetics.com;
an exclusive, one-year PR
contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity;
be featured in L.A. Eyeworks'
legendary designer eyewear
campaign;
and headline
LOGO's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks.
And a cash prize of $25,000.
[cheers and applause]
All right, ladies, enough talk.
Are you ready
for your close-ups?
[all cheer]
- Good.
Now, please put your hands
and legs together
for top celebrity photographer
and my good friend Mike Ruiz.
[cheers and applause]
- Okay, ladies, your first
official<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photo shoot</i>
is inspired by one of my
favorite movies of all time:
<i>Gone With The Wind.</i>
- [gasps]
- Yes.
Now, you'll each pose for Mike,
and then we'll choose
the one queen
who gives the best face, face,
face, I give face, beauty, face.
- Oh, my gosh, it's here.
Competition's on, bitches.
[camera shutter snapping]
- Today, we're doing
a photo shoot
which is inspired
by<i> Gone With The Wind.</i>
- What does she need to know?
- It's the height
of the Civil War.
You need to straddle the cannon,
work the piece of fabric, and,
you know, kind of
interact with the guys.
They're being thrust into
an environment, which, you know,
they're unfamiliar with and they
didn't have any preparation for.
- Yeah, straddle that cannon,
hon.
- Hold on...hold on right here.
- [laughing]
- And here we go.
- All right!
- Oh, lord! Oh, my God.
- Aah!
- Work! Work the fabric!
- Storm comes up, and they're
snapping pictures.
And I don't know what to do.
- Watch your hair!
Your hair is covering your face.
- Work the camera, Jujubee!
Work!
- I feel a little tug
in the back of my leg,
and I think it's gonna fly off,
so I'm grasping onto it.
And then my lashes are just
flapping back and forth.
That's all I can focus on.
I didn't know where the camera
was at this point.
- We got it!
- All right!
How do you feel, Jujubee?
- I have never been blown
like that in my life.
[laughter]
- Yes, you got a
lot of firepower
between your legs, girl.
Don't nobody make a sudden move.
She might blow it.
- When I saw the fan,
I was excited.
'Cause fans make
everything prettier.
- Okay, and...there we go!
- Ooh! Lord Jesus!
When they started cranking up
the fan, I was just like,
ugh, really?
- Watch your hair in your face.
All right, we got it!
Sonique, ride that cannon.
- Yeah, that hits the spot.
Pandora's box is on fire!
- All right!
- Jessica's a girl gone wild!
Yeah! Serve it!
Suzanne Sugarbaker!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Triumphant!
As god is my witness.
Uh-oh!
Those damn Yankees took
everything from you!
- Morgan McMichaels had
a problem
with having her wig fly off,
and she tried to recover
from it,
but I find
that she never really did.
- 3, 2, 1!
Okay, we got it.
That's it.
We did get a good shot,
but it was a struggle.
Thank you, Morgan.
- Thanks, Morgan.
Wow, the competition has
just begun
and they're already flipping
their wigs.
- Honey, how was it?
- I mean, this wig
went on vacation, girl.
She flew right off.
- [laughing]
- As I see everybody changing,
the thing that stood out most
to me is, kind of forget,
like, how much it really takes
to transform somebody
and how amazingly different
they can look
from--from one to the other.
- I wonder what everyone's
gonna look like out of drag.
I hope some of you are
attractive boys, like me.
- [laughing]
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- From Atlanta, Georgia.
- That's right.
- And I will never go hungry
again.
- All right.
- Am I gonna pinch your nipples?
Ohh! They bounce too.
This one's jealous.
- Oh, I think it's leaking.
- Nicole had all
of the southern charm,
but I felt like
in the photoshoot situation,
you know,
she wasn't delivering couture,
she was delivering, you know,
little catalog.
Look off into the distance,
off into the horizon.
Too far off, too far off,
sister.
Sahara Davenport had a really
great understanding of her body
and how to move.
Although she didn't have
that same understanding
with her face.
- We're gonna sit you
on that cannon
with these
two gorgeous soldiers.
- And I'm like, "Oh, my god,
you want me to stand
next to them?"
- Don't teeter over it.
- I can't cross my legs,
anything.
The skirt is so tight.
I'm like trying my hardest
to be perfect.
- Chin down a little bit.
Remember the camera's down here.
- Chin down!
- I felt that I could
have did better.
I should have been just, like
more focused
on the picture itself.
- We got it!
- Got it! Wonderful.
- Be aware of the camera.
Pretty, pretty face.
- Pretty face.
Think Franklin mint plate.
- Ha ha, yeah.
- I wanted to bring
the most fiercest possible.
- Chicken cutlets!
Chicken cutlets.
- But my boobs were falling out
the top of the dress.
RuPaul's screaming,
Mike is screaming,
and through my head is going,
"bitch, pull it together.
Look at that camera
and pull it together."
both: Yes!
- Cover up, dear.
[laughing]
Ooh, is that a possum
in the woods?
[laughter]
Yes, yes!
War is hell!
But you look gorgeous!
- [laughing] Right.
All right, we got it!
- Gorgeous!
- That is
what I'm talkin' about.
- Yes.
- [sighs]
I love a good blow job.
- [giggles] Brat.
- That was amazing.
Ohh.
I was able to spread my cooch
and air it out.
- Immediately, Raven and Morgan
were kind of off-putting.
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.
- We're all staring
at each other,
'cause we're just in shock.
You is naked.
- I think Morgan is gonna get
on my nerves.
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, wait, wait,
these are my wigs.
- Do you usually do your own
hair and makeup, or...
- Um...technically, well, no.
The answer is no.
I felt that people
were looking down on me
for only doing this
for five months.
It just made me feel more
determined to show them
that I can do it.
Bah, bah, bah! Whoop!
Uhh!
- Hey, dolls.
Come on down.
Gather around.
Mike and I went over
all your photos.
You each did a great job.
But only one of you
can be the best.
The winner of the first
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photoshoot is...</i>
Raven.
- Oh, my god.
[applause]
Congratulations.
- I think me winning the
first challenge is gonna make
the other bitches
kind of open their eyes,
'cause I plan on winning
the grand prize.
- Have fun tonight,
'cause when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
tomorrow is another day.
[alarm beeping]
- Gather round, dolls.
Now, if you haven't guessed
by now,
<i>Gone With The Wind</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>
the inspiration
for your first main challenge.
Now, Scarlett O'Hara was one
fierce bitch.
She survived the Civil War,
the fires of Atlanta,
and the ransacking of Tara.
And still, she was able to turn
out a drop-dead gorgeous outfit,
just using the curtains
in her window.
And now it's your turn to do
the same.
Inspired by
Miss Scarlett O'Hara,
you must create
your best drag look
using just these curtains,
courtesy of smith+noble.
And in the work room, we've got
some used home furnishings
we picked up at
Out of the Closet
that you can use to accessorize.
You'll wear your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.
And when it comes to makeup,
NYX Cosmetics has you covered.
Tomorrow, you'll be debuting
your stunning
"gone with the window"
drag looks on the main stage.
Raven, since you won
the photoshoot,
you get to choose
your curtains first.
Choose wisely.
Take your time.
That's what winning
the challenge gets you.
Take note, girls.
- I'm gonna go with these.
- You're going with those?
- Yes.
- No, don't pick that one.
- In a moment, I'm gonna let
the rest of you fight it out.
And remember, only one
matching set of curtains each.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[giggling]
- There weren't no ladies on
that set today.
There were men
running for curtains.
You pushed me! You pushed me!
- This is mine.
- It is on now.
- I dashed for the first set
of curtains I saw.
And along came Tatianna,
and she grabbed the same one.
- Reach all you want to.
Reach all you want to.
- Y'all could go get
another one.
- This is mine.
I was like, back up off.
I wasn't letting go.
And so she didn't hold on
any longer after that.
I win.
- I got to the curtain first.
And I pulled it down first.
It really wasn't that classy
of her to do that.
- Ooh, I broke a nail.
- Keep it moving, bitches.
- No, sir!
<i>- The rules of the challenge</i>
<i>are pick a set of curtains</i>
<i>and make your costume from it.</i>
<i>We also have to incorporate</i>
<i>homewear,</i>
<i>pieces from Out of the Closet.</i>
- I'm going to be flawless
with this.
- Pandora, get that table back
there; you can have that one.
- I was trying to figure out
where I was going
and where we were putting
our stuff.
And then Shangela said,
"come over here,
come over to this station,
and we'll work together."
And I was like,
"You want to work together
because you don't know how
to sew, and I know how to sew."
- Could I beg you just to, like,
show me how to sew
that little piece together?
Quickly.
- I guess.
- Hey, I'm not gonna ask him
to do it for me.
I want to learn.
But I need to be right there
next to the teacher.
<i>[squeals]</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>Look what happened.</i>
<i>Is that supposed to happen?</i>
- Oh, what are you doing?
- I did it.
I just pushed the foot pedal.
- If I don't get to finish my
outfit 'cause I run out of time,
then I'll be like,
"Damn you bitches!"
<i>- Sahara, I'm sewing.</i>
<i>Thank you!</i>
<i>- You better work, diva.</i>
Work!
- Oh, my god, Pandora.
- Mystique felt like the fabric
wasn't plus-size girl-friendly.
What size are you?
- 22.
- Really?
- Mystique looks like she's
making a huge pillowcase.
For Mystique to sit there
and think that her curtains
are not plus-size-friendly
is a crock of shit.
<i>- Bitch...I'm doing</i>
<i>something wrong.</i>
- You're doing something wrong?
- Mine is broke.
I broke...
- You what?
You broke the needle?
- No, I just broke
the whole machine.
Yeah, this is an issue.
- So now we're fucked.
- I should get ready,
'cause I'll have to lip-sync
for my life in a minute.
- Hey, is anybody home?
all: Hello.
- Clean up this mess!
No, just kidding.
Keep working.
Hi, Mystique.
- Hey, girl.
- All right.
How's it going for you?
- Kind of rough.
- Rough? Really?
- Oh, you don't have a, uh...
- No.
- Dress for it.
- This is the biggest one.
- Why don't you pad it?
- I don't got time for that.
- Well, this challenge is about
overcoming adversity and--
- Oh, yeah.
- You'll do it.
- Like I said, fucking bitches
fucking up the house.
- I'm gonna come over here
to Shangela.
- Hey, Ru.
- What's your inspiration?
- Well, this is gonna be a hot
gun concoction.
- I see.
- Along with--I'm gonna also do
some sewing, and Pandora 's
kind of helped show me
the machine.
- I see.
- I might be the new bitch
on the block,
but in order to be on the show,
I quit my job, because I love
performing as Shangela.
So I have 100% committed myself
to this.
- Oh, my goodness, corn?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be using corn?
- It is "the south will rise"
meets<i> Children of the Corn.</i>
- I've seen great potential
in you,
so you've got to--you've got
to bring it, honey.
Tyra.
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Now, you have a child.
- I do have a son.
His name is Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah --oh, that's
the tattoo you have there.
- Yeah, tattoo on my arm.
- Why, Jeremiah?
- Um, we wanted a name from
the bible.
My name comes from the bible,
so--
- Tyra 's in the bible?
- No, not Tyra.
James is in the bible.
- [laughing]
He was born the first week
of my 12th grade year.
It's like the first time I'll be
away from him this long.
My son is, like, my major
motivation
for winning this competition.
- You know, a family that drags
together,
stays together.
All right.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Sahara, hi, honey.
- Hi, Ru.
- You put a lot of work into
this bustier.
- I have.
- And is this the vision you had
from the very start?
- I don't know where I'm going
with it, to be honest.
- Are you a little worried
about that?
- Of course I'm worried!
I still want to be gorgeous,
but I also want to have a good--
a good garment to show.
- Yeah.
I think you got a little bit
more work to do,
so I don't want to keep you.
- All right, thank you.
- Hello, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- This is what you wanted.
- Yes.
- But you haven't gotten
very far here.
- No.
- What's going on?
- Looking at it from
a distance,
I chose it 'cause it looked like
it more of a silver hue
that I could maybe do
silver shoes with.
- Right.
So you're looking for an accent
to match your shoes.
- Mm-hmm.
Because to me if you have a--
- You have big feet?
- 13.
- Yeah, well, that never
stopped me.
- But I also don't like to show
my toes.
- You don't like to show
your toes.
- My big toe is shaped
like a doorknob,
and so I don't think
it looks good
in open-toed shoes.
- Well, I mean, just...
crazy--I have got to see
your toe.
Can I please see your toe?
Because you can't go through
life...
- Hiding my big toe?
See?
It's just too big.
- That is a gorgeous toe.
I know people who would pay
to suck that toe.
- [laughs]
- I say let it go.
Let it go.
And that advice is gonna help
you in this competition.
You have to go for it,
and don't let anything
stop you.
- Okay.
- Free your toes...
And the rest will follow.
- [laughs]
- Hey, Jessica.
Can I see what you're doing?
- Yes, I get this because
I love the color,
but it is very clear,
and I have problems
with that,
because I don't want to look
like I am naked.
- You don't want to look
like a whore, do you?
- No!
Not on camera.
- [laughs]
Maybe after the show.
- Yeah.
- What's underneath here?
- I use a corset.
- Oh, is it a corset
you brought from home?
- Yes, and I make this.
- I make in...
Sorry,
explain it in Spanish.
- Just a little top,
and you could say it in Spanish
if you like.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
- Okay...
[speaking Spanish]
-<i> Si.</i>
- [speaking Spanish]
-<i> Muy bien, muy bien.</i>
Ooh.
- Because it's going to give
a special touch.
- Oh, wow.
Now, do you pad anything?
- I don't have a lady body.
- Can we see?
- I have a guy butt.
- [laughing]
- And I need to make the curves
of a lady.
- I can't wait to see it
on the main stage.
- Thanks, Ru.
- All right, I'm gonna move
over here
to see miss Morgan
and see what you're up to.
- Hi.
- What are your plans for?
- Okay, now, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do with the sleeves.
But I think I'm gonna do
the high neck
and maybe try and incorporate
this into it.
- Ah, wow.
- I got this.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, which is huge.
I could use this as a skirt,
really.
- And you feel like you have
enough time?
- Um, I will make time.
I will get it done.
- I see.
All right, ladies.
<i>Gather round.</i>
I'll see you tomorrow on
the main stage,
where our extra-special guest
judge will be...
Kathy Griffin.
- [gasping]
- I really identify with
Kathy Griffin.
I love her, so I'm excited that
she's gonna be here.
- Now, remember, in this world,
you only get one chance to make
a first impression.
So don't fuck It up.
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>
- I'm kind of scared about what
the judges are gonna say.
With this hot-ass mess I'm gonna
wear out there tomorrow,
this is gonna be brutal.
- Whoo! Burning!
[all chattering]
<i>- Tonight is my first day that</i>
<i>I'm going to walk the runway.</i>
So I have a lot of great
emotions.
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.
The only thing on my mind
is finish this garment.
- What you think, Sahara?
- Ooh, yeah.
- I think Mystique is a mistake.
<i>- I love doing drag because</i>
<i>I love the transformation--</i>
<i>the costuming, the hair,</i>
<i>the makeup.</i>
<i>The glamour of it all.</i>
It is an art form.
<i>- To be able to change yourself</i>
<i>into a completely different</i>
<i>person</i>
<i>is very empowering.</i>
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys.
So happy to see all of you.
Santino,
so good to have you back.
- I've missed you.
- Merle, you look marvelous
tonight.
- My world's been empty
without you, Ru.
- Hey, Mike, what do you think
of our queens so far?
- Oh, I'm very impressed.
- And miss Kathy Griffin,
welcome to the show.
- Ru, I cannot believe that you
dismembered our first lady
and stole Michelle Obama's arms.
They are perfect, as are you.
- Okay, judges, for this week's
challenge,
inspired by miss
Scarlett O'Hara,
the girls had to turn
out a breathtaking drag look
using just curtains
and some used home furnishings.
Are you ready to see what
they've created?
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
<i>- I think that I do have</i>
<i>a good chance</i>
<i>at winning this challenge.</i>
<i>My dress looks amazing.</i>
<i>- I love the fabric</i>
<i>of the underdress.</i>
<i>It's actually the carpet</i>
<i>and the drapes.</i>
- Oh, wow.
<i>- And they don't match,</i>
<i>and they don't need to,</i>
<i>not today.</i>
<i>- That's so 2000.</i>
<i>There is nothing dirty about</i>
<i>this Sanchez.</i>
<i>- Here comes some sass.</i>
<i>- Yes, sassy miss Raven.</i>
<i>- My runway walk is giving them</i>
<i>a little hip action.</i>
<i>Flip of the hair,</i>
<i>working it out,</i>
<i>giving them sex.</i>
<i>- I do like the focus</i>
<i>on the waist.</i>
<i>- Yes, now she--</i>
<i>- Even when there isn't one,</i>
<i>she kind of manufactured one.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>
<i>- Which is essential</i>
<i>in your business.</i>
- Wow.
<i>- Sonique, boom.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Southern belle, African,</i>
<i>playboy mansion,</i>
<i>all rolled into one.</i>
<i>I definitely think that no one</i>
<i>else came up with that concept.</i>
- I wonder what she uses
that rod for.
<i>Here is Jujubee.</i>
<i>- I feel great--</i>
<i>sickly, gorgeous.</i>
<i>I wasn't going for pretty.</i>
<i>I was going for fierce.</i>
<i>I put on my feathers</i>
<i>and I felt like a big ol' style</i>
<i>warrior goddess.</i>
<i>- Lauren Bacall would love</i>
<i>that collar.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- She will wrestle you</i>
<i>to the ground for that collar.</i>
<i>- Everyone's doing redhead,</i>
<i>Kathy.</i>
<i>- Look at those gams.</i>
<i>- The legs are killing me.</i>
<i>- I didn't really know what</i>
<i>to do.</i>
<i>The lights are in my eyes.</i>
<i>I see Ru 's teeth glowing</i>
<i>at me.</i>
<i>Freaking out inside.</i>
<i>- She's serving some</i>
<i>Raquel Welch there,</i>
<i>and I don't just mean her hair.</i>
<i>- Sahara.</i>
<i>- Uh-oh, it's raining.</i>
<i>- She is throwing</i>
<i>some serious shade.</i>
<i>- We'll see her poolside</i>
<i>in South Beach.</i>
<i>- I'm excited to work</i>
<i>the runway.</i>
<i>That's one of my favorite</i>
<i>things.</i>
<i>- I like the mix of the blues.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Looks great.</i>
<i>- It's refreshing.</i>
<i>- As I step onto the runway, it</i>
<i>can be a little intimidating.</i>
<i>You don't want to fuck It up in</i>
<i>front of RuPaul.</i>
<i>- There's corn hanging</i>
<i>from her hand!</i>
<i>- What is that corn doing</i>
<i>there?</i>
<i>- I've been corn cobbed.</i>
<i>- It's a co--you been</i>
<i>corn cobbed?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Jessica Wild.</i>
<i>- Wild flower.</i>
<i>- It's inspiring, a movie that</i>
<i>I never saw.</i>
<i>But in my imagination,</i>
<i>that girl is amazing,</i>
<i>like Jessica, so...</i>
<i>- How did she get it back from</i>
<i>the sweatshop so quickly?</i>
<i>'cause it looks like it took</i>
<i>many, many children</i>
<i>to make those flowers.</i>
<i>- You're absolutely right.</i>
-<i> It's a lot of work.</i>
<i>- Morgan McMichaels.</i>
<i>Look at that body.</i>
<i>- My attitude is a positive</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i>I will not go home.</i>
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>will not send me home.</i>
<i>- I love the little belt</i>
<i>and the little belly jewel.</i>
<i>- I love the little eyelids</i>
<i>there.</i>
<i>- And I never met a grommet</i>
<i>I didn't like.</i>
<i>- Yeah, grommets are fabulous.</i>
<i>- Me too. I don't know</i>
<i>what that is, but I agree.</i>
- [laughing]
<i>All right!</i>
<i>- That's not just an outfit;</i>
<i>it's a lifestyle.</i>
<i>- Who needs a hybrid</i>
<i>when you could have a basket</i>
<i>on your head?</i>
<i>- I pulled out every single</i>
<i>trick that I have in the bag.</i>
<i>- Ohh!</i>
[laughter]
<i>- If I was gonna go home,</i>
<i>I was gonna be memorable</i>
<i>for something.</i>
<i>- Nicole Paige brooks.</i>
<i>- My outfit's like the madame</i>
<i>running the saloon</i>
<i>down the street</i>
<i>from the Tara</i>
<i>that's burning down.</i>
- Yes, miss thing's got a little
bustle in her hustle.
Vivien Westwood
does Vivien Leigh.
- Oh, my God,
I wish I 'd said that!
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
- I can't believe that bitch
went into my purse
and took that wig.
<i>I just can't even believe it.</i>
<i>- It's like a body double.</i>
<i>- There's only one chance</i>
<i>I'm gonna get</i>
<i>to walk a runway in front</i>
<i>of Kathy Griffin,</i>
<i>and I am wearing that wig.</i>
<i>- Hello, dolls.</i>
I have to say,
anyone who has the courage
to break free
and follow their heart
is my hero.
Based on your "gone with
the window" challenge,
your photoshoot,
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Jujubee.
Tatianna.
<i>Raven.</i>
<i>Sonique.</i>
Jessica Wild.
Nicole Paige Brooks.
Here's the bad news.
None of you are the best.
And here is the good news.
<i>None of you are the worst.</i>
<i>Congratulations...</i>
you're all safe.
- I don't fucking like
being just safe.
I wanted to be one
of the top ones.
- As you move forward in this
competition,
I have one piece of advice
for you.
<i>Step up your game.</i>
You may leave the stage.
For you six, one of you will be
the winner of this challenge.
And for one of you,
it's curtains.
Now, we're gonna begin
with Tyra.
So these are the curtains
you started with.
<i>- I would have liked</i>
<i>to have seen</i>
<i>just a little more originality.</i>
<i>- I don't mind that it's not</i>
<i>necessarily innovative,</i>
but it is a very classic shape.
- I have a very small criticism,
which is just maybe have a
little more fun with your face.
Smile, more facial expressions.
And remember, it's drag.
So give me face.
- Let's take a look at your
photograph with Mike Ruiz.
What was going through
your mind?
- Pose, but don't fall.
- I disagree.
I think falling on those
two guys
would have been the best thing
that could have happened
that day.
<i>- Shangela, tell us what this</i>
<i>outfit says about you.</i>
- Well, you know, a little fun,
a little rough around the edges,
because I'm fairly new
to the drag world.
- Your bust line
is non-existent.
There's no waist definition
there.
<i>- Wow.</i>
- I think you need to have
a better understanding
of how to relate your face
in a photo shoot situation.
<i>- Morgan McMichaels, what does</i>
<i>your outfit say about you?</i>
<i>- I thought warrior.</i>
<i>- I love it.</i>
<i>I love it because I'm calling</i>
<i>you Chergefani.</i>
You're like a little Cher,
a little Fergie,
a little Gwen Stefani.
- And Cher wore something like
that in her<i> Half Breed</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[imitating Cher]
In<i> Half Breed.</i>
[laughter]
- It reads as a lot
of different things,
and that could have gone
horribly wrong.
But it worked.
- So how much?
[laughter]
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- It's like looking in a</i>
<i>mirror, it really is.</i>
- Kathy, would you say she's
the most beautiful
of all the queens?
- Well, obviously.
[laughter]
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>Now, see, I wish that some</i>
<i>of the energy in this photo,</i>
<i>you could bring to the main</i>
<i>stage in your presentation.</i>
- Here, you're very demure
and girly.
There, you're like belting it
out like Judy Garland
on barbiturates
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> amphetamines!</i>
- Mystique Summers Madison.
- I'm torn about the dress.
Remember, it is the first
impression.
- I may be a big girl,
but I can get down with
the skinny bitches
and wear something short
if I want to.
[laughter]
<i>- Now, is that your breast</i>
<i>coming out?</i>
- Got milk?
[laughter]
- All the humor we're seeing
from you now,
I would loved to have seen
in that picture.
<i>- Yes.</i>
- That's right--
know who you are,
and deliver at all times.
<i>All right, Sahara Davenport.</i>
<i>Your first impression for us.</i>
- Well, my boyfriend's Asian,
so I went with the parasol.
- Well, nothing says Civil War
like my Asian boyfriend.
[laughter]
<i>I love the dress, I just don't</i>
<i>think it's draggy enough.</i>
- I agree; it probably could be
a little more flamboyant.
- I'm a New Yorker.
I'm always on the move.
So I decide to do something
a little more contemporary.
- But, with that said, you know,
this is a drag competition.
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>Well, thank you, ladies.</i>
While the six of you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
<i>Thank you.</i>
Okay, now just between us girls,
we've got a little work to do.
<i>Let's talk about Mystique.</i>
That outfit was raggedy as hell.
<i>I mean, the split was even</i>
<i>raggedy,</i>
<i>but it was entertaining.</i>
- If they were at a drag show
and she did that split,
all the gays would go crazy
and cheer.
Bad dress, though.
- Her humor kind of sells,
like, the raggedy dress.
- Shangela.
<i>- Too old-fashioned looking.</i>
<i>- She had a lot more</i>
<i>personality</i>
<i>in the question and answer part</i>
<i>that the walk.</i>
So she definitely could really
learn how to perform, I think.
<i>- We're not judging potential</i>
<i>a year down the line.</i>
We're picking a drag superstar
today.
- Today.
This is<i> RuPaul's Drag Race;</i>
not RuPaul's School for Girls.
<i>Sahara.</i>
- Chic and wonderful and sweet
and great poses,
but I don't know if she really
has the fabulousness.
- Exactly, you know.
It's all about
the razzle dazzle.
You know, and we didn't really
get to really see that.
<i>- Tyra.</i>
- Beautiful, great visual.
Great dress, great hair,
great makeup.
Where's the personality?
- Wessonality--none whatsoever.
<i>Morgan McMichaels.</i>
- I didn't really get
the fun personality.
- I loved the concept.
Overall, just a really
well-executed look.
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- She was really humorous,</i>
<i>and I thought her look</i>
<i>was great.</i>
<i>- She needs that sort of drag</i>
<i>personality like that.</i>
"I'm taking the stage,
I'm owning it.
I'm here, bitches."
- With that said, silence!
Let's bring the girls...
back in.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
Tyra Sanchez...
The judges loved your look.
But...do you have
the personality
to be the next drag superstar?
Congratulations.
<i>You're safe.</i>
Shangela...you have an
irrepressible energy,
but can energy make up
for a lack of experience?
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're up for elimination.
- I expected to be
in the bottom group.
<i>Now I'm thinking in my head,</i>
<i>let's turn it out.</i>
- Morgan McMichaels, you made
a lasting first impression
with the judges,
and you are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- Thank you very much.
- You will receive immunity
from next week's elimination.
- Yes.
- Plus, you'll be doing a
photo spread
for Interior Illusions
that will be featured in
<i>Lux</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you very much.
- Winning any challenge in this
competition is amazing.
But to win the very first one,
I set myself a high bar.
- Pandora Boxx,
congratulations.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
[applause]
- Mystique Summers Madison.
There is one word
for your outfit.
Raggedy.
But...based on your
unforgettable presentation...
I'm giving you a get out of jail
free card.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
<i>- Pull it together, my dear!</i>
[applause]
- Since I was almost cut, now
I'm gonna work even harder,
because I believe I still could
be the next drag superstar.
- Sahara Davenport.
<i>This pains me.</i>
<i>You're a beautiful doll.</i>
But your personality did not
shine through tonight.
<i>I'm sorry, my dear.</i>
<i>You are up for elimination.</i>
- My heart fills with tears.
It's so crazy,
because I'm here to win,
but, like, I don't want to go
against my friend.
- I expected to be in the bottom
two for this week,
but I did not expect to be going
against Sahara.
<i>Sahara and I went to college</i>
<i>together</i>
<i>and have been friends forever.</i>
<i>- Two queens stand before me.</i>
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
And remember, good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

- [whispering]
Please, you don't have to...
I love you.
- It's a bittersweet moment.
I'm happy that I survived.
But, of course, I'm sad.
You know, I sent my friend home.

But I have a feeling

Good luck, my dear.

If I was to lose to anyone

That was a great experience,

- Big girls are gonna represent
this year.
Fuck them skinny bitches.
- Pandora, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.
Oh, my God.
I'm in a group with, like,
Satan's baby.
I could be a bigger bitch.
- I need money!
My biggest fears in
the competition is my English.
Please help me.
- Raven, during the solo,
you didn't make a lot of money.
- Fuck.
I fucked this up.
- You're up for elimination.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
sashay away.
- Thank you.
Thank you.

Well, howdy, y'all.
<i>The dolls will be gagging on</i>

[alarm beeps]
- Oh, God.
- Oh, wow.
- Not a picnic.
- Oh...
- We're eating something.
- Do we have to eat?
- Oh, Lord.
- As we walked into
the work space,
all I saw was one long table
with ten chairs.
Something is going in my mouth.
I know that much.
- Just hope it ain't
no cherry pie.
- Nicole says, "Be safe, bitch."
- There's more room over here
now.
Coming back into the work room
after Nicole had left
and I had to lip synch
for my life, it felt good
that I had beat her.
Being in the bottom two, bitch?
No.
- I bet that's nerve-racking.
- I did not come here
to lip synch for my life.
I came here to win.
- We love you, Nicole.
- But you got to go.

<i>Cock a doodle doo.</i>
<i>Howdy, racers.</i>
<i>Are you</i>
<i>a coal miner's daughter</i>
<i>or just a boy named Sue?</i>
<i>Well, either way,</i>
<i>for this next challenge,</i>
<i>you best pray that Jesus</i>
<i>takes the wheel.</i>
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>no matter what happens,</i>
<i>I will always love you.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
Well, howdy, y'all.
[cheers and applause]
Well, my, my, my.
Go on, now.
Sit a spell, y'all.
Now, Georgia is where my career
really took off.
I am a country queen at heart.
In those early years,
I had no money.
I would eat anything.
And now that's what
you're gonna do.
[groaning]
- Mystique's gonna finally win
a challenge.
Finally.
- Your mini-challenge
is a taste test
to figure out if what
you're eating is chicken...
or what.
What?!
Or chicken.
Chicken or what?!
The first two queens
to get three points
will be the winners.
Oh, and please put on your
blindfolds.
- Oh.
- No, sir.
- I did not know that this was
gonna be drag<i> Survivor.</i>
- Here is y'all's first course.
Ready?
Let's eat.
- Mm.
Answers please.
The correct answer is "what?!"
They were bull testicles.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Nothing says country cuisine
like bull testicles.
Okay, ladies.
Second course.
Dig in.
It's finger-licking good.
All right.
Answers please.
The correct answer is "what?!"
Mystique has two right.
Morgan has two.
And Pandora has two.
What you just put in your mouth
was soy chicken.
- Oh, okay.
- Isn't so bad.
Third course.
Dig in.
[ominous music]
- Ew.
- I'm thinking that it's, like,
a rat tail or something.
I knew that wasn't chicken,
honey.
- Chicken or what?!
The correct answer is "what?!"
Now, what you just put
in your mouth...
were frog legs.
- Oh!
- Ladies, we have a three-way
tie between Mystique...
- Hell yeah.
- Pandora, and Morgan.
In front of you is a basket of
chicken, rabbit, alligator,
and deep-fried cow brains.
Mm-mm.
The first two queens to finish
everything in their baskets
and show me their empty mouths
will be the winners.
Are you ready?
Dig in.
Melts in your mouth.
Not in your hands.
- I had a plan.
Chew halfway, fill your mouth
with water, swallow.
- Fuck these skinny bitches.
Yummy.
You have to eat everything.
- Hell yeah.
- All right.
Empty mou--all right, she ate
everything.
Mystique is--we have a winner
over here.
- Mystique might as well have
picked up the basket,
opened the hatch,
and just dropped it down.
She was done like that.
- It's down to Pandora
and Morgan McMichaels.
Morgan has two morsels left.
- Swallow, Morgan.
Swallow.
- I took one swallow of
cow brains, and I just ralphed.
- Aah!
- You're still in the game.
You're still in the game.
- Come on, Pandora.
You got it, girl.
You got it.
- We got a second winner
over here.
Morgan McMichaels.
- [belches]
- Congratulations,
Mystique and Morgan.
You're winners, baby,
and the captains for your next
group challenge.
- Congratulations.
- For today's main challenge,
you'll be shooting a commercial
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.
That's Disco--Extra-Greasy.
And you're gonna be selling it
country-queen style.
Okay, Mystique.
Who do you choose?
- Pandora.
- Pandora, come on down.
- Raven.
- West coast.
- West coast.
- Juju.
- Laotian in the house.
- Sahara.
- I was picking strategically.
Other people was probably not.
They was picking friends.
Tatianna.
- Tatianna.
- Sonique.
- So Jessica and Tyra remain.
- Mystique kind of looked at me
like, "Who?"
And I was like,
"Fuck no to Tyra."
- The spicy Latina.
- Jessica.
- It didn't bother me at all.
They saved the best for last.
- Here are two scripts for your
commercials.
One for fried chicken
and one for fried fish fillets.
Mystique, you get to pick one.
- I'll get the closest one...
- All right.
Both commercials have the same
country queen characters.
Your commercials will debut
tomorrow on the main stage.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- We have fried fish fillets.
- Fish?
- I like some fish.
- There's a little concern in
my mind about Mystique leading.
- We're gonna have you as
Disco Critter.
You have this line
and you have that line,
then that's it.
- I picked Jessica because
I didn't want her
to have a part where she has
to actually listen
to everybody mingle in with
everybody.
You don't know that much
English.
- All right.
- Ellie Mae?
- I'm a chameleon, darling.
I can do whatever I need to.
- Aunt Judy Faye,
and Baby Girl.
- Baby Girl.
- Who wants to do
Aunt Judy Faye?
I asked the girls who they felt
they wanted to do.
Then I made the executive
decision.
Do you want to do Ellie Mae?
- Yeah.
- Do you want to do the baby?
- Doesn't matter.
- I think she has more
of a baby face.
- I do too.
- I'll be the baby.
I'll be the baby.
- Everyone wanted to be
something, you know, fun,
something, you know, pretty.
- Disco Critter, do you want
to do that part?
- You're gonna be, like,
a chicken.
- A chicken.
- So I get the Disco Critter,
which is a fucking chicken.
And it really pissed me off.
- Okay, so Raven
has Disco Critter.
Raven is the best makeup artist
in this competition by far.
I knew that Raven would be able
to execute the character
with her personality
and her makeup skills.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be
a fucking chicken.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
Welcome to another home...
- Do you need help
learning that?
- What?
- Do you need help
learning that?
- No, no.
- Okay, okay.
- The girls said,
"We give the chicken
because don't talk a lot."
At the end, I realize
the chicken talk a lot.
Welcome to another
home-fry meal.
- Mystique decides to give
Jessica
the opening and closing
monologues, I'll say.
They weren't just lines.
- Shortening?
- Shortening.
- Shortening?
Shortening.
- Shortenin'.
- Shortenin'.
- I'm kind of scared.
- [groaning]
-<i> Uh, I hope this don't</i>
<i>fall apart.</i>
- The main challenge today
is to put on a commercial
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.
- Oh, Auntie, I just had the
worst day of my life.
- Ellie Mae,
why ya in such a state?
- We only had about three hours
to learn the lines.
- It's that mean
Billie Joe McAllister.
He's been picking on me all day.
My biggest worry for the team
at this time is just getting
the lines in.
Mystique, she's working
double time.
both: Disco Extra-Greasy.
- I think Mystique's doing
a fabulous job.
I am surprised.
I like her a lot.
- Greasy--
- [hissing]
- So are you happy
with who you picked?
- Yes. I think
this is the best team.
Mystique, she fucking swallowed
that basket like the only one.
- She took the basket
and went "gulp."
- Words are words.
People think words don't hurt
'cause they're just words,
but when you hear it
every day...
Fuck everybody else.
- Okay, everybody.
One more time.
Go ahead, Jessica.
- Anna Grain--
Grain Annie?
- Granny.
- "Granny ain't," right?
- No, Granny's separate.
Granny is just one person.
- Oh, Aunt Judy.
Always in my life, when I want
something, it's not easy,
but I am going to keep going,
and I am going to work.
- Howdy.
all: Howdy-do, Ru?
- So this is the McCoys,
isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.
- The Real McCoys.
You think you know your lines?
- Yes.
- I'd love to hear 'em.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal,
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
- Auntie, what's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Why, it's so delicious.
- And crispy too.
- And crispy too!
- Now, McCoys,
what's your biggest concern
going into this challenge?
- My group from the previous
challenge was in the bottom.
- Right.
- And now that I'm team leader,
I don't want my group to be
in the bottom.
I'm up on the chopping block.
If I'm in the bottom group,
then I'm up for elimination.
You know?
And I think the person in charge
should be...
- Are you basing your characters
on people
in real life or television?
- My mom.
I'm just kidding.
- Is it a sexy Disco Critter?
- It's a fun, funky, fresh,
and country Disco Critter.
But it's gonna be more
of, like, a...
I guess you could say a--
a chicken.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a chicken.
There's no way
to make this pretty.
- All right, McCoys, well,
carry on.
I'll let you finish
getting ready.
- I'm really confident.
I think we're gonna win.
- Well, hello, Hatfields.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi!
- Come on over and talk to me.
I want to hear about
your characterizations.
Now, I asked the other kids
to do an impromptu
table reading.
You think you're prepared enough
to do one for me?
- I'm not ready.
- And action.
- Welcome to another m--
Ugh.
Welcome to another fried, hot,
meal.
The...
Ooh.
- It's that
Billie Joe McAllister.
He...
He says I like fish.
- Every Hatfield woman does.
She does,
and there's another line.
Ain't that right, Granny?
- That's right.
We all love fish.
- I don't know if it was just
the pressure of doing it
in front of RuPaul, but it just
really just flopped.
- Still a little bit
underprepared for the challenge.
Jessica, did you choose
your role,
or was your role assigned
to you?
- No, my leader.
- And you chose Jessica
to have a role
with so many lines because...
- I know she'll turn it out
and have fun with it.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm nervous that if we fail,
I'm gonna go down,
because I'm the captain.
I'm responsible for everything.
- McCoys, can you come over
to this table?
Gather round, kids.
Ladies, in a moment, you'll be
shooting your commercials.
And I'm sending in a pro
to help coach you
with your performances.
You'll be working with
our special guest judge
Kathy Najimy.
- Whoo!
- One last thing.
There's a little twist.
I want you to swap scripts.
So now the Hatfields
will be the McCoys,
and the McCoys will be
the Hatfields.
- She switches
the fucking scripts.
- Sorry for the last-minute
change, but that's showbiz.
- We're definitely gagging.
- Don't fuck it up, y'all.
Bye.
all: Bye.
- It really pissed me off.
Because we're now having
to not only
learn new lines
but get dressed.
Oh.
- Here we go.
Let's start again.
- This is gonna separate
the girls from the women, honey.
- It's time for Team McCoy
to do our commercial.
We look ugly, fabulous,
and we're owning it.
- Oh, how "purdy" you are.
Of course you know Kathy Najimy.
- Hi.
- She will be directing
the commercial for you all.
- All right,
we're gonna kick butt
on this, okay, you guys?
- I can't believe
she's standing
in the same room that I'm in.
I'm just--I just want to pee
everywhere, just soak myself.
- Here we go, people.
- I am going to feel that I am
a<i> pollo,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
so the chicken enter fierce.
- Take one.
- Hi!
Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening!
- Cut.
That was great.
Go a little slower,
'cause we really
want to understand
what you're saying. Okay.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal!
- Wait, can you stop?
Can we cut?
Can you--
is it "home-fried male"?
Is it "home-fried male"?
- Home-fried meal.
- Meal. Okay.
-<i> Comida!</i>
- Thought she was gonna
fry up a boy.
- Hi!
Welcome to another
home-fried meal!
- Howdy, Auntie.
What's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Is it a Tic Tac?
- Cut.
Ellie Mae--everything she's
saying
should be sex, sex, sex,
even though she's saying
something else.
- What's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Auntie, I want you to chain
smoke through the whole thing.
- It's Granny McCoy's famous
fried chicken.
- Cut.
Lots of energy, people.
- What is it, Auntie?
- Oh, please tell her.
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.
When I'm on stage performing,
I tend to use my body a lot,
and this was all face.
That Ellie Mae's dumber than
a box of rocks, ain't she?
- Baby, can you make a tiny bit
of a more baby voice?
- Like this?
- Yeah.
- Oh, please tell her.
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.
- I lost my line.
Okay, I got it. I got it.
I got it.
- And go.
Action.
- Shit.
I really did lose it this time.
Wait. Hold on.
- We just need
to pick up the speed.
We only have 30 minutes.
- My secret ingredient
is Disco Greasy Shortening.
- And cut.
- That's a real moment
that she could take.
- Yeah.
Grandma, when she says
"something special,"
give me a little of this.
Like, "Of course
you got something special."
- That's the same age I was
when I won your cousin's heart
thanks to Granny's
special ingredient.
- Cut.
- Granny didn't beam with pride
when...
- When I said the thing,
which is the third time.
Does not take direction well.
Grandma, if you don't
turn your head
when they say
"special ingredient,"
I'm gonna run through this thing
and turn it for you.
You have a minute to show
America who your characters are,
so you have to really
pump 'em up.
- I'm super stoked.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
- Cut.
Critter, we need more energy
and comedy from you, 'cause you
are in a chicken outfit,
but you're doing a very--
sort of a Meryl Streep thing.
Let's think of a chicken voice.
- I'm thinking the whole time
country accent, Southern accent,
and then I'm told,
"Don't do that;
sound like a chicken."
Welcome to another fun-filled
evening--oh, shit.
- Exit and come on again.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another--
oh, shit.
I think I could sell ice
to an Eskimo
but not dressed as
a fucking chicken.
- Chicken, did you do your own
makeup?
'Cause you look a little like
the Joker.
It's scaring me a little bit.
I always like the funny.
- I realize that you're
directing us,
but at the same time, like,
make it seem a little more fun.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco's Extra--
- Cut. Disco.
Remember,
the money is "Disco."
- Every take, they were telling
her to be energetic,
be energetic.
They should only
have to tell you one time.
- [imitating crying]
- Oh, what's happening?
- Oh, Auntie--
- Cut.
Ellie Mae, when you're
coming in, it's--
I feel like you just saw
an alien
or there's something crawling up
your bottom.
Ellie Mae, she's just all sex
and sad
but not totally freaked out.
- Sexy sad.
- Sexy sad.
And you are the sexiest thing
in the world, right?
You know how to do that.
- Oh, Auntie.
I just had the worst day ever.
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.
Who's gonna tell her that
she smells like fish?
- 'Course you like eating fish.
All the Hatfield women do.
- Cut.
Auntie, what's your character,
honey?
- She thinks
she's kind of the boss.
- Okay, then more of that.
- Okay.
- And then, Baby,
I was gonna tell you to do
a high voice but don't.
You go lower and deeper
and madder.
It's hilarious.
You're the baby
just out of prison.
I love it.
- [laughs]
- Billie Joe says
it ain't natural
to like fish
so much.
- Well, that's because
he hasn't had a taste
of Granny Hatfield's
fresh fried fish.
- Auntie, meaner and louder.
- Sonique kept falling
in and out of character.
She didn't stay in character
when the cameras were rolling.
- Do it again.
- The quickest way
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
- Especially when I make it
with Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
- Okay, take it back.
Faster, louder,
and, Granny, turn towards me.
You're really funny,
but I want to see you.
Feel it.
You are your characters.
- You should invite Billie Joe
over here
so he can get a taste
of my fish.
- With Disco, you'll get there
in no time.
[record scratches]
- Granny, did you really
just put shortening
in your crotch?
- Morgan--
she wasn't funny at all.
She was crude.
- A little less
with the crotch shots,
just 'cause
it's a family commercial.
Okay, Baby,
don't change a thing.
- He says I like eating fish.
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.
- It is awful good.
both: And crispy too.
- Mmm-mmm!
- Great.
- Good job.
- I'm happy, and I'm confident
with what my team did,
and hopefully the judges
will see that.
- Good work, Hatfields
and McCoys.
Now, as Kathy knows,
in show business,
the last shot of the day
is called the martini shot,
and this is yours.
Please enjoy
some Absolut cocktails.
Now, dolls, you were asked
to bring your best country duds
from home, and tomorrow you'll
get the chance
to wear them
on the main stage.
We'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judge,
country legend Tanya Tucker.
- I love Tanya Tucker.
Her fashion is fierce.
- Whoo!
- The theme of tonight's
runway presentation
is country couture,
country glamour,
country realness.
- The only country I know
is my aunt,
and she's, like,
the most country-est person
in the world.
But she has so many
personalities.
So I'm like,
"I want to give
all the versions of my aunt
in one."
But this isn't country,
right?
- Depends on what kind of
country look you're going for.
- The first time that I ever
did drag in front of my friends
in high school was during
this Halloween party.
I thought I looked sexy, girl,
and then I--yeah, no.
I had, like, this afro on,
balloon boobies.
My best friend--
- You did balloon boobies too?
- I sure did.
- Girl, no, I have never done
drag in high school.
- I did drag in middle school.
- Girl, we know.
You came out the womb
putting on makeup.
- I know.
- Do you feel like a woman,
or do you feel
like a drag queen?
- A little bit of both.
I mean, when you're in drag,
don't--
you don't just feel
like a drag queen.
Sometimes you might feel
a little bit more womanly
one day.
You might feel a little bit
more fierce.
- I feel like a drag queen
when I'm in drag.
- I feel like a performer,
and that's it.
- Girl, your cheeks
are really ashy.
- What, right here?
- Yeah.
- Girl, I haven't dust yet.
- Uh, it's obvious.
You cooking?
- It's on slow roast.
Like that chicken we have.
- Best chicken, Granny.
- It's all in this can.
- She like,
"It's all in this can!"
- The reason
why I started doing drag
is because I always thought
I was cute.
I have never in my life
been told I was cute as a guy.
Never.
Mystique is pretty.
Everybody loves Mystique.
- I look around the room.
I see everybody looks like
a country diva.
And then I see
what Mystique is wearing.
She looks like she's a big girl
going out to a club.
I don't think the hat goes
with the outfit...
- Yeah, I know.
- Personally.
But you're a queen yourself,
so you choose.
Mm-mm.
[RuPaul laughing]
[applause]
- Oh, my Lord.
- Hi, everyone.
Santino, how are you, baby?
- What's that flower you got on?
- I feel like an ice-cold glass
of country-style lemonade.
[laughter]
- Pink lemonade.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have
Miss Tanya Tucker
in the house tonight.
- Whoo!
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, love it.
Hey, Miss Kathy.
- Hello, my darling.
- This week we asked the ladies
to put the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
back in country
as two feuding teams
to shoot a TV commercial for
Disco Extra-Greasy Shortening.
Tonight, they come
to the main stage
decked out in their best
denim and diamond couture.
Judges, are you ready to see
what they turned out?
- Ready.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Sonique.
-<i> Sonique is everything</i>
<i>that I feel on the inside.</i>
<i>When you feel good</i>
<i>on the inside, it shows.</i>
- Wow.
- She's working it.
A little Tanya Tucker.
- Yeah.
- Ooh.
- The devil went down
to Georgia.
Jujubee.
-<i> During my runway,</i>
<i>all I can think about is,</i>
<i>"Mama, you have to hit this."</i>
- She's popping her cherry
again?
- She's popping her cherry
again.
Raven.
- That's so not Raven.
- I know, right?
- Yeah, the Guess girl.
- I've never seen her
so sweet-looking.
-<i> I feel adorable.</i>
<i>Like a cherry</i>
<i>on top of a cupcake.</i>
- The girl next door.
- Well, next door to what?
- Best little whorehouse
in Texas.
[laughter]
- Sahara.
That much leg
should be against the law.
-<i> I'm a dancer, so of course</i>
<i>I'm gonna try</i>
<i>and incorporate that</i>
<i>every chance I get.</i>
<i>A little bootin',</i>
<i>a little shuffle.</i>
- Y'all come back now, ya hear?
All right, Mommy.
-<i> I wanted to do country,</i>
<i>but I wanted it to have</i>
<i>an urban twist.</i>
- It's kind of like Raquel Welch
went to the country.
- Well, you know, it's hard
to keep 'em on the farm
after they've been
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- That's hard.
- Pandora Boxx.
Cowgirl hall of fame.
-<i> I'm feeling like my outfit</i>
<i>is cute and country.</i>
- This ain't her first time at
the rodeo.
- Even cowgirls get the blues.
- Oh.
Jessica Wild.
-<i> I feel good</i>
<i>because I feel sexy.</i>
<i>I feel that</i>
<i>I am in the country.</i>
- Our little Jessica's
growing up.
She's filling out her jeans.
Her Apple Bottom jeans.
Mystique.
Star Jones before the pilates.
-<i> My strategy in the game</i>
<i>is pretty much to stand out.</i>
<i>To be totally different</i>
<i>from everybody else.</i>
<i>So it can work in my favor.</i>
- Yes, yes.
Uh-huh.
And do-si-do, Mama.
Morgan McMichaels.
The look of today's
country girl.
- Kind of new,
romantic country.
-<i> I think there's just</i>
<i>a one-track mind</i>
<i>about what country is.</i>
<i>You don't have to be Podunk</i>
<i>to be country.</i>
- Aren't they gorgeous,
those boots?
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
-<i> I try to give the judges</i>
<i>another side of me every week.</i>
- Whoo!
- Flip off that skirt!
- Whoo!
- I'll change
at the gas station, Mama.
You won't even know.
- Wow.
Oh, yes.
Now she's Super Tyra.
I'll take one in every color.
Hello, my country queens.
Let's take a look
at the world premiere
of your Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening commercial.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
-<i> Howdy, Auntie.</i>
<i>What's for dinner?</i>
-<i> It's your favorite--</i>
<i>Granny McCoy's</i>
<i>famous fried chicken.</i>
-<i> My secret is right in</i>
<i>this can.</i>
-<i> Ain't that Disco Extra-Greasy</i>

-<i> Sure is, Ellie Mae.</i>
-<i> The quickest way to a man's</i>
<i>heart is through his stomach.</i>
-<i> And with Disco</i>
<i>Extra-Greasy Shortening,</i>

-<i> This is so delicious.</i>

Whoo!
- Our commercial was hilarious.
I loved it.
- Let's take a look

-<i> Welcome to another</i>

<i>He been picking on me all day.</i>
<i>He says I like eating fish.</i>
-<i> Poor dumb Ellie Mae.</i>
<i>Who's gonna tell her that</i>

-<i> That's because</i>
<i>he hasn't tried</i>

- So Hatfields, McCoys,
both of your commercials
have highlights
and lowlights.
But I do have a favorite.
And that is...
The McCoys.
Good work.
[applause]
Now this week,
we had you work as teams.
But tonight each of you
will be judged
on your individual performance.
In other words,
no one is safe.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Sonique.
Jujubee.
Morgan McMichaels.
Tatianna.
Sahara Davenport.
You girls, you are safe.
Congratulations.
You may leave the stage.
The five of you represent
the best and the worst
of the week.
Let's begin
our judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raven.
- I did think the performance
was a little
all over the map.
- It was kind of a mixed bag.
I didn't actually know
if you knew
that you were kind of playing
an animal or a chicken.
- Well, when we were practicing,
I didn't realize that
I should do it as a chicken.
- What did you think
you were gonna do it as?
- Well, do the voice
as a chicken.
- Now, Kathy,
you directed Raven in the piece.
- I directed Raven
in the piece.
PS, you look so cute.
I could put you in a smoothie
and drink you.
But I also sense
a real seriousness about you.
Honey, you have to look
around you.
This is just a bowl
full of fun soup.
Lighten up a little bit
and have a good time.
- All right, next up,
Jessica Wild.
Show us your Apple Bottom jeans.
- My Apple Bottom...
- Hey.
- Yeah, I want to mount her.
You are giving thoroughbred
realness today.
[laughter]
- What'd you think of her
as the Disco Critter?
- I thought she did a good job
with your language.
I can barely speak English,
so...
- Put some crispy
in your cock a "doddle" doo!
I love my character
because I love the Muppets,
so I feel like I am a Muppet.
- Thank you, my dear.
Pandora Boxx,
did you make this outfit,
or did you buy it?
- Um, it's bought,
but then I took the fabric
that we had for all the costumes
and added the little lady.
- Ah, crafty.
- I love your outfit.
I love what you did to it.
And it kind of--
kind of reminds me of me.
- Santino.
- Oh.
I'm not gonna be your favorite.
It almost looks like
you're in a child pageant
or something.
I'm thinking, like, you read,
like, 12 or 13,
and then I'm, like--I'm just
kind of creeped out.
- I don't think Pandora
is a fashion girl.
But what I do get all over
from Pandora is comedy.
I thought you were
the funniest person, actually.
- The quickest way
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
- It was definitely fun to do.
It was kind of my element.
- Very funny.
Mystique Summers Madison.
Are you feeling Southern?
- I went with how my friends
back home dressed as,
since they're country.
- Well, I hear
what you're saying,
but it's not really sort of
the country look.
- I want to stand out
by going as
the normal, mall-wear country.
- [laughs]
- As the country girls--where--
where they still can have on
a nice shirt.
- Isn't this the same top
you wore in the challenge,
though?
- Yes, this is a skirt,
a one-piece skirt.
And I made it more updated
with the gauchos
and everything.
- Why the fuck
did you wear that
and try and make up
some bullshit fucking story?
- I love the way you do
your runway.
I thought your runway
was great.
- It almost seems like
you're twirling even more
because you know that your
outfit is not working today.
- When you walked out just now,
I said,
"I totally forgot
that you're not female."
I just thought, "Well, there's
that gorgeous woman."
It's a bummer about the outfit.
That's a bummer.
- Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
Miss Thing.
- I think
some maybe had a hard time
coming up with one outfit.
You came up with three looks
that you gave us.
The only thing
I would ask you is,
when you transform into Tyra,
why doesn't your voice change?
- Well, I can't go higher.
I can try for you.
- What's the highest note
you can hit?
- Happy birthday,
Mr. President.
- Happy birthday, Mr. President.
- That's--that's totally
believable.
- Let's talk about
your commercial.
You played the baby.
- I actually thought about
my own son.
He wakes up
in the middle of the night
out of nowhere and just like,
"Can I have some water?"
And by the time
I get the water
and bring it back to him,
he's asleep again.
- Well, all right.
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you.
[engine starts]
Let's talk about Mystique.
- She's got that
really pretty face.
The only problem I had
was the outfit.
- Yeah.
- So far off the mark.
- Yeah.
- Stood out
in all the wrong ways.
- That outfit--
that was inexcusable.
- Yeah.
- And then having to explain
why...
[laughs]
Not good. Not good.
Okay, so we're gonna go on
over to Tyra.
She's a gorgeous gal.
- Yes.
- She's clearly inventive
with her presentation.
Do you think Tyra's voice
is working against her?
- I think just a little bit.
- She has a very deep voice.
- Because when you look at her,
there's nothing--
I can't see anything wrong.
- Yeah.
Let's talk about Raven.
Didn't do so well
in the commercial.
- I missed the funny.
Obviously
you're in a chicken suit.
That's the first clue
to be funny.
- Raven looked so beautiful
on the runway,
but I thought,
as the Disco Critter,
Jessica did a better job
than Raven did.
- Yes.
Jessica Wild
is from Puerto Rico,
doesn't speak the language
very well,
and she seemed to master
the Disco Critter very well.
- She just went wild.
- I find her really charming
and a great, spicy addition
to this lineup.
- Yes.
- But is she America's
next drag superstar?
That's the question
we have to ask.
- I don't know.
- Pandora Boxx.
Santino had an issue...
- Hate, hate.
- With Pandora Boxx's outfit.
- It's just very just,
uh, pedestrian.
- She is a fantastic comedienne.
- My favorite to work with.
She's got--she's got
some comedy going.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
Ladies, welcome back.
Pandora, if you want to win
this race,
you need to step up your style.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Mystique, you were slow
to make adjustments on set
during the commercial.
When we asked you to give us
your best country couture,
you came up empty-handed.
I'm sorry.
You're up for elimination.
- I knew this was probably
gonna happen this way.
They didn't see me as
their version
of country realness.
You can't please everybody.
- Jessica.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Raven.
I see flashes of star power
in you.
But as quickly as it comes,
it fades away.
Do you have the consistency
to be the next
drag superstar?
I'm sorry, but you're up for
elimination.
- So once again
I'm in the bottom two.
Honestly, I don't feel like
I belong in the bottom two
with Mystique.
- Tyra Sanchez,
your runway was a hit.
And your Baby Girl
made me laugh out loud.
Congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Which means you have immunity
next week.
Plus you'll receive a collection
of designer bags,
handmade in Italian leather,
from M. Clifford Designs.
Congratulations, Tyra.
You may join the other girls.
- This is the first challenge
that I won,
and I feel great.
I feel amazing.
Because last week they were
making me out
to be a bitch of the group.
And I'm not a bitch.
I'm America's sweetheart.
- Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges.
But the final decision
is mine to make.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you
to lip synch for your life.
Good luck, and remember...
Don't fuck it up.

I've made my decision.
Raven, you've been

But you keep pulling through.
And it's that kind of resilience
it takes to win this race.
Shante.
You stay.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
If I was told to sashay away
and Mystique is still standing
up there,
I would have
fucking slit my wrists.
- Mystique Summers Madison,
I want you to believe
in yourself, because I do.
Now sashay away.
[laughter]
- Got it, girl.
Good job.
-<i> I'm not gonna change</i>

I'm gonna be Mystique.

- Dolls, like every good
country song,
we will live through
this heartache.
Mystique is gone,
but we will carry on
in the tradition
of all great country queens.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- Let the music play!
[dance music]

-<i> Previously on</i>
Rupaul's Drag Race...
- Hey!
[all screaming]
- Sahara and I have
been friends forever.
- I hope that I don't fall
into that role of babysitting
when I should be really, like,
cutting their bra straps.
- You must create
your best drag look
using just these curtains.
Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
You have a child?
- I do have a son.
My son is, like,
my major motivation
for winning this competition.
- All right!
She is throwing
some serious 'shay.
Morgan McMichaels, you are
the winner of this challenge.
You will receive immunity.
- I don't fucking
like being just safe.
- Mystique, based on your
unforgettable presentation,
I'm giving you
a get out of jail free card.
Sahara Davenport, Shangela,
the time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.
- Ohh!
- Sahara Davenport,
Shante, you stay.
Shangela, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
today, I'm gonna
give you a chance
to street walk
a mile in my shoes.
<i>Wigs will fly.</i>
- You stuck me with these
fuckin' bitches.

- I think we might be
in trouble.
- Help me.

[alarm clock beeping]
- Walking into the workroom
this morning
was a little weird 'cause we
didn't have Shangela with us.
- Sahara?
- Yes, darling?
- Here's Shangela's face.
- Ohh!
What am I gonna do with it?
I'm trying to take the attitude
that it's a clean slate.
Trying not to have the weight
of what happened the other night
on my shoulders.
She's gone,
so we won't need this anymore.
This is now my station, guys.
[siren wails]
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>

<i>All right?</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
- Make it rain.
- Rain?
- Hey, girls.
[cheers and applause]
Now, today I'm gonna
give you a chance
to street walk
a mile in my shoes.
Oh, dear!
Today's mini-challenge
is a makeover,
where you'll be turning
a lady into a tramp.
The lady in question is me.
[gasps and laughter]
Or, as I like to say, mini-Ru.
[laughter and applause]
Now, as you girls see, there are
only six supermodel dolls,
so you'll be working in pairs.
And there's
an odd number of you,
which means one person
will be working alone.
Now take a moment
to choose a partner.
- We'll do it together.
- The Atlanta girls
are working together?
- Let's do it?
- Hell, yeah.
- Raven and Morgan?
- New York!
- New York?
Okay, yeah.
Tyra and Jujubee.
Jessica and Tatianna.
- I'm alone.
- Mystique works alone.
- Always.
- Ladies, you'll have
30 minutes for your makeover.
Feel free to use the materials
we've provided.
Now, when I return,
I want to see
these little ladies turned
into six bad girls
that work hard for the money,
if you know what I mean.
Are you ready?
Set...
go.
- My number one goal was to grab
the whole plate of fabric.
- Tyra and I ended up
with most of the stuff.
- We had got what we wanted,
and then let everyone
get our sloppy seconds.
- We did not get left nothing.
I got, like,
one handful of scraps.
Oh, my God!
- 30 minutes, bitch.
- Okay.
- I think her heel
should be broken.
- [laughs] Definitely, yeah.
- What about these boots?
- I think she needs
hooker heels.
- But I seen hookers
out there with boots on.
- I love working with Tyra,
but sometimes he just kind of
wants to do
what Tyra wants to do.
- The purse should
match the shoes.
- No, it shouldn't match
the shoes, diva.
- These are not heels.
These are rhinestones.
- She's tucked real good.
[laughing]
I think what I'm gonna
miss most being here
and not in Atlanta is
the fact that I won't be able
to spend day-to-day time
with my son, Lucas,
who's 3 1/2, and I miss him.
We play every day.
- Hello, dolly.
- Uh-oh!
- Wow! [laughs]
- Where's the glitter?
Where's the glitter?
Where's the glitter?
- You use all my glitter.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- You tramp.
- Work.
- Glue these shoes on.
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
It is time to reveal
your makeovers.
- I got Shaquanda here.
- Uh-huh.
I call her
a broke-down stripper.
When she want to be naughty,
all you got to do
is turn her around,
she's ready for access.
- Hey!
- With her nice little
rose tattoo.
- Tatianna and Jessica.
- This is both of us.
She's got my eyes, but her lips.
- What is this doll's name?
- Wild Whore.
- [laughing]
- Wild Whore.
- Pandora and Sahara.
- Our girl is called
Shafreeforal.
She's had a little bit
of a rough night.
She has lost her shoe.
[RuPaul laughing]
- Her other heel is broken,
but she still has
the heel in her hand.
She hasn't lost it.
- It's her good shoe.
- Yes.
- Sonique
and Nicole Paige Brooks.
- Well, you said
it could be a bad girl,
so the baddest bitch we know
is my drag mother
Shawna Brooks,
so she's styled after her.
- Wow, look at that.
- Yes, with the matching boots,
and always one titty out.
- Tyra and Jujubee.
- This is Cherry.
- Oh, Cherry.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, wow.
- And she has one tooth missin'.
- That's okay, girl.
Is that a skirt?
- Um, it's a skort.
- Look, she is dealin'
crack back here.
- More hair to comb,
more cheeks to powder.
That's all it is.
- That's right.
That's what we tell her.
- Morgan and Raven?
- This is Lady Mayhem
from the House of Chaos.
- Gorgeous,
look how cute that is.
- Just a little, tiny thong
with a nice sequined strap.
- All right, ladies,
that was quite the show.
The winning team is...
Pandora Boxx
and Sahara Davenport.
[applause]
Miss Shafreeforal.
- Shafreeforal won!
- Congratulations, girls.
Now, this week's
main stage challenge
is inspired by my feature film
<i>Starrbooty,</i>
where I play
an undercover hustler.
Word, holla, hey!
And a diva is a female version
of a hustler.
This is your chance to unleash
your inner pussycat doll
and to show us that you can use
your brains and your beauty
to make it rain.
In two teams,
you'll be competing
as burlesque dancers.
You'll be judged on your ability
to work as an individual
and in a group.
Pandora, Sahara, since you won
the mini-challenge,
you are team captains.
Pandora, who do you pick first?
- Uh, Morgan.
- Ooh, yay.
- Sahara?
- Jessica.
- Jessica!
- Sonique.
- Jujubee.
- Raven.
- They was going after the girls
who are skinny
and go out there naked.
I'm not all, "Oh, my God,
they didn't pick me,"
cry, cry, cry.
No, it's not my personality.
This ain't high school.
- Tyra.
- Tyra?
- I wanted to be
in Pandora's group.
She had all the tall,
skinny, pretty bitches.
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna!
[applause]
Sahara, your choice.
- We're gonna go with Mystique.
- It's all about the titties.
- And that leaves
Nicole Paige Brooks.
- Save the best for last.
I was picked last, which I was
really surprised about,
to be honest.
- Nicole was left last
because this is a sexy contest,
and she's not sexy.
- In a moment, you'll meet
two top burlesque performers.
They're gonna give you
a crash course
in pole dancing,
with poles provided
by Platinum Stages,
plus each team
will be responsible
for styling
your burlesque outfits,
using materials courtesy of
Michael Levine Fabrics.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman...
win!
- We're gonna go with one print
'cause they don't match.
- I know they don't speak,
but it fits.
A girl in this on stage,
a girl in this, a girl in this,
a girl in this, and then another
girl in that,
and then that'll go fine.
You get what I'm sayin'?
- I don't like that.
I want us all to be in the same.
We're gonna all be in the same.
- Guys, we really need
to work as a team,
'cause I'm gonna
get frustrated.
Tyra's being difficult.
"I want this, I want this,"
it's all about her.
- Can I say something,
team captain?
- Sure. What is it, darling?
- This red fabric
that you chose?
- Uh-huh?
- It's shitty.
Like, really shitty.
- Tyra!
- Do you guys need a extra
person in your group?
- We're tired of all
your bitching out there.
- Pandora?
- Yeah?
- Do you not like me?
You didn't choose me
to be in your group.
I was hoping and praying
that you would choose me.
- I'm sorry.
- Now, look, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.
- Oh, my God, I am in a group
with, like, Satan's baby.
- Our challenge
is to create a burlesque act.
We're getting
pole-dancing lessons.
- Today, we're going to be
teaching you a few basic tricks.
- Oh, Lord.
[laughing]
Here we go.
- Gorgeous.
[applause]
There was a lot of vagina
in my face. [laughs]
I was like...
- Ladies, this is dropping it
like it's hot.
- Oh, my God!
- How do expect me to do that?
It doesn't move on me.
- Well, so who wants
to get started?
Any volunteers?
- La-la-la-la-la!
I'm a flexible bitch
that can drop it like it's hot.
We gonna get on the pole
and do a upside down butterfly,
just have fun with it.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ohh!
- Wow!
- Very good.
- Whoo!
- Wow!
[applause]
- [laughs]
That ain't sexy.
I want to try that again.
Your titties
are distracting me.
- I'm sorry. They--
that's what they're there for.
- Nicole is really sexy
and really sexual,
so I'm not really worried
about being, you know,
a tease,
'cause it's kind of what I do.
- Release and spin.
Much better!
Very good.
See?
That was awesome.
- Nicole cannot bring sexy back.
- Anybody else?
Come on, girl.
- Tyra, go.
- I can't.
- Oh, Tyra, go.
- I cannot do that.
- You have to do something.
- The way that I learn
is by watching others do it.
I'm not going to get up there
and just use
someone else's ideas.
- I'm the group leader,
and we all know
that the group leader's
the first one to go down,
so I am just hoping and praying
that everyone pulls through,
especially Miss Tyra.
Now how you guys feel
about the dancing?
Are y'all gonna be
okay with that?
- I feel like a whore slut.
- Is that a bad thing?
- Yes, that's a bad thing.
- But you're a bad girl,
remember?
- But I'm a bad girl,
I'm not a bad slut.
I feel that pole dancing, um,
it's kind of a little ho'-ish.
- I think we should just be
very positive about it,
and then it'll all come
together.
- It's fine,
as long as everyone cooperates.
There's no "I" in "team,"
after all, right?
- But there's a "me," girl.
- So far, I'm not quite clickin'
with the choreography,
just 'cause I want someone
to really, like,
slow it down for me so I get it.
- Pandora's just kind of
standing off to the side.
She's not really doing much,
so I tell Morgan,
"Girl, you should
choreograph this."
- I'm not trying to be bitchy,
but if you want, like,
choreography done,
like, let us do it.
There was a lot
of confusion going on,
and the time was
running out.
- I'm not reading you, by any
means, but you know what I mean?
Like, it's so confusing.
- Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying
to set it up at the beginning,
that's it.
- I went into shut-down mode
for a little bit,
because everybody
was just talking,
and it was very frustrating
and irritating.
I was like, "Oh, Christ."
- The two weakest people
should be in the back.
- Yeah.
- That's just an opinion.
- Okay, well,
let's just practice this,
and then as we figure out
who the weakest is
we'll move 'em around.
- Okay, let's try this.
Ready?
- I could be a bigger bitch.
- So can I, girl.
Miss Tyra decides that she
can't rehearse in heels.
- Are you gonna have me
rehearse like this?
You're gonna have me complainin'
about my feet hurtin'.
I know how my body works.
- Five, six, seven, eight...
- I'm just sitting back.
I'm puttin' everything
together in my head.
I'm sayin', okay, girl,
do this and do that.
Like if they asked me now,
"Girl, do the routine,"
I would do it,
and I'd do it better
than what they did in there.
- We need to pick a color
that's gonna work.
- Well, if they're
not using this,
I think we should use this.
It's the most colorful,
and it's just sitting here.
- Do we need
to find out for sure
if they're not using that?
- No.
- No, they said they're done.
- 'Cause they're doing
that right there.
- This'll be hot.
- I think this is gonna pop
with black, I really do.
- Hey, that's our fabric.
She just took all our fabric.
- Because it's our fabric,
honey.
- I could have swore
you guys said
you were done with your fabric.
- No, we had all our fabric
over here that we were using.
Sorry you misunderstood.
- No, there was
no misunderstanding.
I have ears,
and they hear very well.
- No one's here to share.
We're not here to help.
We're not even here
to be friends.
- Did you need this fabric?
Well, do you need it,
or do you not need it?
- Hey.
- You owe me one.
- Thank you, darling.
- Cute, by the way.
I love them.
- Are you tryin' to be
fierce to me, Miss Tati?
- No!
I think they're cute.
- Just makin' sure, girl.
Just makin' sure.
- You think a lot, don't you?
But you think wrong
all the time.
- I do.
- You should think harder.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Hello, hello, hello.
Wow, look at this.
How's it going so far?
- I think it's going good.
- And do you feel like
you're really the leader?
- Um, I didn't
at a certain point, no.
I think that there's just
a lot of strong personalities.
- Really? Here?
- Just a few.
- Among drag queens?
- Do you feel as though
you've been an effective leader
for your team?
- Most definitely.
I think the end result
will show that as well.
- So you're okay that
one of your team members
is over there sleeping?
Are you worried?
- I am worried.
I am worried.
- Mm-hmm.
- What am I to do?
- Well, it's, you know,
hard out there for a pimp.
- Don't wake her up.
She'll scream.
- Tyra, sweetie.
Darling?
Sweetie pie.
- Tired.
- You're tired?
- Yeah.
- Why you so tired?
- I don't know.
When Ru woke me up,
I'm like, "Shit!"
- Now, why do you think
everybody else is so busy,
but you have time to nap?
- Um, they're hot-gluing.
- Uh-huh.
- And I sewed, and it took me,
like, five minutes
to make my costume.
- You know,
you will be judged on
not only your individual,
but how well you work
with the group.
- I'm good.
I'm perfectly fine.
I don't have any doubt.
- All right, get back to bed.
All right, girls,
one last thing before I go.
Now, I'm gonna take you all
on a little field trip tomorrow
to Dragonfly.
It's a hot Hollywood club,
where you'll be performing
your main challenge
in front of an audience
of 100% grade "A" men.
Beef, honey. Beef.
Now, I want you to make sure
to bring your charisma,
uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Bye, y'all.
See ya.
[applause]
- I'm excited to get out
and it be a room full of men.
I can't fucking wait.
- Hey, girls,
welcome to Dragonfly.
This week,
Santino, Merle, and I
are joined by our
special guest judges,
one of my favorite funny ladies,
Kim Coles is here.
[applause]
And our extra
special guest judge,
the queen of burlesque,
Dita Von Teese.
[cheers and applause]
Now, in a moment, the team
that makes the most money
will be safe
from elimination this week,
and the girl on that team
who earns the most
will be the winner,
but first, what would
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> be</i>
without a little twist?
Today, you'll have two ways
to earn those dollars, honey.
While one team is working on
this stage,
the other will be
selling it on the street.
You hear that, Tyra?
Not you.
I'm talkin' about Tyra Banks.
[laughter]
- I hate goin' out the door
in drag in the daytime.
- And by "it," I mean cherry pie
gift certificates.
Cherry pie
gift certificates, sir,
courtesy of Cafe Audrey.
And one more thing.
Don't fuck it up.
- We have 60 minutes to sell
some cherry pie
gift certificates.
Help me out, buy some pie.
Team strategy is to get
out there and sell, sell, sell.
- Hi, would you like
to buy a cherry pie?
- Please, please,
don't make me beg.
- Please!
I need money!
- Does anybody want cherry pie
gift certificates, $5.
I don't know how
to approach people.
No?
Do you understand me?
Can you hear--
am I here?
Anybody?
Bueller?
- Buy the pie, baby.
Buy the pie. Please buy the pie.
- I think we might be
in trouble.
- Please help me.
- We're confident.
We're the pretty girls.
We're gonna sell sex, and isn't
that the name of the game?
- Nicole was having difficulty
with the choreography.
Big and messy
is not gonna cut it.
[cheers and applause]
[applause]
- I made a lot of money.
It rained on me a few times,
and I like to be wet.
- While I'm on stage,
I'm so incredibly nervous.
My heart is going
"Whum, whum, whum."
I feel like my boob's
gonna pop right out.
[cheers and applause]
- And as you pick up
crumpled money,
it looks like a lot more
than it is.
I realize it didn't rain.
It was enough to buy
a nice dinner
at the sizzler or something.
- Cherry pie.
all: Cherry pie!
Cherry pie!
- Oh!
Also I can do that for you.
- I got a dollar.
- Thank you, yay!
- Here's one dollar.
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Ooh.
Watch your--
think soprano, though,
when you talk, girl.
- Hi, would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
We got cherry pie
gift certificates!
- Tyra's surprising me,
actually.
I'm like, wow,
she actually has a personality?
- Hi. Would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
- $5--
thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, okay.
- I looked like a $2 whore.
My grandmother's gonna kill me.
What you want?
- Let me see you guys
do a dance for this $20.
- Okay.
- I see her from the corner
with a $20 bill,
and I'm like, "Wait!
That's mine."
- Oh, yes!
- Miss Sahara, you stealin'
this sale from me, girl?
- The audience really
kind of got into it.
[cheers]
- They were all loving it,
eating out of
the palm of my hand.
I felt kind of like
I might have been
the skankiest on stage.
- I'm a nervous wreck
being in front of Dita.
She's the epitome of burlesque,
and there she is,
lookin' at you, you
know, judgin' you.
- We went out onto
Hollywood Boulevard,
and we're trying to sell
these gift certificates,
and there's Christians
and children and--oh.
I'm not cut out for this.
- You know you want
a taste of cherry pie.
- Nicole was loud.
- I'm serious, it's right there.
You're almost at Audrey's.
You know you want the pie.
- Raven, I always just kind of
saw her standing like a statue.
- You guys want to buy
cherry pie.
I can tell you love cherry pie.
- Sonique is rude.
- How much money do you have?
- Uh...
- Yes?
- Uh, well, I have some--
- You're wasting my time.
I got an hour.
- My time is expensive, too.
- All right, well,
then hit it, 'cause so is mine.
- Hey, daddy.
Nobody wants cherry pie?
- Morgan, she's like,
"Hey, daddy."
La-la-la-la.
- We like pie.
Do you like pie?
- Cherry.
- Cherry pie.
- I don't like
to carry myself like that.
I'm sweet in the streets
and, you know,
a freak in the sheets.
- Cherry...
pie.
- I look over at the judges,
and Dita Von Teese
was smiling, honey.
You can't crack her.
She sits there with this just
straight face, just beauty.
- All of our arguing
and bitching
and nagging at each other,
like, finally paid off.
- I feel excited.
I'm going to work that crowd.
- Whoo!
- Ow!
- I think I did a great job,
because I have a lot of money.
- Yeah!
- My strategy for my solo
is just to wow the crowd.
[cheers]
- Sellin' cherry pie.
Come and get it.
- Hello.
I love your hat.
- [pretending to cry]
Please, somebody buy cherry pie.
They just were running, running.
- You guys like cherry pie?
- He's running.
He's running from somebody.
They're like,
"Aah! It's a t-girl!
It's a t-girl!"
- Because I can't dance,
I figured I'd be sexual
and playful.
Every girl needs lip gloss,
right?
[cheers and applause]
- I'm thinking, do whatever it
takes to get your money.
[cheers]
[kicks stage]
- My strategy is to demand money
from the men.
- I hope it pays off.
- Ow!
- [sighs]
Are you tired?
- Very much so.
- Elimination day is today.
Everyone's on pins and needles
because no one knows
how to measure
the other team's work,
so we're just anxious
to see who's on the bottom.
- Somebody stole
my mommy's picture.
I walk in the room,
and, you know,
first thing I'm thinkin' is,
got to say hello to Shawna,
my drag mother,
and she's not on the wall.
I've been robbed!
If anybody sees a 8x10
of Shawna Brooks,
maybe it got set
on their station by accident,
'cause it was on this wall
yesterday and now it's gone.
Being away from my family
was more than
I thought it was, you know?
I have a 2 1/2-year-old, Lucas.
He's at home,
and I miss him the most.
- Are y'all gonna
let him watch the show?
- When he's, like,
four or five maybe.
Hopefully, there'll be
an appropriate one to show him.
I'm just hopin'
that he's proud of his life.
Gonna be able to show him
I am at the top of my game.
He should be proud of what
his daddy does for a living.
He's gonna be able to say,
"My daddy's a drag superstar."
[laughs] You know?
- You guys still have
all your fathers, yeah?
- My father has cancer
right now, so...
- Oh! Mine--
mine passed away of cancer.
He had lung cancer.
- I don't really know--
I mean, we don't know
how long he has.
My father was just diagnosed
with cancer.
He's, you know, on chemo
and going through all of that.
- My father was always
just really upset about it,
because he knew
he was gonna die,
and he didn't know how we were
gonna take care of ourselves.
- So sad.
- Yeah, I mean, it is,
but just this, Pandora.
Just tell him you love him.
That's all.
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.
- I don't, either.
I gotta put makeup on,
and I don't want it to smudge.
- Yeah, okay.
-There's a lot
of mixed emotions.
There's a lot of feelings
going on around the room.
People are wondering
which group's gonna be
up on the chopping block,
but still,
at the same time trying to hurry
and get ready
for the main stage.
[applause]
- Well, hello, judges.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Have you recovered
from yesterday?
- That was insane.
- Oh!
- I thought it was fantastic.
- I enjoyed it very much.
- I wish my whole life
could be that.
- You wish your--
- I do. I do.
- Now, this week, the girls
were split into two teams
of burlesque dancers to see
who could earn the most dollars
dancing for tips and hustling
with cherry pie gift
certificates.
Tonight, I've asked them
to come decked out
in their high-class drag.
Are you ready, judges?
- Yes.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen...
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Sonique-a-nique-a-nique-a.
Oh, she's making a Sonique boom.
[laughter]
- With the lights goin'
and the music goin',
it was perfect,
so I hope they think I did good,
because I felt like
I did pretty good.
- Yes, ma'am, sell the garment.
Oh, my, this dress is wicked.
Are you a good witch
or are you a bad witch?
- When I head up my runway
and I feel like a diva.
- Almost looks like
toilet paper cozy.
[laughter]
In a couture sort of
toilet paper cozy kind of way.
- [gasps]
Wow, dark lady.
- She will take your man, honey.
- Yes, she will.
- I wanted to do something
simple that I could dress up.
I know I look fierce.
- I'm callin' that Cher 2010.
- Yes.
- Sahara, oh!
Stop in the name of love.
- [laughing]
- I feel great.
I'm sparkling,
the judges are smiling.
- Bob Mackie would be proud.
- I'm just livin', honey.
- Pandora Boxx.
- The shoes match the dress
kind of like the carpet
and the drapes.
- Yes!
- I like that dress because
it's a little bit different,
and I really thought that
it would make me stand out.
- Very L.A.
I came out to L.A.
to be an actress-slash-model.
- Actress-slash-model.
- Jujubee!
Is this a hostile takeover?
[laughter]
- I felt like Eartha Kitt.
I'm servin' fish, honey,
and this ain't trout.
- Jujubee Fabulous!
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- She looks like Courtney Cox.
- I looked like a real girl.
I looked like a model
on the runway,
which anybody wants me to model
their dress, sign me up.
I'll be more than happy
to do it.
- Yes, mama!
- Mystique Summers Madison.
Girl, your pussy is on fire!
- Oh!
- My outfit for the runway
is a nice, simple kind of
evening gownish,
'cause I'm a gown bitch.
- That girl will eat Beyoncé
in one swallow.
- [laughing]
- And she is telling you,
"I'm not going!"
- Send me Morgan McMichaels
from the secretarial pool.
- I didn't want to wear a gown.
That's boring to me when
everybody else is doing it.
- Oh, executive realness.
- [laughs]
Executive realness.
- Oh, my sweet gherkins!
There's a new Tyra in town.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
- I know I looked good today,
because it was elegant,
it was over the top,
and it was still drag.
It gave you everything
you needed.
- I love the nappy pompadour.
- Yes, mama.
Tatianna Von Furstberg
Zeta-Jones!
- [laughing]
- She's giving Galliano
realness, yes.
- The look I'm going for
is Rihanna going to prom,
so I did the little
Rihanna bob with it.
I'm feeling pretty confident.
- Very real.
Ladies, it's time to reveal
which team made the most money
and is safe from elimination.
And the winning team is...
Sahara Davenport's team.
[applause]
Congratulations.
You're all safe.
The winner of this challenge
is...
Sahara Davenport.
[applause]
In addition to immunity
next week,
you've won a $1,500
gift certificate
from sequinqueen.Com.
Thank you, ladies.
Now you may leave the stage.
[applause]
Pandora Boxx, your team is up
for elimination.
What went wrong?
- I think maybe we just
didn't work the crowd enough
or something.
Now, let's talk about
your presentation
on the main stage today.
- I'm not loving
the overall look.
Visually, though, I thought
maybe you could have
pulled the parts together
a little better.
- This dress is not my favorite,
either.
I'm not a fan of the bands.
It kind of looked--
at first, I thought,
what was it, duct tape?
[Santino laughing]
- Thank you, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, now, you really
made it rain on the stage,
but you came off
a little bit rude
on the street.
- My time is expensive, too.
- All right, well, then hit it.
- I was rude to, like,
one or two people,
but, I'm sorry,
it was hot out there.
I was in a hurry.
I was trying to raise
as much money as I could.
It was a challenge. You would
do the same thing, right?
- I do sassy,
I don't do bitchy.
Nicole Paige Brooks.
Now what are you serving
on the main stage?
- This was actually just
a backup that I brought,
because the first gown I had
technical difficulties with.
- I thought, more than anyone
when she walked out,
I was like, "Whoa! Is that
a real girl over there?"
And I like your little Megan Fox
tongue thing that you did,
but don't do it too much
like she does,
or else it loses effect.
- You could have looked like
a young Janice Dickenson,
but it came off
kind of like a drunken
Janice Dickenson at times.
- Ha-ha!
Our next lady is Tatianna,
a vision in purple.
How do you feel your hustler
game came through
on the challenge yesterday?
- I think it worked pretty well.
- One thing I really noticed was
one of the guys
asked your name
when you were done.
Nobody asked
anybody else's name.
They were fallin' in love
out there.
I called you Kim Kardashian
on steroids.
- Ooh, yeah.
- But in a good way.
- Yeah.
- In a good way.
Kim wished she looked that good.
- Raven, doin' the solo.
You didn't make
a lot of money there.
- No, I didn't.
When I started seeing
the other girls come back,
I thought, "Fuck,
I fucked this up."
- What would you
have done differently,
knowing how it went?
- I wouldn't have moved as much.
I would have gone
to the edge of the stage,
laid out, and let them
just throw the paper on me.
- Lady ATM.
[Santino laughing]
- You're very femme fatale.
I was a little bit scared.
I would not leave my man
in a room alone with you.
- Don't do it.
I'll work it.
[laughter]
- Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes.
- You have immunity.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You know, in a minute,
I'm gonna have to send
someone home.
Who should it be and why?
- The weakest person in the
group, you know, is Tatianna.
- Tatianna, who do you
think should go home today?
- I'm just gonna go with Morgan,
because she has immunity.
- Tatianna, that's an answer
for the Miss America contest,
not the<i> Rupaul Drag Race</i>
contest.
Nicole, same question.
- Send 'em all home.
- Send all these bitches home?
- Ooh!
- Okay.
Send all these bitches home.
- I mean, they eventually
all have to go,
so, I mean, I don't want
to be the one who goes,
so send 'em all.
- Raven, who would you
send home tonight?
- I would say Tatianna.
I don't think she wants to be,
like, a grand, superstar diva.
I think she's comfortable
being a beautiful girl.
- No.
- [laughing]
- Not the case.
If I was comfortable
being a beautiful girl,
I was a beautiful girl at home.
That's not why I'm here,
to be, like, pretty.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Just my opinion.
- All right.
Pandora, who should
I send home tonight?
- I think that the ho that made
the least amount of money
should go home.
But I don't know who that is.
[laughter]
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
Thank you.
[engine starts]
This is the hardest part.
They're all fabulous kids,
but one of them has to go home.
Nicole Paige Brooks brought in
the least amount of dollars,
and Raven was second to last.
Raven seemed like she was
out of her element.
- The performance wasn't
my favorite performance,
but I think today she was
really exciting to watch.
- Had I not talked to her,
she was gonna be my bottom two,
but I like that sense of humor,
I like that little edge.
I'm not ready to see her go yet.
- Right. Now, Tatianna.
She's green.
- When I saw her dancing, I was
like, "She's the prettiest one."
- Do we give her the opportunity
to blossom on this show,
or do we say, "Look, honey,
you got to come prepared."
- She's gorgeous, however,
she didn't know how to make
her disadvantages
her advantages,
and everybody else here does
seem to know how to do that.
- Let's move on to Sonique.
- I definitely sort of sensed
a little, you know,
sort of feminine sweet like,
"I know I was kind of bitchy
to people on the street, but I
won't ever do it again, 'kay?"
- [laughing]
- Pandora was actually one of
the team's top money earners.
- She didn't stand out for me.
- I know you didn't like
her outfit.
- I hated that outfit.
- I equated it to, like, she
just got off the Greyhound bus.
Maybe that worked
to her advantage.
Maybe people like to see that
kind of starving, hungry look.
You know, maybe that's why
she made so much money.
I don't know.
- So she may not give
kind of great ass,
but she gives great sass.
- Yes.
- I just like her
sassy attitude.
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
She got a little lost
in the crowd. Do you agree?
- I do agree.
[imitating steady tone beeping]
That's death
in this competition.
- I kind of like the highs
and the lows.
The kind of bipolar.
To me, that makes life richer.
- Sure.
- And I'm just getting Prozac.
- Silence!
Bring back the girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your<i> Starrbooty-licious</i>
challenge
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,
I have made some decisions.
Morgan McMichaels,
you have immunity this week.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, on stage, the crowd
was turned on by your body,
but on the street, people were
turned off by your mouth.
No one wants a cherry pie
that bites back.
You're safe.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
you brought in
the least amount of money.
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.
- I was surprised I was
the lowest earner of tips.
I really thought that my
exuberance on the street
would have pulled me
out of the bottom.
- Pandora Boxx, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raven, you were the second
lowest earner,
and in a moment, you'll have
a chance to prove yourself.
You're up for elimination.
- When she told me
I was up for elimination,
my knees locked,
my head got dizzy.
I literally thought
I was gonna pass out.
- Tatianna,
sharpen your claws, baby.
It's a jungle out there.
You're safe.
Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip sync
for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
-<i> And now,</i>
<i>it's time for a breakdown.</i>
[laughter]
- Oh, yes!
[cheers and applause]
- I've made my decision.
Raven...
you will live to fly
another day.
Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Nicole Paige Brooks,
you are a fabulous queen.
I send you home to carry on
the fine tradition
of the Atlanta queens
who have come before you.
Now, Sashay...
away.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
The fact that I even
walked through these doors
is overwhelming to me,
and definitely didn't think
I'd be leaving this soon.
I'm ready to go home
and see my baby.
- Ladies,
you know competition is hard.
Ain't no half-steppin', mama.
You have to bring it.
That's what we're here for.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Let the music play!

-<i> Tonight, on RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!,</i>
<i>the superstars</i>
<i>of season two return,</i>
<i>and the fur flies.</i>
- Some of these girls
in the competition
need a personality lift.
- Fuck you too, bitch.
-<i> Watch as my girls dish</i>
<i>a little bit of love...</i>
- Pray for me
and pray for my son.
- That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.
-<i> And a whole lot of shade.</i>
- This woman's gonna cuss me
the [...] out.
[laughing]
- Hey, I'm not done talking yet.
You will speak when I'm done.
- Ooh.
- Security.
-<i> And we announce your choice</i>
<i>for this season's</i>
<i>fabulous Las Vegas</i>
<i>Miss Congeniality Award.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>
[car engines racing]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i>
People are always asking,
"RuPaul, what's the secret
to the show's success?"
Well, the answer is simple.
It's magic.
Before your very eyes,
12 supernatural men turn
into bewitching beauties
and do things that mere mortals
can only dream about.
Why, these drag queens
are just plain wicked.
And they got more tricks
than Jesse James
and Tiger Woods combined.
And just as they cast
their spell upon the nation,
one by one--poof, poof--
they vanish.
But tonight, through the magic
of television,
you can thank your lucky stars,
because all our queens
are back--
tucked, plucked,
and ready to conjure up
a little realness.
First up, these two queens came
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
representing the South.
Can I get a big hallelu for
Miss Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
and from Atlanta, Georgia,
Miss Nicole Paige Brooks.
Next up, Miss Two-Piece
and a Biscuit herself,
Mystique Summers Madison.
The last time these two queens
were together,
they were lip-synching
for their lives.
Please welcome back Sonique
and Morgan McMichaels.
Hello, ladies.
all: Hi.
- [laughs]
All right, girls, let's dish.
- Uh-oh.
- Shangela, was that corn
on your wrist?
- Ooh! Yes!
This is my new Gaga-inspired
"cornsage."
- A-mazing.
- Yes, I've learned a little bit
in the last year.
- Now, you'd been doing drag
for just a few months
before coming to<i> Drag Race.</i>
Do you think you were too green
to be on<i> Drag Race?</i>
- No, I definitely came
to this competition to compete,
to be a drag superstar.
I mean, did you see the
lip-synch for your life? Okay?
I definitely came to party
with the people.
But you guys said that I needed
a little bit more time.
This wasn't RuPaul's school
for girls, all right?
All right!
So I left, learned a little
something,
and then went and won
this California Entertainer
of the Year pageant
and came home with a crown, ow.
- Okay.
[laughing]
So you're snatching trophies
and corn.
- Honey, I'm snatching
everything,
and hopefully a husband is next.
Hallelu.
- Thank you.
All right, Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
- Yes, sir.
- I know that you are
a fierce drag mama.
Uh, you're also
a fierce drag papa.
- Yes.
- Did your son get
to see the show?
- He saw the Barbie part,
when we did the Barbies,
and he's like,
"Oh, Da-da's on TV."
And he got really excited.
But, um, he hasn't seen Nicole
yet.
But there's pictures of me
all over the house,
and you ask him who that is,
and he's like, "I don't know."
I don't think that it's all come
together yet, but it will.
- How old is he?
- He's four.
- Now, you didn't last as long
as some people predicted.
- Yeah.
- Now, what were
your frustrations
with the competition?
- I really...liked all
the sorority of the girls.
You know, we were pretty unified
when we were here.
And then I was shocked to see
Raven talking about everybody
behind our backs.
To be honest, my feelings--
- Were you really?
- I was really surprised.
- Really?
See, I thought Raven was
very up-front, like me.
- You didn't say nothin'
behind my back.
- No, of course, not, but,
like, I didn't think Raven did
either.
- Well, we will discuss that
when Raven comes out.
- Yeah.
- All right, Mystique.
Now, you said you were bringing
up the plus-size gals.
Did you get a lot of support
from the community?
- Yes, I got a lot of people
saying, "Thank you for showing
me that I can go out there
and just be me and not conform
to, like, society's thoughts."
- Now, some people felt
that you had given up
on the last challenge,
that you had sort
of thrown in the towel.
- There's a lot of issues
with that.
I live in Dallas, Fort Worth.
And a lot of the gangs and stuff
was acting up in Mexico,
and they was kidnapping
Americans.
'Cause my mom works in Mexico.
So that morning, I heard that a
lot of Americans was kidnapped.
So in my head, I was like,
"I don't know
if it's my mom there."
- She's not a drug mule,
is she?
- No, she is not!
- She was okay, right?
- She was okay, be--
- Well, I have to ask, then,
about why the<i> schmatta</i><span style="bodyStyle"> blouse</i>
and the black pants.
- I mean, the black pants,
they were busted.
- But the thing is, I wanted
to be, like, you know,
the up-to-date,
country type of thing.
- Time out! Please.
Real quick.
I'm a native Texan.
And you said I'm representing
the people who really dress
like this in Texas.
This is representative
of how we dress.
That is not representative of
how everyone dresses in Texas.
And your makeup skills are not
how everyone in Texas
does makeup.
- True.
- Well, Mystique, you look
beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.
- You look gorgeous.
All right, Sonique.
- Hi.
- Now, I gotta say,
the elimination
between you and Morgan
was one of the toughest
I've ever done.
'Cause you were both incredible.
- Thank you.
- Did I get it right, though?
- I actually--I don't know.
I thought I was prepared
and everything like that,
and I've learned so much more
about myself
and about my drag
and everything.
But I--I felt like
the whole time I was here,
I was in a dream.
- Was it a sweet dream or
a beautiful nightmare for you?
- My mind was always
somewhere else.
- Like, where else?
What are you talking about?
- I don't really feel
that people got a chance
to get to know who Sonique is.
- And I've heard that there's
something you want to share
with us concerning that.
- I don't know,
I was always just so...
Um...it's very personal,
and I don't want to...
- Can I check on her?
- We'll give her a moment.
- [crying] I know
they don't understand.
And that's--
and that's the reason why
I've been so unhappy
for so long.
- Hey, kiddo, you okay?
What is it, honey?
Talk to me.
- I haven't been happy for
a really long time in my life.
And I've never understood why.
I just had to be honest
with myself and...
I've...
I'm a woman.
I'm not a boy who dresses up.
The--I feel like the only thing
I've ever done right
was go to a doctor
and start transitioning.
I've never been more happier
in my entire life.
- Good.
You want--would you...
join the group again?
- Yeah.
- Maybe we could talk
a little bit about it.
- I'm proud of you.
- Come on, baby.
- Thank you.
I'm so happy.
How's my makeup look?
- Destroyed, bitch.
- Don't do that to me.
- All right, ladies,
Sonique is back.
Do you feel safe to share
something with the group?
- I always knew that there
wasn't something right.
I couldn't ever be boy enough.
I've always been a girl.
I've always been a girl
trapped in a boy's body.
I started doing drag.
And...there was just something
about it that wasn't enough.
And I've--I went to a doctor,
and he put me on testosterone
blockers,
and then moved me to hormones,
and my levels are even,
and I've never been happier
in my whole life.
- Well, I know a lot of people
get it confused--
what a transsexual is and what--
- There's a line between drag
and transgender.
Most transgender girls
do not do drag.
You know, they want to live
their life solely as a woman,
where drag queens want to get
out of drag and be a man.
When I go home, I ne--
I dread taking off my makeup.
- Listen, I'm so happy and proud
of you for being so courageous.
'Cause I know how hard that is.
You know, I--I'm a man,
I do drag,
and that's what I do for work.
But for you to make
this realization,
to be happy performing
but also to clarify
not only for all of us,
but for yourself,
I applaud you.
And I think it's so courageous.
And you have our support, this
family here, forever, any time.
[light applause]
All right.
Moving on
to Miss Morgan McMichaels.
Now, I hear that you are
transitioning from being a man
into a butch man.
Is that right?
- [deep voice] Absolutely.
[all laugh]
We're going in different
directions, Sonique and I.
- Now, Morgan, you and Mystique
had your moments together.
- Did we?
- When?
- When?
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, here we go.
You have no class
and no manners.
- No class, no manners?
You piss me off some more,
I will whoop your fucking ass!
Bitch, I am from Chicago!
[laughs]
- Wow.
Morgan, that was intense.
- You know, at the end
of the day, I'm a man.
And I'm not gonna let people
disrespect me.
Now, everything that I said
during the fight,
obviously it was elevated,
and it was heated.
And, you know,
your makeup is your own,
and your hair is your own,
and everything that you do
to make Mystique is fabulous.
I think you're
an amazing entertainer.
- Why, thank you.
I love you too.
We should make out later.
- Ew.
- [laughs]
See, no, we had a heart-to-heart
since the whole fight.
- Yeah, we've spoken.
- We spoke.
Some people think we don't talk,
and we're just pissed off
at each other.
- People are under the illusion
that one fight has ended
any chance of a friendship.
- Are there any girls that you
haven't kept in touch with?
- I haven't spoken
with Tatianna.
Like, watching the episodes and,
like, watching the comments
she made about me,
I was not surprised.
I think I was more disappointed.
- So you found out more about
what she said
once you watched the show.
- Once I watched the episodes,
and she kept calling me a whore,
and I needed to be knocked off
my high horse,
I think it was
from her own insecurity,
'cause I never said a bad word
about Tatianna.
- Well, you'll have a chance
to speak with Tatianna
face-to-face,
and all the other girls,
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Our next doll
is a dancin' queen.
Welcome back, Sahara Davenport.
From sizzling San Juan,
it's Miss Jessica Wild.
<i>Escandalo!</i>
When this queen's in the house,
it's a barrel of laughs.
Give it up for Pandora Boxx!
This next queen's natural beauty
is undeniable.
Welcome back the ravishing
Tatianna.
The song you just sashayed out
to is the Bangkok Booty Mix
of<i> LadyBoy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
available on iTunes.
Sahara, now, during the show,
we found out that your mother
was a minister
and that your family wasn't that
supportive of your drag career.
Since the show, what's happened?
- One night,
I was heading out to a gig,
and I got a text from her:
"I see you on RuPaul's show,
and you look fabulous.
Call me."
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna call her,
and this woman is gonna cuss me
the [...] out."
- You thought
it was an intervention?
- Yeah, I thought
it was an intervention,
but I actually called her
the next morning.
She was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you."
- Would you say
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is bringing families together?
- Christian, black families
together!
- All right, praise--
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu!
[laughter]
- What reaction
do you get from fans
who've watched you on the show?
- I get Facebooks all the time
from little boys who are asking
me questions like,
"I want to tell my mom.
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.
Please help me."
And it's just like,
"I didn't know I was signing up
for that," you know.
I thought I was coming on,
you know, to--
to be fabulous and show
the world my talent and,
you know,
increase my booking fee.
[laughter]
But the show definitely
has given me a voice,
and it's taught me that,
outside of just the performance,
that we all have a voice
and have a responsibility
to not only our community,
but to the world,
to share and help those in need
as much as we can.
- That's lovely,
and you're absolutely right.
Thank you, Sahara.
Now, Jessica, you had some
issues with your English.
- Yes.
I was so scared when you called
me that I'm on the show.
Because I don't speak English.
But I think, at the same time,
"I'm not gonna quit.
I'm just gonna do it."
- Well, I think your accent
is absolutely charming.
- Sometimes I'm lost,
but I'm acting like...
"Oh, oh, yes.
"Oh, my God, the judges?
"Oh, I love it.
I love it."
- What's the wildest thing
people have written to you?
- A mom write me that her son
want to be a drag queen.
And her son have ten years old.
And she said, "Now you show me
that my son is a special,
and I need to love him more
and more."
So I teach people that my mom
love me, no matter what.
So you need to support your
family, because we are specials.
- Yeah.
Thank you, Jessica.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, now,<i> Entertainment</i>
<i>Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> called your elimination</i>
the most controversial.
And at one point in the show,
I called you the Susan Lucci
of<i> Drag Race.</i>
You came very close
to winning challenges,
but you never won a challenge.
Do you hate me?
- I was the one
that keyed your car.
- Oh, it was you!
- Yeah.
I feel much better now.
- Oh, good.
So, Pandora, you made
a very brave admission
at one point in the show.
Let's take a look.
- I tried to kill myself.
- Oh, no, sir.
- I didn't understand.
I didn't know what gay was.
I knew I was totally different,
I felt totally alone.
I thought that, you know,
"Well, I'll just take
all these pills
because I don't--
I can't deal with it anymore."
- Now, that was very brave,
and I was very moved by that.
What's the reaction been?
- I've gotten many emails
from people
saying that they have gone
through the same thing,
and they've felt
the same emotion.
And I actually got, probably,
the most powerful email.
Somebody said,
by hearing my story,
that they said
that I saved their life.
I burst into tears.
I was blown away by that.
- It's amazing the power
that you have as queen,
and it's quite a gift.
I also remember that you talked
about your father,
and that he, you know, wasn't
that accepting of what you do,
and that he had been ill.
- He always accepted me being
gay, but the drag thing,
he just didn't want
to really acknowledge.
- Was there any closure there?
- There was a moment
before he passed away.
It was actually a week
before he passed away.
And he called me and he said
that he watched<i> Drag Race,</i>
and that he was so proud of me,
and he was my number one fan.
And that's the call...
[choking back tears]
That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.
- That's beautiful.
And so many have been waiting
for that call.
Do you have anything to say
about the people out there
who have been waiting
for that call?
- I would just say that know
that you're good enough,
and you're perfect
the way that you are.
And you have to affirm
your life,
and that's what I did before,
but it was amazing to at least
have that moment
before he passed away.
- Well, no matter what happens,
I mean,
you always kept us laughing,
and that's worth $1 billion.
- Can I get paid a $1 billion
for it?
[laughter]
- I love that outfit,
by the way.
It's your<i> Drag Race</i>
official dress.
- It is.
You know, I'll just go
into merchandising for it.
- I think it's brilliant.
Yeah.
- By Marco Marco.
Well, I came up
with the concept,
and then he did it for me.
- It's brilliant.
- Changed a few things.
- Yeah, it's great.
- It's got it all: the checkered
flag, the runway--
Brilliant.
I figure if
I couldn't win the race,
I'll at least win the race in
this outfit.
- Yes, absolutely.
And I'm sure Santino will have
a lot to say about that outfit.
- [laughs]
And I'm sure I won't listen
to him again.
[laughter]
- I thank you, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna.
- Hey.
- T-A-T-I.
Yeah, you were one controversial
character on the show.
- Evidently.
- During the show,
you were pretty beat up
by the other girls.
- There was a few nights
that I went back to the hotel
and just cried and didn't really
want to talk about it.
'cause I didn't want people
to see
that they were getting to me.
- Did it affect you?
- It definitely affected me.
When I left here, I didn't want
to be around drag queens
for a good minute.
[laughter]
I'll say that right now.
I did not want to.
- Now, in a mini-challenge,
we asked you to throw shade
in front of everyone.
And you kind of froze up.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yet...
[laughs]
You weren't shy about
criticizing others
during your interviews.
- Oh, no.
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, boy. Shall we?
[laughs]
I am so happy
that someone said something
about Morgan's whoreness.
Sonique, she always got
that stank face.
Raven all of a sudden decides
that she to blossom, verbally.
These sparkling 30 years that
she's got behind her,
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.
She's just got to spread it.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Do you think it's okay to say
something behind somebody's back
as opposed to--to their face?
- I didn't come in with,
like, a strategy of,
"Well, I'm gonna be nice,
and then I'm gonna cut 'em,
you know, behind the scenes."
Like, it wasn't like that.
I wanted to speak of others how
I would want to be spoken about.
When someone comes at me wrong,
then that rule's going out
the window,
and I'm talking some shit.
- When did I ever say or do
anything to you
to make you say something
about me?
Because I never was
that way to you.
- No one said every single thing
that they thought
to that person.
- Well, neither did you.
- No one did.
I know, I know,
and I'm not saying I did either.
- I definitely did.
You're a little more reserved.
I mean, sure, your legs--
you have great stems, honey.
But you know what I'm saying?
But I just didn't appreciate
the fact that, you know,
you totally slung me, like,
"Oh, she's a whore."
- I didn't mean literally
you are a whore.
- Right.
- Certainly not.
- So, Tatianna, the biggest
critique from the other girls
was that they felt you were
getting by on your looks.
Now, how did that make you feel?
- It kind of pissed me off.
- Kind of pissed you off
or really pissed you off?
- It really pissed me off.
- Tell me about it.
- It truly pissed me off.
I'm more than a face.
I have something to say.
I have thoughts.
- You're a great pair of legs
too.
- Thank you.
I think that you saw
that I was progressing,
and that I was growing,
and I feel like all the other
girls chopped it down to,
"Oh, well, she's just pretty.
She's just Rebecca."
And I'm like,
"No, I'm more than that."
Just because I have a more of
a realistic type look sometimes
doesn't mean that I'm any less
of a queen than anyone else.
As long as I have a dick between
my legs and a wig on my head,
I'm a drag queen.
- Dressed.
- Point-blank, period.
And that is the way that it is.
- The criteria gets down
to the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
And you really can't even
compare all of you, you know?
You're all winners.
You're all winners.
Coming up, we'll be joined by
Raven, Jujubee,
and America's Next Drag
Superstar, Tyra Sanchez.
The new Tyra.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Let's welcome back the Laotian
in the house,
the incomparable Miss Jujubee!
Early in the competition,
this next queen almost sashayed
away, twice.
But she dug deep,
stepped up her game,
and ended up in the top two.
That is so Raven.
This last doll always
stole the show.
And some of these queens
want it back.
America's next drag superstar,
Miss Tyra Sanchez!
[applause]
Tyra!
- Hey.
- My queen.
Mwah. Mwah.
Gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, darling.
You're all here.
How 'bout that?
Look around you.
These are your sisters.
Win or lose, love or hate,
we are family.
[shaky voice]
And I am your mother.
- Oh.
- Mommy.
- Jujubee.
- Hi.
- You talked a little in the
show about being a gay Asian.
Have all the Gasians out there
contacted you?
- Yes.
- What have they said?
- They--they say
that it's an inspiring feat
for me to be on television
and talk about my culture
and actually speak Laotian.
And, you know,
my family's really happy.
I'm very excited.
- Have you talked to your mom?
- I have not.
- Now, if your mom
is watching this,
is there anything
you'd like to say to her?
- Thank you for giving me life.
You know, I mean, that's...
That's really
what I have right now.
It's--it's been ten years, but
I need a little bit--I need--
I need a little bit more time.
- Another ten years?
- No, I wouldn't--I don't know.
I-I feel bad, and I feel
for her, but I'm not ready.
Maybe Jujubee's gonna help bring
that out,
but it's just
a struggle for me still.
- So you didn't become
America's Next Drag Superstar.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is next for you?
- I'm still gonna
keep doing drag.
I mean, I wanna be in movies.
I wanna be onstage.
I wanna--I wanna play Angel
on Broadway in<i> Rent.</i>
I wanna do it all.
- I think that's gonna happen
for you.
The opportunity has opened up
for each of you.
The fact that you made it
into this competition...
eh, uh...
just under 300 years old.
I know some things, and the fact
that this happened--
don't take it for granted,
ladies.
The world is yours, but it
depends on what you put into it.
- I agree.
- Now, Raven, you were
in the bottom two twice.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you ended up number two.
How'd you pull that off?
- I knew when I fucked up.
Like, I knew when I did a bad
job, and I owned up to it.
My chicken was the most horrible
chicken in the fucking world.
Welcome to another...
Oh, shit.
- So your chicken was funky.
- Really funky, girl.
I was so focused on having,
like, a Southern accent...
So then I see that Jessica
was doing a chicken voice,
I'm like,
"I'm such a fucking airhead."
Why wouldn't I do
a chicken voice?
- Now, Raven, you were not shy
during the competition,
and you were liberal
in speaking your mind.
Let's take a look.
- Nicole's gone.
Praise the Lord.
She has acrylic toenails...
with white French tips.
Tatianna's an airhead.
All she's been doing the past
couple weeks is...this.
Tatianna is about face value.
So fuck you, Tatianna.
- Fuck you, too, bitch.
- Mwah.
- Let me put it out there
real quick.
- Tatianna, how do you feel
about hearing all that?
- Um...
I think my feelings
are easily explained.
You're jealous.
You're insecure.
No one that feels that great
about themselves
has to put others down
the way that you do.
I have had very negative
feelings towards you
since the end of that show.
Now, I know that
I said some shit.
But really, though, how do you
say something like what you said
to people--like Nicole.
I think Nicole genuinely
thought she made a friend.
- We were not talking about
Nicole and I right now.
We were talking
about you and me.
- Okay, well,
then let me get back to it.
- But, I mean, that is a fact.
I really did think
I found a friend.
I was gagged by that.
- Until the point--
- Okay--
- I'm not done talking yet.
You will speak when I'm done.
- Ooh.
- Honey.
- Security.
- She has gotten everything that
she wanted to say out about me.
It's my turn.
And I never said anything
hurtful about you.
I said that you run your mouth,
'cause you do.
But I didn't, like--I didn't
go for, "Oh, she's fat.
"Oh, she's an airhead.
"She's dumb, she's nothing.
They're living for someone
that's nothing."
Bullshit.
- When my opinion was asked for,
is when I gave it.
- When you were in an interview?
- When I went into the
interview, they would say,
"What do you think about this?
What do you think about that?"
Here's my opinion.
So if it came off and sounded
shitty,
sorry that it sounded shitty.
- No, you're not.
Don't give empty apologies.
You're not sorry for shit.
- Okay, well, then I'm done.
- 'Cause I haven't heard
from you.
The only thing I've heard from
you was, "You're gorgeous."
And then another message,
"You're gorgeous."
- 'Cause you are gorgeous,
and I've told you that
since day one.
You, out of everyone in this
competition,
has the most beautiful face
in this competition.
- I'm more than a face.
- It's just malicious,
just gay faggotry
that I just was not thinking
we were gonna run into here.
- Well, guess what.
We are making a TV show.
So don't sit here and act like
we were filming an episode
of<i> 7th Heaven.</i>
- I didn't say that.
- It's a fucking drag
competition.
- Yeah, I know, but, I mean,
but they were all smiling
in my face at one point.
- I never smiled in your face,
and I never hung out with you.
So you can sit there and say
that we were cool
and we hung out--we never did.
Every one of you, even Morgan,
can sit here and say,
"You're a fucking bitch."
I don't care.
- That's evident.
It's very evident.
That's the problem.
That is your problem.
Your personality is for shit.
- It's not a problem actually.
- You are the one
that is face value.
Your outside is gorgeous, Raven,
but your insides are dark and
nasty, and I don't like you.
- You were pretty bitchy
yourself, so there.
- I wasn't that bad.
I was not like you.
I wasn't like you.
Let's be clear.
The people I spoke shit about,
I'm sorry, at the point in time,
they deserved it,
and I was mad.
But I didn't deserve
what you said about me.
I didn't deserve it
and neither did anyone else.
- So you going, "Oh, I pity you
for the face you have,"
that's not the same thing?
- There's a difference.
I'm sorry, but there's a
blatant, obvious difference.
- I know Raven really well,
and Raven's a beautiful fucking
person.
I know you really well,
and I know you're a fucking
beautiful person.
You guys have such
the same traits
that it doesn't work.
Do you know what I'm saying?
And I hate--and I hate--
and I hate to say that to you
and to you, because I know you
don't like that,
but there's a lot
of similarities.
So live with it or just don't
talk to each other.
- And I will say,
on my last night--
or my last day there,
I had a conversation with you,
and I said, "You know what,
"we do have things in common.
I don't understand why you hate
me so much."
And it's almost like you look at
me, and you see--
- Well, I don't hate you.
I don't hate you, Tatianna.
- The things that you say,
I can't fathom--
not hating someone,
but then feeling justified
and not wanting to apologize
for the things that you said.
- If it hurt your feelings,
okay, then I am sorry
that it hurt your feelings.
I am not sorry for saying it.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Now, we are overly sensitive.
But your feelings are not facts.
And I said this to the first
season,
because they got their panties
in a bunch
over things that are said.
Listen, kiddo,
things are gonna be said.
And you're all highly
intelligent,
you're all highly sensitive.
You have to not let it
hurt your feelings.
Raven is a little more seasoned.
So her skin is a little bit
thicker, basically.
- It's weathered.
- It's--[laughs]
Raven, you're under a lot
of heat right now,
but you've also made millions
and millions of fans.
Would you have done anything
differently?
- I wouldn't have said a lot of
things that I did or said them
the way that I did.
I realize I don't speak
eloquently.
I'm not a lady.
- Oh, no, I think you speak
very eloquently.
- Well, thank you.
But I--you know, and I have
the mouth of a trucker.
So I'm like--I guess you could
say I'm an eloquent trucker.
[laughter]
I would have worded things
a lot softer.
Because like Pandora said in one
of the<i> Untuckeds,</i>
that the next drag superstar
needs to be
basically not such
a wretched cunt.
- [laughs]
- So I would have worded things
differently.
- Really?
- Yep.
- Now, Tatianna,
Raven apologized,
but you still seem
to be holding onto it.
Why is that?
- 'Cause, you know,
I am sensitive.
And the things that she said
did bother me.
And when I came here I, "A," had
no friends in the drag world.
I had also never traveled
by myself before.
I'd never been on a plane
by myself before.
I had never been
away from my family
as long as I was by myself.
So I think it just--
you think of someone
in your head a certain way,
and when you watch it,
it's completely different,
it kind of--it hurts.
- Yeah.
- And I should not have been as
vocal as I was about Tatianna,
about you, again,
and I'm gonna speak to you.
I apologize.
- So, kids, this is the perfect
time for a little hug.
- For your mother.
- For your mother.
- Aw.
Well, Tatianna, Raven,
I hope you feel better.
I know I do.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Tyra Sanchez.
- Hi.
- America's Next Drag Superstar.
Now, some people probably think
this is a controversial decision
to have you as
the Next Drag Superstar.
Of all the girls, you received
some of the harshest criticisms
from the other competitors.
Expressions like
"lazy bitch,"
"immature,"
"mannerless."
- "Satan's baby."
- "Satan's baby."
How's that make you feel?
- When I watched it, I realized
that, at the time,
I was all those things that they
were calling me.
All I can do is, like, apologize
to Sahara and to Tatianna,
all the girls, Jujubee, whoever.
If I hurt your feelings,
if I did anything to,
like, make you upset,
like Pandora, or anyone else,
I can only apologize.
I can't take back what I did.
But I can only make
from this day forward better.
- Well, you know, a lot of
people who have written in
have very strong feelings
about you.
You know,
they acknowledge the fact
that you are a fierce queen,
but your behavior on the show
turned them off.
Is there anything you want
to say to them?
- And all I could ask is that
for them to reach out
and pray for me,
pray for me and pray for my son,
like, for us
to have a better life
and to be better people
within ourselves.
- Um, coming back here,
you know,
you get to reconnect with people
you haven't seen in a while,
and I saw a complete change
in Tyra.
She's completely not the--
not the same Tyra
that I fought with.
She's not that Tyra anymore.
- What's changed?
- Just the general demeanor.
It just seems like she's
a lot more like, "Hello."
It looks like she wants
to try and integrate.
I didn't get that on the show.
It would be everyone hanging out
and then Tyra separating herself
to a certain extent.
- I think she was just
so focused on a goal,
and that she didn't want to come
and hang out with everyone
because then she would end up
not being focused
on the next day's challenge
and could possibly end up
in the bottom two.
- Is that true, Tyra?
- Before I came here,
I didn't have a place to stay.
I was sleeping
on my drag mother's floor.
I didn't have a job.
When I came here,
my goal was to win.
If I went home empty-handed,
like, that wasn't an option.
But my mom, like,
she always teached me,
when you want something,
you pray for it.
And so I stayed prayed up.
That's what I call it,
I prayed up.
When I went into the hotel,
I didn't want to hang out.
I stayed in my room and, like,
I would ask God for ideas,
creations for the next
challenge, or what to do on,
like, on the runway.
Give me the idea that I need
to win this challenge.
- She's young.
She have the opportunity
to change, and I think she did.
And I just want to say
that I'm so proud of you.
And I feel great that you are
the Next Drag Superstar,
because you have
a lot of talent.
A lot of people love you,
and we are going to support you
in your career.
- I'm a fan, I really am.
Like, watching the show,
you can't take it from her.
Watching the show I'm like,
"The bitch turned it."
- Well, listen, I think that
your prayers were answered,
and I think that people
will pray for you
and your success as America's
Next Drag Superstar.
I have to say, you came here
with a drag mother
who clearly taught you
the rules of drag.
In the wedding challenge,
you come out on your knees
behind the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen.
You peekaboo around it,
throw the flowers in the air,
and jump up
without support on your feet.
And when I called you out
after your runway presentation,
you had tears in your eyes.
And you pulled the veil
over your face back
in the back of the room.
Bitch, your pussy was on fire.
That shit was fierce.
Now, I'm--I told you,
I'm just under 300 years old.
Seen a lot of queens.
That kind of behavior
that you had clearly learned
from another elderly queen
such as I,
that's magic.
That's magic shit
right there.
- Thank you.
- Now, Tyra, how do you think
winning the crown will
change your life?
- This is opening so many doors
for me, and not only me,
for my son, just to make
his life better
and to give him the things
that I didn't have.
I actually got custody of him,
so now, this month, he's gonna
be staying with me
from this point on.
And I just, like, have everyone
helping me out in so many ways.
- Tyra, I just have to ask you.
Aside from your beautiful,
bejeweled bosom,
is there a secret
to your smile?
- Yes, I got a new smile,
not because of the reading
that we had.
- Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue canceled?
Your grill is fucked up.
- Oop!
- The barbecue is back, honey.
- The barbecue is back on.
And not because of what people
were saying on the Internet.
I did it for myself.
Got it fixed,
got it straightened.
I even got my voice deepened.
[laughter]
- Can they do that?
- They can do that.
It goes deeper and deeper
every day.
[laughter]
- All right, coming up,
the girls get their chance
to judge the judges
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
keeps on keeping on.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Now, drag queens are always
getting judged.
Every once in a while,
it's nice to give a little back.
So, girls, sharpen your claws
for two of my favorite people
in the world.
Please welcome back our resident
biological woman,
Merle Ginsberg,
and the always fashionable
Santino Rice.
Now, the two of you
are L.A. party people.
Who out there surprised you
that were fans of the show?
- I did a little job
interviewing people
on a red carpet,
and I had to interview Johnny
Weir, the great skater,
and I'm so excited to meet
Johnny Weir.
And I put out my hand, he goes,
"Oh, I love you.
I love<i> Drag Race."</i>
I was like, "I can't even
believe this is happening."
- Now, Merle,
this season on our show,
what stood out fashion-wise?
- Well, Tyra's looks
just blew me away.
They really did.
They were so Paris runway,
Christian Dior.
And I just kept wondering,
how the hell did she do that?
- When you are
in a situation like this
and the whole world is watching,
yeah, you hot glue things
to your body,
you super glue earrings
to your ears.
You see where people's
dedication and passion is
and how bad you want this.
- You chop off those toes
to fit in those shoes.
- Yeah.
- Now, Santino, you saved
your harshest criticism
for Pandora Boxx.
Tell me this, Pandora,
how did it feel
when you were being critiqued
on the runway?
- It was horrible.
It's hard to be up there getting
critiqued, and it did affect me.
And by the wedding challenge,
that's really where I kind
of--I had a breakdown.
I had a breakdown in my room,
because I just went in there and
just cried because I was like,
"I don't know what to do.
"I feel like I'm listening.
"I feel like I'm trying
to do what--
the best I can and to take
everybody's critiques
and do it."
But when you're told that,
"I don't like your style,"
I kind of didn't know
where to go from there.
- All I could say is, Pandora,
do you feel like,
out of all these queens,
you have the best personal style
and you were the most
fashionable every challenge?
- Um, I definitely don't feel
that I was,
but that's not
my strongest suit.
- Sure.
- But, you know,
I can hire a stylist.
And some of these girls
in the competition
needed a personality lift,
and you can't get one of those.
- You're right.
You're absolutely right.
And seeing you today, Pandora,
I think you look amazing.
I think what you're wearing
is funny, it's young.
You look stylish, hip,
but there were times
where you came out,
and it seemed like it was kind
of a rehabbed pageant gown
or something that wasn't quite
up to your personality
and your comedic timing.
- It's about knowing thyself
and presenting that
on the stage,
and you can never go wrong.
- The biggest thing I learned
is not to second-guess myself.
Because every outfit that got
a really harsh critique,
there was another one that I was
gonna wear instead and I said,
"Wear that other one."
and I changed my mind
at the last minute
and just kept what I had on.
So I wish I would have listened
to my inner voice that said
that, you know, "You need to--
You need to wear
the better outfit."
- What do you have to say about
Santino's outfit tonight?
- [laughs]
- I love homeless chic.
I think it looks great.
[laughter]
- You know what, let's all
together, all the contestants,
let out a primal yell directed
towards the judges' panel
over here.
Just yell it out.
One, two, three.
[all yelling]
- [laughs]
Merle, Santino, thank you
so much for coming back.
Now when we return,
the viewers have voted,
and I will announce your choice
for the fabulous
Las Vegas Miss Congeniality
and the final lip-synch
for your life.

- Aw!
- This bitch, she was trying
to annoy everyone around her.
- Ugh!
- Just get yourself some manners
so you won't look
so damn stupid.
- [chuckles]
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.
- Oh!

Tyra Sanchez, congratulations.
You're the winner

[laughter]
I love you, Morgan.
It sucks that Morgan's gone,
but I feel now that my chances
of being in the bottom two
are a lot less.
While she was here,
I was being too focused
on not only me but her too.
I'm gonna do
what I got to do now.
- I'm still a little shaken
after yesterday's elimination
and being in the bottom two.
I'm nervous.
I don't want to be

You want happy ending, honey?
- Not particularly.
[laughter]
- After everything that happened
last night, I feel great.
I don't hold grudges
against anyone,
but I can tell that Tatianna is
sort of holding a grudge.
- Ow!
I don't have any regrets
calling Tyra out.
I hope she took
from the situation
something to work on
in the future,
but that's her deal, not mine.
- Y'all, I was tucked
so fiercely the other day,
I had a blister on you-know-what
and I thought I had an STD.
[laughter]
- Ooh, girl!
You got she-mail.
You want to be
the next drag superstar?
Well, first you better take
a little piece of my heart.
Then you better hit me
with your best shot.
And finally you need
to sing a song
just like a white-winged dove.
So what are you waiting for?
It's time to put another dime
in the jukebox, baby.
Yeah.
- Rock and roll.
They're all titles
of rock and roll songs.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Maybe we have to make
a rock and roll costume?
- That's okay.
- Or maybe we have to be
a rock band with all of us.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
- Oh, what do we have there?
- Oh, wow.
- A great drag queen
is like a rock star.
She pushes it to the limit.
But the one thing that remains
her crowning glory is her hair.
For today's mini challenge,
you'll be styling these wigs,
provided by Wig Pro Collections,
into the biggest, baddest
rocker chick hair
this side of Tina Turner.
You'll have 30 minutes
to turn your wig
into a glam rock piece of art.
And the one who really pumps up
the volume will win.
Your challenge...
starts now!
- Ah!
- Y'all some shady bitches.
So shit.
- It's like vultures
fighting over a dead animal
in the middle of the desert.
- Jeez.
- 30 minutes
is not a lot of time
to put in
a really good hairstyle,
so I'm a little worried.
- Where's my teasing comb?
Where's my teasing comb?
I want to win this challenge.
I haven't won anything.
Everybody else has.
- I have no idea what I'm doing
with this hair.
I don't know how to style hair.
I'm not a hair stylist.
So I'm like,
"Shit, what do I do?"
- I'm thinking in my head,
"Think outside the box.
Pandora, think outside the box."
- I look over and I see Pandora
doing hers, and I'm like,
"It looks like Cindy Lou Who
from a Dr. Seuss book."
I'm like,
"What the hell is she doing?"
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
That's right.
Rocker chicks,
turn your blow dryers off
and put those rat combs down.
All right,
let's start with Tyra.
Sit it right here.
- Anytime I see a video,
I always see 'em with, like,
a mohawk
and it's just, like, real poofy
and, like, puffed out.
I am happy
with how my hair looked.
It kind of reminded me
of Sasha Fierce.
All the other wigs
were a little trashy.
- My inspiration
was a little Joan Jett
but a little Pat Benatar.
- This is actually a nice cut,
but she's kind of
a conservative rocker chick.
It's more sort of a rocker mom.
Wow.
- She just finished a show with
her band, Thundercunt.
And afterwards,
there was a hotel party
and she got completely trashed.
- You might want to get her
into rehab.
- I don't know much
about rock and roll,
but I do enjoy the music
of Pat Benatar.
So I know her hair is short
and kind of powerful,
so I went--chose to go with,
like, a asymmetrical bob
and a little crimping.
- I'm wondering why
you didn't crimp more.
- Well, she's subtle.
- She's a subtle rocker chick.
- Yeah.
- This is Mustang Sally.
- Oh, is this her?
- This is her.
- I've heard of her.
- Yes.
- Pandora's hairstyle
was a mess.
It was like three Halloween
jack-o'-lanterns
stacked on top of each other.
- She has a guitar on her head.
The strings are right here.
- Oh, she sure does.
- Yes, and if you're lucky,
maybe she'll let you play
her head.
- It's like RuPaul does
Cyndi Lauper, doesn't it?
- My inspiration
is the cartoon from the '80s
<i>Jem and the Holograms.</i>
- Oh, yes,
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> yeah.</i>
- The rock band.
You can use tomorrow this.
- I will definitely consider
using that tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- It's always good
to have a backup.
All right, Jujubee.
She's got so much going on here.
- This is kind of like
the end of the week for her,
and she's getting ready
to go shopping for deli meats,
and she decided
to just put everything on.
- So girl to girl...
- Yeah?
- When did you lose control
of this wig?
- When I got the wig.
- [laughs]
Ladies, you all rocked
this challenge,
but there can only be
one winner, and that queen is...
Pandora Boxx.
Congratulations, Pandora.
You'll find out what you've won
in a moment.
For your main challenge,
you're going
to transform yourselves
into hot rocker chicks.
You can use your own drag,
plus materials provided
by Leg Avenue
and Michael Levine Fabrics.
I expect you to take
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
and amp it up to 11.
But wait.
♪<i> There's more ♪</i>
For this week's challenge, I'm
going to ask you to do something
that I've never asked any of
my girls to do before.
For the first time ever
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
each of you will be singing live
to a heavy metal version
of my song<i> Ladyboy.</i>
- My heart kind of just dropped.
I just don't want to do it.
- To help you prepare
for your singing debut,
you'll be working with one of
my favorite rocker chicks,
whose monster hits include
<i>No More Words</i>
and<i> Take My Breath Away.</i>
Their latest CD is called
<i>All The Way In.</i>
I'm talking about the amazing
Terri Nunn from Berlin.
- I can't believe Terri Nunn's
gonna be coaching.
I can't believe
we're gonna meet Terri Nunn.
Terri fucking Nunn is here.
- Now, Pandora, since you won
the mini challenge,
you get an extra ten minutes
with Terri.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Rock on!

then what challenge
I'm going to win?
- Girl, I'm in the same boat
as you.

is to make our own
rock and roll outfits.
And we will be performing
RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> live.</i>
- I am so excited.
- I'm nervous.
I'm so glad I have immunity.
- Do you know how to sing?
- The other day,
that was my real singing.
♪<i> Oh, ooh ♪</i>
I hope the judges don't tell me
to shut the fuck up.
- Does anybody have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
I need to rewrite the lyrics
so that it fits the tempo
that they sing it in,
'cause I can't visualize it
in my head.
This is the challenge
that I'm excited about.
I'm, like, 100% sure
that I'm gonna do fabulously.
I'm very confident about this.
I'm not gonna fuck up.
- Hey, my little runaways.
- Hey, Ru.
- Just checking in.
Looks like the rock shop.
Tyra, tell me about your outfit.
- Because I don't know
too much about rock,
I'm gonna try and go for
a more futuristic rock.
- Have you seen
Tina Turner's videos
or seen her on television?
- The only time
I saw Tina perform
is when she performed
with Beyonce.
- Why did I know
that was the answer?
All right, Tyra,
keep on working.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna ease on over here
to Miss Raven, who--
something tells me
there is a rocker chick
who lives constantly in you.
- Yes.
- Now, earlier in the run,
you said you don't sing at all.
- No.
- So how are--you feel confident
about doing this challenge?
- Yeah, I do, actually.
Like, I think that when it comes
to rock and roll,
it's about your stage presence.
That's such a good way to say,
"Fuck it."
- That's what rock and roll
is about.
Who do you think is your biggest
competition in this challenge?
- Jujubee.
- Why?
- Jujubee can sing.
She can sing,
and she can sing well.
- Maybe this challenge
is your opportunity
to really step it up.
- Well, I plan on it.
- Rock on.
I'll see you later.
All right.
- Bye.
- Jessica Wild.
- Hi, Ru.
- Look at you.
Are you ready for rock and roll?
- Yeah.
- Do you sing?
- I am not the best singer
of the world.
But I have the personality,
I have the energies,
and I have attitude.
- Yeah. Is this your
rocker chick hair right here?
- Yes, I am going to work
on that wig.
- Because Jessica Wild has
a signature movement,
and it's a hair flip?
- Yes.
- [laughs]
Okay.
Keep working.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Sahara.
Do you sing at all?
- I do sing,
but I've never done rock before.
- Now, you wound up
in the bottom two twice.
- Girl, don't remind me.
[laughs]
- What are you gonna do
this week to make sure
you don't find yourself
in the bottom two?
- I guess just overcoming myself
and being confident
and letting it out
and not hesitating
or holding back.
My confidence has been an issue
for a lot of my adult life,
and I guess it may be I'm afraid
of disappointing people.
- You ready to rock out?
- I'm ready.
Is that right?
[laughs]
- Tatianna, do you sing at all?
- I used to be in chorus,
but I would even lip-sync that,
'cause there would be
a group of us.
- Really?
- So I just mouthed the words.
- You were lip-synching for your
life in high school chorus?
- Yep, or I'd sing really soft.
- Why?
- Because I was really
made fun of a lot in school,
and so I really thought twice
about everything I did.
I started getting teased
for being gay
when I was in first grade.
I can't count
the amount of times
I was suspended for fighting.
- This is what I do.
And that voice that you're
talking about that says,
"You can't do that,"
that voice will always be there.
Look at me in the eye.
That voice will always be there.
What you have to do--
like muscles,
you have to counteract
that voice with another voice
that says,
"Thank you for sharing.
That was nice, but I'm gonna
do this over here."
This is your opportunity
to put this to the test.
So I want to see you go for it.
- Absolutely.
- All right, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Keep working.
- All right.
I think RuPaul
is really looking at me
and wanting to see that I don't
just fall back on my looks.
It definitely makes me want
to make him proud.
- Pandora.
Wow.
Lookit here.
Ooh, that's gonna move
really good.
Have I seen you do this before?
- I don't think
I have done that.
- Do it with me now.
Ow!
- Put it on me, Mister.
- ♪<i> Put it on me, mister ♪</i>
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
[laughter]
- I slipped into Cher.
I don't know how.
- Now, throughout
the competition,
we've actually asked Pandora
to push it more.
- I definitely agree, 'cause
I'm not really a singer either,
so I'm really gonna have to go
out of my box,
which was what I was told
in the last challenge,
to think outside the box.
This is very beyond it, so...
- Yeah.
All right, good luck, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Jujubee.
- Hi, mama.
- Hi, baby.
- What's going on?
- When I've spoken
with the other girls,
their main concern is you.
- Why?
- Because they say you can sing.
Now, tell me about that.
- I can hold a note.
- What's surprising to me
is that you have not won
a challenge yet.
- I haven't,
and I want to win this one.
- How are you gonna do that?
How you gonna win
this challenge?
- I know that Ru's there
to challenge me,
and it reminded me
of how my father pushed me.
- This is definitely a chance
for you to come out of the
shadow of the other girls.
- My father died when I was 15,
and because he believed in me,
I believe in myself.
I know that's the reason
I perform.
I'm gonna do it.
And I'm gonna make you happy.
I promise, girl.
[squeaks]
- Thank you, Jujubee.
- Thank you, mama.
This is the time
for me to shine,
and I'm gonna knock
everybody's socks off.
- Okay, ladies, in a moment,
you'll get your chance
to work with Terri Nunn.
And tomorrow,
in addition to Terri Nunn,
we'll be joined
on the main stage
by our extra special
guest judge,
the always sexy and outspoken
rocker Henry Rollins.
[cheers and applause]
Yes.
- He's so, um...
manly.
- He's got these huge hands.
I used to have the biggest crush
on him.
- All right, ladies, good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
All right.
- Bye, Ru!
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Terri Nunn is our coach.
She's the lead singer of Berlin.
- I'm Terri.
What's your name?
- I'm Juju.
- Hi, Juju.
- Very nice to meet you.
You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
So are you.
- It's insane,
and I'm like, "Wow."
- Cool.
Well, let's see the song.

I just feel
you don't want to be here.

- [rolls tongue]
- Let's rock and roll, bitches.
- How's everyone's nerves?
- I'm nervous.
- They're like, "Just let go."
It's hard to just let go.
They should have had us
bungee jump
before this challenge.
- Isn't it, like,
you'd much rather skydive
than sing live
in front of people?
- And get judged for it?
- They're like,
"Your skydive was horrible."
- Rock and roll, to me,
is just about having
that sense of abandonment
and just going for it
and just rocking out.
That's so the opposite end
of who I am,
because I'm afraid to be messy.
I mean, you guys know me.
I'm not like--
- Rah!
- Right.
I have been messy, and those
were very dark times for me.
The people who I loved
weren't loving me,
and I found solace and comfort
in something else.
When I first came out, there was
some tension between my mother.
I was getting the love
that I needed
from designer drugs
like special K.
I know I'm thankful
for my drag mother
for pulling me aside
and being like,
"Okay, you've become a monster."
- Like, "Calm down."
- "You are doing too much.
This is not who you are."
And it took realizing
that I was in the mess
and that demons can take you
somewhere,
but you don't have to stay
there.
You can come up out
and just move forward.
It's that strength
that got me here.
- Always when I'm going to do
a show, something happen.
- Oh, the zipper's broken.
- When I put my clothes,
boom.
Damn!
My corset explode.
- Hot-glue it.
- Boom, boom, boom, yeah.
- Turn.
- It's open in the back too.
Jessica Wild,
always something happen.
- The closer it gets
to being my turn,
the more
I just don't want to do it.
[laughs]
It's really freaking me out.
[singing scales]
- Everybody thinks
that I'm the one
that's going
to get this challenge,
and I feel great about it,
but if I don't do as great
as they think I am,
it's gonna be an issue.

- Ladies, that was
the best concert I have been to
in a long time.
It's time to hear
what our judges think.
Let's start with Jessica Wild.
- Jessica, you're a rock star.
You were into it right away.
You knew the words.
Your outfit's amazing.
- Jessica Wild.
- Yes.
- You killed it.
If there was some critique,
the hair, it's a little wiggy.
- You used your hair as a
weapon, which I quite liked.
And also I truly believe that
you connected with the music,
so I thought you were fantastic.
- Thank you.
- Great.
Okay, Jujubee, you're next.
All the girls said
you were the one to watch
because you could sing.
I was surprised that you...
didn't know the words
to the song.
- It's a pretty simple song,
and I didn't learn it,
and I can't take it back.
I feel like a failure.
- Terri, what'd you think
of Jujubee's performance?
- I have to say, you did
need to know the words,
'cause the words for us singers
are the lines.
We got to know our lines,
and there's no excuse for that.
People come and pay money.
- Oh, Jujubee, today you were
off your game.
When you first came out,
I saw your lips moving,
but I couldn't even hear you.
Like, you almost were afraid
to hear your own voice.
- It occurred to me
during your performance
that the music seemed to be
more like incidental soundtrack.
You went in and out
of connecting with the lyric.
- I think everyone is just
a little disappointed.
- I am so devastated,
because not only
did I let the judges down;
I believe my father was there
watching me,
and I let him down.
- Next up, Pandora Boxx.
- You brought it.
You were a punk rocker
out there.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, I think
your outfit looks great.
It wasn't the best performance,
but I could tell that you
put in a lot of effort.
- I liked the aggressive
punk rock energy you brought,
although, for me,
there was moments
where you kind of got
a little happy,
where you started kind of
hopping around like, "Yay!"
I'm like, "No, no!"
When you're gonna go out
with some attitude,
just remember to stay with it.
- Rock on, bitches.
[laughter]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- All right, next up,
Sahara Davenport.
Were some of the lyrics
a problem for you?
- Um, no, it was more breathing
and trying to focus
but not be so focused.
- I knew you were nervous.
I knew you were worried
about your voice.
I was like, "Oh, god," you know?
"Maybe she still hasn't
gotten over
being a little afraid of this."
You didn't know the words,
and that is important,
because people notice that.
You know, it's important
to them
that you care about the song,
because usually they're coming
'cause they care
about those songs too.
- You are very elegant
in that dancer, chic,
refined essence.
- But is that rocker chick?
- Well,
that's what I'm wondering.
I know it's probably hard
for you to let go,
because you do have
all that dance--
- Girl, I just did it.
I just let go, baby.
I mean, I don't know what else
you want from me, Merle.
I'm just a girly girl.
- Maybe I just wanted it
a little rougher.
- All right, next up, Tatianna.
- First, you were the biggest
improvement of everybody.
When we finished working
together yesterday,
I was scared for you,
because you were scared.
And you came in,
and you knew the words.
You brought it, and I know
how hard that was for you.
- Being Joey, I felt naked.
But as Tati, I feel like
I can do anything.
- T-a-t-i.
B-o-d-y.
Body, body, body, body.
You're still riding on
this body, and it's amazing.
I just wish you could bring
another element
to this overall look.
Bring it up to rock star level.
- Up next, Rockin' Raven.
Turn around; let's see
what you're working with.
- Oh, my god.
- Rock and roll, baby.
- Raven,
you come out with the ass.
Now I want girls.
You're hot as a girl.
- I've turned you
into a lesbian?
- I'm in.
- Yes!
- Remember at the beginning
of the season,
we were kind of giving you
a hard time about you're cold,
you have too much attitude?
Tonight you took that attitude
and you lit a match under it.
So it was like sneery,
"I'm better than you,"
but it was so perfect
for rock and roll.
- I enjoyed your performance,
because it seemed very much
in the moment.
You sold me completely.
- Thank you.
- Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
- Instead of doing
kind of hardcore rock,
which everybody else did,
you did glamour.
I think it worked against you.
I felt like you were
more concerned with your look
than your performance.
- I thought the performance was
dominated by your clothing.
It seemed to keep you from
connecting with the music.
I don't think you brought
the rock to it.
- Thank you, for everyone,
for your critiques.
- Thank you.
Ladies, while you're enjoying
an Absolut cocktail
in the interior illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
This is not gonna be easy.
- No.
- So let's start
with Jessica Wild.
- I thought she was fantastic.
It was ever changing,
yet she kept me with her
the entire time.
- Today I know
why she's still here.
- It was her conviction,
wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- Now, Pandora,
she did a great job too.
- She was unique in all of them,
because she just had a different
attitude than everybody else,
and it made her stand out.
- She came out, and she was
flipping us off and everything.
That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.
- She performed in a way
that I'd never thought, really,
Pandora could perform.
- Now, Sahara Davenport,
I saw her trying really hard,
but I wasn't convinced.
- I felt like she was playing
at being a rock star,
that she had, you know,
read a book about it
and so she was trying out
the moves.
I wasn't feeling
that she was really into it.
- There were great moments
where she lost her considerable
restraint and let loose,
but it wasn't consistent.
- Now Tatianna.
- I loved her look.
I loved that she tried for
something completely different.
You know, everybody thinks
rock is big hair,
and to me, it's about being
an original.
- It just kind of falls
in the middle for me.
I do wish that, you know,
with her youth
and beauty and body,
she would step it up
a little bit more.
- Now, I was very impressed
with Raven.
- Her look is just--
it's really intense.
I like that kind
of confrontation
that isn't necessarily violent
but it does make you deal,
'cause rock and roll
is about confrontation.
- Raven's guts
always win the day.
I thought it was extremely nervy
that she came out
with Terri Nunn hair
in front of Terri Nunn.
- For me, there were
two rock stars in this group,
and they were Jessica and Raven.
She just has that.
- Tyra.
- Tyra has immunity this week,
and if she didn't,
she would be lip-synching
for her life.
- She just kind of did, like,
a weak Beyonce imitation.
- And her twirling around was--
what are you doing, lady?
I don't care
if you don't like rock music.
Your job was to convince me that
you were rocking,
and she wasn't.
- The girl who shocked us all
was Jujubee.
- I had really big expectations
for her.
She's great.
We've all been wanting her
to win a challenge.
I thought
she could win this one.
- I did too.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought that Jujubee
was gonna do really well.
When I saw her walk out here,
it's like watching someone
do karaoke really badly.
- And then she didn't know
the words, and, I mean,
that just comes across
as a performer who doesn't care.
- All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Let's bring the girls back
to the main stage.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your rocker chick
challenge,
I've made some decisions.
Tyra Sanchez, fortunately,
you won immunity last week.
So you're safe tonight.
Thank you, Tyra.
Jessica Wild.
Pandora Boxx.
Raven.
As rocker chicks, you ruled.
But one of you
took this challenge
and turned it into
a rock and roll fantasy.
Jessica Wild...
congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- I am disappointed, because
I haven't won any challenges,
but I've been close
to winning each time.
- You have won
a $1,000 shopping spree.
But Jessica?
You have not won immunity
for next week.
Ladies, moving forward,
there will be no more immunity.
From here on in,
every moment counts.
- Of course I feel a little mad.
I win now,
and I don't have immunity.
- Being told that there's
no more immunity left sucks.
That's just going to show you,
"Look, bitches,
it's getting serious."
- Thank you, Jessica.
- Thank you.
Gracias.
Thanks.
[applause]
- Thank you.
- Pandora Boxx, you are the
Susan Lucci of this competition.
- I am.
[laughter]
- But you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Rockin' Raven, your star
continues to rise...
and you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Jujubee,
coming into this challenge,
you were the one to beat.
But you proved to be
your own worst enemy.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru is very disappointed in me.
I let her down,
and I let myself down.
- Tatianna, you were lost.
But once again, you channeled
your inner Britney.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- You know,
before when I was in the bottom,
I was freaking out.
Like I've said
and I'll say it again,
I came here to win,
and I'm not a quitter.
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm gonna fight it out.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync...
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

- Thank you.
I'm shocked.
Emotions take over me,

I know you will.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you all so much.
Thank you.
[applause]
I'm heartbroken
because I didn't win.
I learned so much about myself.
I learned that I got

There are big things in store,

- Congratulations.
There are six of you left.
I will see you dolls next week.
And remember,

all: Amen.

[alarm beeps]
- Oh.
- Look at this.
- "Live, love, believe.
Sahara."
It's your fault.
That why she is not here.
- How did it feel to finally
lip-synch for your life?
- I don't want to talk
about that.
Oh, my gosh.
The last challenge I...
sucked.
I never want to lip-synch
for my life ever again...
ever.
- You said you used to do
musicals in high school, right?
- I did.
- How were people with you
in high school?
- I was everybody's friend,
really.
I didn't really have...
- Were you out in high school?
- Yeah, totally.
Like, how--how the hell
am I gonna hide that?
[laughs]
- I got picked on
in high school.
They used to throw papers at me
and stuff.
Everyone referred to me
as "that gay boy James."
- In Spanish,
the word are more bad.
[speaking Spanish]
- You want to hear it
in my language?
- What?
- [speaking native language]
Doesn't that sound dirty?
Imagine being called that
by your uncle.
- Yes.
- Wow.
- When I was young, I--
everybody have fun about me,
because I'm gay.
I want to take dance class
before,
and I can't, because I'm scared
that my mom said,
"My son is gay?"
- I tried to kill myself.
- Oh, no, sir.
- I didn't understand.
I didn't know what gay was.
I knew I was totally different.
I felt totally alone.
I hated myself, for,
like, years,
and I thought that, you know,
"Well,
"I'll just take all these pills,
because I don't--
I can't deal with it anymore."
- I was pretty shocked
when Pandora shared
that she attempted suicide,
and she was really, really
depressed.
- But there's still,
once in a while,
that little voice that says,
"Oh, no one likes you,"
or, "You're not good enough."
And it's tough.
I mean, I don't think
it ever goes away.
The adversity that
I've gone through being gay
has made me stronger
and really has made me
who I am today,
and I'm really happy
with who I am.
- Can I get a amen up in here?
- Amen.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl,
you've got shemail.
[laughs]
Oh.
Hey, racers.
I want to read you
a little story
called<i> Drag Fun</i>
<i>with Dick and Jane.</i>
"See Dick.
"See Dick try on Jane's pumps.
"Strut, Dick, strut.
"You better work, Dick.
And they lived 'draggily'
ever after."
Now, that's my kind
of fairy tale.
What's your story?
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello!
- Hi!
- My exceptional girls.
Now, as drag queens,
we shrug off a lot of insults.
So when we get our chance
to throw an insult,
we turn it into a high art form.
We call it reading,
or throwing shade,
and it's part of our culture.
For today's mini-challenge,
you will read
your fellow queens.
The library is open.
- I don't read people.
- Of course you don't, Tyra,
'cause you're Christian.
Come over here, girl.
Here are your reading glasses.
Now, what I want you to do
is go down the line.
I want you to read
these bitches.
Read. Starting with Tati.
- Oh, wow.
We have Eminem doing drag, mama.
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.
And standing right next to her--
is that Dumbo flying in?
Oh, mama.
Is this Jujubee?
Darling,
let me get to your level.
- Oh!
- Oh, Ru, we have
a under-grown orangutan.
- Oh, and next to her--
Darling, how old are you?
And the one on the end?
Oh, just look at her, Ru.
Are you going swimming,
or are you doing drag, mama?
What is that?
- Wonderful.
The library is closed.
Tatianna, come on down, honey.
The library is open.
- Ugh. I don't want to do this.
- Go.
Smile for me.
Don't smile.
Do you pick up satellite
with those big ones?
[suspenseful music]
I can't do this.
- Dig deep, darling.
- I just couldn't think of
anything to say.
That's totally not my scene.
I'm lost. I'm gone.
- Tatianna got up there
and froze.
She runs her mouth about people,
but doesn't talk
when she absolutely has to.
I'm shocked
Tatianna's still here.
- The library is now open.
- You think that is big?
You need to see another thing
that I have for you, bitch.
You are so fat, girl.
[laughter]
What are you doing here, mama?
Go back to Chinatown, girl.
You are a<i> gringa, puerca.</i>
- Oh. Oh.
- You, the top model?
When I see your face,
I said [speaks Spanish].
- La biblioteca is closed.
All right, Jujubee.
- I'm not nervous.
I'll read a bitch.
I will read you to filth.
Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue cancelled?
Your grill is fucked up.
And, Miss Tatianna, Miss honey.
You think you're so soft.
Not by the hairs
of your chinny chin chin.
[laughter]
And let me tell you something,
<i>puerca.</i>
You won't understand this
anyways.
[speaking native language]
Get my gist?
Do ya understand?
Pandora...
Can we talk about sun tanning?
And you!
Legendary, you think you are.
Legendary?
Looks like leg and dairy.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
The library is closed.
Oh.
Okay.
Pandora Boxx.
- Tyra Sanchez,
if you are America's sweetheart,
America needs
a heart transplant.
Tatianna,
all I hear when I put my ear
up to yours is the ocean.
Jessica Wild.
Those drag clothes look like
a donkey funked a piñata
and threw up.
Jujubee,
with that gaping thing
you call an asshole,
I think I could go spelunking
in there.
- [gasps]
Spelunking.
- Raven, the frosty bitch.
I think I see penguins
circling that pole.
- The library is closed.
Ready for the flavor
of the Raven?
- You got a grill that could
put Black &amp; Decker
out of business.
- Ooh!
- Everyone thinks you're pretty.
I do think you're pretty.
I think you have
a beautiful face...
for radio.
- Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
- You want to call me
a top model,<i> mami?</i>
Bend over and take it
like a man.
I'll be your top...
model.
- Oh, that's cold.
That's cold.
- Honey,
don't you know a thing about
doing a manicure
and a pedicure?
Fix them hooves, honey.
Pandora,
by the looks of you,
you're going through the change
of life, honey.
- Oh, oh, oh.
She done closed the libraries.
Ooh, child.
I need to duck and cover,
'cause y'all bitches is throwing
beaucoup shade.
But the winner is...
Jujubee.
- I win! Finally!
- Congratulations, miss thing.
Now, I wanted to take
this moment
to introduce you to
Absolut image czar
Jeffrey Moran.
- Hey, ladies. How are you?
- Hi.
- To be the best,
you have to be daring enough
to do things
a little differently,
and we've done that recently
with a brand-new flavor
that we're gonna debut here--
Berri Acai.
And what we want from you today
is just that.
We want you to be
a little different,
a little exceptional,
because just like you,
we believe that in
an Absolut world,
every cocktail is
an exceptional experience.
- Now, ladies,
"exceptional"
is the word of the week.
Now, I've had the chance
to write two books
about my own
exceptional life experiences,
including my recent book,
<i>Working It:</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>
<i>Liberty,</i>
<i>and The Pursuit of Style.</i>
Writing a book is a great way
to let people know
who you really are.
For this week's main challenge,
you need to come up with
your own book,
an autobiography,
that highlights
the most exceptional moments
in your life.
They should shed light on
who you really are.
Now, later on,
you'll be working with
a team of photographers,
Idris and Tony, to create
the perfect book cover.
And I'll be back a little later
to check on your progress.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Jujubee.
- This is my creative
inspiration, okay?
- That's your thinking cap?
- It's my--
it's my thinking hat.
- Our main challenge today
is to come up with a concept
of what our book would be
and then design the cover
for the book.
- This challenge is so different
from all the other challenges,
because it's about us letting
people know who we are.
- I dedicate my book to Beyoncé.
- [laughs]
- This might be the turning
point for some people.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- How's your autobiography,
Miss Jane Pittman?
Do you have a title
for your book?
-<i> The Woman in Me.</i>
- Is this funny? Serious?
- It's more serious.
It's, like, how the woman,
which is Tyra,
helped me, like, get back to
loving people
and understanding people and
allowing people to love me back.
As a teenager,
I made mistakes.
I was out on the streets.
I had a son on the way.
So it was, like,
a little scary.
And to express it and put it out
has been a little challenging.
- Now, the cover of your book,
any ideas?
- I don't have any yet.
- If you want to be
behind this book,
you have to own it here.
Any questions?
- Nope. None.
- Okay.
Hey, Miss Raven.
- Hello.
- Do you have a title
for your book?
-<i> Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
- [gasps]
I love it.
- My favorite chapter is LTR--
long-term relationship.
The long-term relationship
I found
is the relationship with myself.
- Ooh, you're getting close
to home here.
- Yes, girl.
- Well, I would just advise you
to strategize
who you see buying this book.
[both speaking Spanish]
Now, what's your book about?
- A kid.
He always have dreams,
daydreams,
and at the end,
all those dreams
he make come true.
- Well, you know,
there are a lot of dreamers.
I just want to make sure
that the people know
that this book is about
Jessica Wild.
And a gorgeous picture
on the cover.
A title that's kind of funny
to say or cheeky.
So think about those things,
okay?
- All right.
All right.
I'm very worry
about my own thing.
I'm thinking in Spanish and
writing in English,
and I don't have a lot of time
for work on this.
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- Tell me the title
of your book.
- It's called<i> Tati:</i>
<i>From Teen Queen</i>
<i>to Drag Superstar.</i>
- Sounds salacious.
- It's about my life
prior to becoming Tatianna.
I started doing drag
when I was 14.
I came out in fifth grade.
- Well, it's a great story.
And a lot of people need to hear
that story.
How are you gonna convey that
on your book cover?
- I just want me on,
like, a big, huge stage.
I absolutely think people can
learn something from my story.
And I might have a little bit
more experience
than other people
give me credit for.
- All right,
so get back to your makeup,
and make a real pretty cover.
- All right.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hey, Pandora.
- Hey.
- So what's the title
of your book?
-<i> Out of the Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- It's about discovering myself
through dressing up
like somebody else.
- Mm.
- And really kind of finding
your inner strength,
and not listening to that voice
that says
you're not good enough.
There's a couple times that
I had tried to kill myself.
- Oh, honey.
Was there a turning point?
- Through theater
and discovering that,
I kind of felt people
that were like me,
and that's when
I discovered drag,
and I started to come out
of my shell
and be more open
and like myself more.
- So you can honestly say,
"drag saved my life."
- Yes.
- I always think of you
as the funny one,
the Goldie Hawn of the group,
and now it's--
it's interesting.
You tell me the story of
your dark night of the soul.
It adds depth to your character.
- I think that with a
lot of people that are funny
and a lot of comedians, there is
some darkness that's there,
because that's what they use to
combat that, was their humor...
- Sure.
- And their laughter.
- It's such a pleasure
to meet you.
I've read all your books.
[both laughing]
What's the title we have there?
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>
-<i> Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>
- My target audience
for my book is gay Asians.
When you're a gay Asian male,
they don't see you as that.
They see you as a woman who
was born into the wrong body.
That's definitely not me.
It basically starts out
with my childhood,
the discovery
of my homosexuality.
- Wait a minute. Hold up.
- I know, right?
- Your homosexuality?
- I know, girl.
And then I touch on, you know,
like, the loss of my father,
and then my move across America.
- How do you say "fierce"
in Laotian?
- I would just say Juju.
- Juju.
[laughter]
- Juju, huh?
- All right, ladies.
For your main challenge,
in addition to
your book cover photo shoot,
you'll be doing an interview
with celebrity journalist
Marc Malkin.
This is a really great time for
you to show off your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
You'll also be judged
on your ability
to seamlessly work in plugs
for your upcoming book,
as well as
the Berri Acai Absolut cocktail.
The more you can plug your book
and the Berri Acai,
the better.
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,
our special guest judges will be
two best- selling authors--
Gigi Levangie Grazer...
and the one and only
Jackie Collins.
Lucky, lucky, lucky bitches.
- Jackie Collins.
Are you serious?
She embodies what a diva is.
- And to quote
one of my favorite authors...
Don't fuck it up.
- The main challenge today
is to take photos
for the cover
of our autobiography
and do an interview.
- How you doing?
I'm Idris.
- Tyra.
- Nice to meet you.
- Tony.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- What would you like to do
today?
- Well, the title of my book
is<i> The Woman in Me.</i>
- They're in charge.
They're supposed to direct us
and tell us their vision.
- It's not just about a dress,
you know,
or how the girl looks.
they've got to commit
to their concept.
- The concept is three pictures
of me--
me holding on to the past,
accepting the present,
and looking towards the future.
I don't know how the other girls
are at photos,
but I'm very photogenic.
- You're melting
under these lights.
- It was burning hot.
All my makeup
started sweating off.
I was like, "Oh, shit."
-<i> 30 seconds.</i>
- Tyra's just--
she was melting.
If she were doing a workout book
where you had to be sweaty,
then, yeah,
it would be great.
- I was thinking of taking
the chest that's over there...
- Okay.
- And having me
coming out of it.
- All right.
So let's get the stuff.
- I want my book cover
to be funny,
and my concept is to have myself
coming out of a box.
Lust over me, bitches.
<i>- Okay.</i>
- All right,
so what are we doing?
- One here, one here.
- Just think about your time.
- If you guys want to,
like, face away,
and then just kind of glancing
over at me like, "Damn."
- Okay.
- Now, how do you want them
looking at you,
'cause right now they're kind of
looking at you
like you're crazy.
- No, like you want me.
[laughter]
I can't look at the pit crew
and direct them,
because I'm supposed to be
looking at the camera.
And they weren't
very cooperative.
So finally I was just, like,
"Get the hell away from me."
- Hello.
- Okay, I want to be sitting
at a yard sale,
and I want to sit
in that pink chair.
I knew my idea
for my book cover.
I'm at a yard sale.
I've got to find the shit
and get it together.
I want the award,
the radio,
the bust, and then this phone
right here.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What's the idea
for the book cover?
- I just want to look good.
- Whatever you want.
- Let's try to work
this shit out.
- Okay.
- That's mannish, isn't it?
- You look a little wide.
- Ooh.
- Jujubee could have used her
time more wisely.
She had extra minutes.
- You know, she came
out with one prop,
a fan in her hand,
and half the time,
that fan was on the floor.
What are you thinking about
right now?
- About my dreams.
- It kind of looks like you're
just standing there staring off,
so you really have to think
about all of your dreams
and let that come out.
[camera shutter clicking]
Honey, why don't you think about
something else,
'cause it looks a little...
- All right.
Oh, my God.
I love doing things perfect.
And I think I lost things
from my hands,
you know?
- What were your other ideas?
- What?
- You wanted to use
some other props?
- She kind of came in defeated.
- And if you come in defeated,
then you are defeated.
Think about something that would
pertain to your dreams.
- Can I take it?
- Yeah, of course.
You can take anything you want
from here.
- Nice. There you go.
Believe in it.
- I believe.
- What is this?
This thing is caught
onto my dress,
and I can't take my dress off.
They have to stop my time.
Immediately after photo shoot,
you have less than five minutes
to change
and get to the interview.
Jessica.
- What?
- Is it okay if I put on your
corset really quick?
- Yeah.
- Now I have more pressure.
Now I have a bigger challenge
to know that I only have
such and such amount of time,
and I need to get this done.
- There was a lot that went into
this challenge.
Tatianna didn't change
her costume at all.
She went straight from her
photo shoot to her interview.
I didn't really see an effort
in that.
- We need to talk about the book
or about drag life?
- The book and the alcohol
is the main focus.
The two really important things
during the interview
is that we have to pitch
the book
and the Berri Acai
Absolut vodka.
- How do you say
that berry drink?
"Acia"?
Berri Ac--
- It's acai.
- Acai.
- Acai.
- Acai.
- Acai?
A-ca-I.
- Guys, is it "Berri Acai,"
or "acai berry"?
- We're going to have
an interview
with celebrity reporter
Marc Malkin,
and as I sit down in the seat
and there's just a camera
in front of me
and they start to put
the earpiece in,
I realize
this is a satellite interview.
He's not going to be here.
- Oh, my god.
There's nobody here?
And he can see me.
But I can't see him.
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.
Where's the guy at?
- What's going on?
- Is this via satellite?
- It is satellite.
Why should you win<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm young,
broke, and fabulous.
My new book
is going to hit stores soon.
- What's this new book?
- It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>
- I have the full package.
I have personality,
I have sense of style,
and I have great, big,
white teeth.
- Why are you better
than the other girls?
- I'm better because I'm
Jessica Wild, and I'm unique.
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.
Oh, my God.
- So how many times have
straight men hit on you?
- Every time I've gone out
in drag,
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy.
Sometimes I'll be like,
"Back it up.
I'm a dude."
If they're just
giving a compliment,
I just say, "Thank you."
So I must be doing something
right.
- It's so exciting to be a part
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's almost as exciting as
my new book,<i> Out of the Boxx.</i>
- The book is called
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
I know how to love,
know how to give, and celebrate,
like I am with this berry
...drink from Absolut.
- I just got finished
writing a memoir,
and I call it<i> </i>
<i>Memoirs of a Gay-sha.</i>
- Where do you hide your candy?
- There's a lot of candy going
on down here.
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.
- Every once in a while,
I'll have a cocktail.
My drink of choice
is the Berri Acai from Absolut.
- Do you always drink
when you're doing media?
- No, it's my first time,
but I love that drink.
- What kind of vodka is it?
- Berri Acai vodka.
- Berry Absolut.
- Berri Acai.
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.
- Thank you.
And let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Oh, good luck. Got to go.
- The only thing
I might have screwed up on
is not mentioning the book.
But everything else, I felt like
I was--I was on point.
- Jessica,
thanks for being here.
- Thanks,
and I have my new book.
- What was that?
- The name is<i> Jessica Wild:</i>
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Fantastic.
Thanks, Jessica.
Good luck.
- I love that drink.
- Hola, hola.
- How your hooves be, Juju?
- How's the leg and dairy?
- Yesterday we had to read
each other.
I actually like
all of the queens that are here,
and to read them,
you kind of have to
make fun of them.
- I'm sure everyone's
had a little inkling
of their feelings hurt.
If anyone was offended,
I'm sorry
that I spoke the truth.
- I wasn't offended.
If you can't laugh at yourself,
then go home.
- It's hard to talk shit
about flawlessness.
[laughs]
- Since Morgan's been gone,
Raven all of a sudden decides
that she wants to blossom
verbally.
- Tatianna, did you just
not want to do it?
- No, I just couldn't
stop laughing.
These sparkling 30 years
that she's got behind her,
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.
She's just got to spread it.
- Like, Tatianna froze
and didn't read anyone really.
Do you think they're gonna
look at her and be like,
"What's going on, girl?"
- Raven might have been trying
to rattle my cage.
I think that she's been hoping
that I go from day one.
I did well.
I didn't drop my book.
I got the drink in.
I just completely forgot
about the book.
-<i> Tatianna's an airhead.</i>
She should have been in
the bottom two last week.
All she's been doing
the past couple weeks is this.
Just my opinion.
- Thank you.

And what?
- Hello, judges.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey.
- Santino, how are you tonight?
- We're gonna have a great show.
- We are.
- Now, Merle,
are you ready to hear from
our budding authors?
- I'm very, very excited.
- Gigi.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, darling.
Now, your most recent novel,
<i>Queen Takes King,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
maybe after tonight
you can write a sequel.
-<i> Queen Takes Queen?</i>
- Yeah.
- Okay. Co-write it.
- Done. Done and done.
And my buddy Jackie Collins
is here.
Hi, darling.
- Hi, darling.
- I love the title
of your new book,<i> </i>
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl.</i>
That's great!
- I should have dedicated it
to you.
- You should have.
And Absolut's image czar,
the exceptional
Jeffrey Moran.
- Hello, darling.
- All right.
Inspired by my new book,
<i>Working It:</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>
<i>Liberty, and the Pursuit</i>
<i>of Style,</i>
this week,
the ladies were challenged
to pitch us their autobiography,
design a book cover,
and field questions
from an entertainment reporter.
Tonight they're dressed
to the nines
for their book launch party.
Judges, are you ready
to take a look?
- Ready.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
<i>- The dress that I chose</i>
<i>is very skin-tight.</i>
<i>You can actually see the shape</i>
<i>of my body.</i>
- Is Jennifer Lopez
missing something?
- She is missing something,
and she'll never get it back.
[laughter]
<i>- I know the judges</i>
<i>look forward to me</i>
transforming my look.
- Oh, yes.
Style proper, Sanchez.
[cheers and applause]
Oh!
- No, she didn't.
- Poor little bitch girl.
- I'm glad my boyfriend's
not here.
I would have just lost him
on that one.
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
Now, Gigi,
is this a starter wife?
- That's the finisher wife.
<i>I don't think anyone</i>
<i>would ever leave that.</i>
<i>- I always make eye contact</i>
with every single judge.
It's, like, the complete
opposite of shade.
It's the "hey, hey, hey" look.
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Tatianna.</i>
Ooh, it's a jailbreak.
- [gasps]
<i>You know, they say never wear</i>
<i>horizontal stripes</i>
<i>unless you're Tatianna.</i>
<i>- I'm not really super</i>
glammed-out
<i>like the other girls,</i>
<i>but I'm thinking</i>
<i>I look really good.</i>
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>[gasps]</i>
<i>Oh, darling, yes.</i>
She's full of surprises.
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking glamour.</i>
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>there's still that element</i>
<i>of fun.</i>
- If Courtney Love looked
like a woman...
- Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
[laughter]
-<i> Jessica Wild.</i>
-<i> Now, she looks like a heroine</i>
<i>from one of my books.</i>
- Which one, Jackie?
- Lucky Santangelo.
-<i> Jessica Santangelo.</i>
-<i> Today is my party.</i>
<i>I love that dress.</i>
- Jessica Wild
from Puerto Rico.
<i>Raven.</i>
Oh, darling.
<i>That's so not Raven.</i>
[laughter]
<i>- I decided to go with</i>
something
<i>a little more super glam.</i>
<i>I feel like I should be</i>
<i>in Greek mythology,</i>
<i>and they should write a story</i>
<i>about me.</i>
<i>- A star is born again.</i>
- She has a politician lover
on the side.
-<i> Disco scandalous.</i>
Hello, ladies.
My<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>
<i>Tyra Sanchez,</i>
let's take a look
at your book cover.
Oh, okay.
What's it about?
- My past.
How I held on to it for so long
and held grudges against people.
I was a very, very mean,
arrogant bitch, that--
- And the problem
with that is...?
Let's take a look
at your satellite interview,
where we asked you to promote
not only your book and yourself,
but also the Absolut
Berri Acai cocktail.
- I know how to love,
I know how to give,
and celebrate,
like I am with this berry...
drink from Absolut.
- You didn't incorporate
the "acai" part of it.
- I'd rather not fuck up
the last ending of the name.
- If you're gonna be paid
by a corporation,
you should probably figure out
how to say the name.
- I'm not thrilled
with the cover of the book.
- I felt it was a little busy.
but I love the concept.
I was very happy to see that
you took it so seriously.
- Jujubee, let's take a look
at your book cover.
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>I'm Still Here.</i>
[laughter]
I just want to show people
that you can go through things,
take that negative energy,
turn it around,
and use it to live.
It's a lesson.
- Love the title.
I'm very big on titles.
My new book is called
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> so...</i>
But that is a great title,
and I think you'll attract
not only a gay audience
with that title,
but with a straight audience
who's interested in reading
about your life's experiences,
especially coming from
an Asian family.
- It reminds us
of a great book already,
so that was very clever
thinking.
- There's a lot of candy
going on down here.
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.
- By the way, I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls
who would like to, uh,
take you out, if you ever--
if you're ever available.
- Tatianna, you're giving this
not jailbreak,
but jailbait look.
Let's take a look
at your book cover.
- Ooh.
- Superstar.
- My book is about
becoming a drag queen at 14,
dealing with the backlash
from that,
but still going forward
and not letting anyone stop me.
- Now, where was that person
when you walked down the runway?
I'm a little worried about
your confidence level.
- This dress, it could be
three stripes shorter.
- Shorter.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm giving up
on trying to figure out
what's short enough
and what's long enough,
because...
- It's just slightly too long,
and it's starting to kind of
give a more
Morticia Addams look to it.
- Straight men love
to hit on me.
Every time I've gone out
in drag,
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy,
so I must be doing
something right.
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.
- Thank you.
And let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Unfortunately,
you did not mention
the name of the book.
Maybe it's fortunate,
because I'm not crazy about
the title of the book,
<i>Tati.</i>
Because Tati, I mean,
can be T-A-T-T-Y.
That's an English word
that means kind of not great.
- If that's the way
you squeeze in the cocktail,
we might have had a fight
in the car
on the way
to the next interview.
- Thanks, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Pandora.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- Oh, boy.
You got to use the pit crew.
- My book is about
how drag taught me
to gain self-confidence.
- Pandora, if you're wearing
this to be glamorous,
it's not working for me.
- This fabric is playing
with glamour,
but playing with, like,
funny glamour.
- If you're gonna look like
a coke whore,
take the joke even further.
- What kind of vodka is it?
- It's Berri Acai vodka.
- Missing my brand,
that was tough for me.
- Pandora Boxx, what do you
have to say for yourself?
- I just want to say that
my book,<i> </i>
<i>Out of the Boxx:</i>
<i>How Drag Saved My Life,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is now available online
and in stores.
[laughter]
- Jessica Wild,
can we see your book?
Oh, wow.
Look at that.
- The cover looks like
the cover of a book,
like, a nine-year-old girl
would buy.
It could be a little more
sophisticated.
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.
Oh, my God.
The name is<i> Jessica wild...</i>
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Your interview got into,
like, train-wreck territory.
- On there, it sounded like
"dreams of a golden shower."
Do you know what that is?
- No.
- If you don't know
what a golden shower is,
that's very naive.
[laughter]
However, I like the cover.
It's a little pretentious to
have an Oscar on the front of it
because-- [laughs]
Who knows?
- I'm not crazy about the cover
I feel like you could use
some of that Jessica Wild
imagination,
make a bigger splash
with that cover.
The interview
was basically so bad
that I wouldn't change a thing.
[laughter]
- Now, Jeffrey, you got your
product in there a lot.
- Yeah.
It was a little too sloppy.
I would probably have fired you
in the car
on the way home
from that interview.
- Raven, darling,
I love your fro.
- It was straight earlier,
but it's so humid back there.
[laughter]
- Let's see your book.
Oh.
- I've come from so many
broken things--
broken family, broken home,
broken relationships.
This is showing how to find
your inner strength.
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all,
I'm young, broke, and fabulous.
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
- Well, I am extremely
impressed.
Do you know how many times
you said the title?
Even I have trouble--
I do do it sometimes,
but that was really great.
And you did it with style.
You bought it right in right at
the beginning of the interview.
I loved that.
Good for you.
- You're so sultry.
I feel like you could teach me
how to be more of a woman.
- I think you could teach me
how to be more of a woman.
- I don't think s--
[laughs]
- I'm a man in a dress.
[laughter]
- Thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine turns]
Let's start with Tyra Sanchez.
- I like the title of her book.
[deep voice]<i> </i>
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
[laughter]
- One of the best dresses
we've seen this season.
And I like the book, and I like
that she revealed a little bit,
'cause we don't see a lot
of vulnerability in her.
- Uh, Jujubee.
- I thought she was dynamite.
He had a fantastic personality.
She came across as really alive
and bright--
very, very bright.
I liked her a lot.
- I think she probably crossed
over the good-taste line,
but we could have probably
lived with that.
- Tatianna.
- It did look like
she was part of a chain gang.
I'm sorry, I couldn't get over
the dress.
It just went on and on and on
and I thought it was hideous.
It looked like Olive Oyl.
- I didn't get--
pick up any confidence
from her whatsoever.
- Pandora Boxx.
You know,
she's been consistent
in her ability
to just be a real player.
But she doesn't take it
to that next level.
- She looks like a girl
that's just stepped off
the Greyhound bus
and quickly
turned into a coke whore.
- That sounds like a book
I'd read...
[laughter]
And Jackie's written it.
- Yes.
Yes, I've written it.
- Jessica Wild.
- Title of her book
wasn't right.
- I mean, she was hilarious,
but not on purpose.
But this is kind of
a serious thing
and it's like, you really have
to step up to the plate
or the dance floor,
as it were.
- This is branding.
Clearly,
Jessica did not understand
the intricacies of that.
Raven.
- She showed this great
personality.
and, uh, the hair was fantastic,
the dress, the book--
<i>Young, Broke and Fabulous.</i>
Not young, not broke,
but fabulous.
[laughter]
- There's a lack of
vulnerability, though, in--
in Raven.
- And there is such a thing
as overselling, you know?
She needs to practice
some restraint.
- All right, then.
Silence.
Bring back the girls.
I have made my decision.
Welcome back, ladies.
You are all my heroes.
And you know that I know
what it took
for each of you
to get here tonight.
So no matter what happens,
you are champions.
Tyra Sanchez,
the next drag superstar
needs to be
consistently dynamic.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jujubee,
you had us at "gay-sha ."
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna,
you're young and talented...
but you fumbled your interview.
And you came to the main stage
dressed like a referee.
- I'm sorry, my dear.
you are up for elimination.
- When I find out
that I'm in the bottom two,
my mouth goes completely dry.
I'm not ready to go home.
- Pandora Boxx.
The judges were not
absolutely impressed.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raven.
What can I say?
You're young, broke,
and fabulous,
and you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Congratulations, Raven.
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.
- I finally won
a fucking challenge.
And it was a big win to me.
Thank you.
- Jessica, you went wild
in your interview,
but your cover did not snatch
any trophies from the judges.
I'm sorry, my dear.
you are up for elimination.
- I need to win this,
because I don't think
that I did a bad job
for going back home today.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
to lip-synch
for your life.

and don't fuck it up.

[alarm beeps]
- Meow.
Oh, Sonique.
- Sonique was one of the new
friends that I really enjoyed.
It was tough
going up against her.
But at the end of the day,
this is a competition,
and I'm out for blood.
- Who's gonna take it off?
- I will.
- Oh.
- It'll be satisfying.
I am happy that Sonique's gone.
She just always had
a negative comment.
- So do it.
Clean my mirror.
[laughter]
- I won, and she got sent home.
So I really just wanted
to take in the moment
and feel satisfied
wiping her message away.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You should be proud
of yourself.
- A lot of people
don't believe in Tatianna,
and she proved to everybody
that you don't know anything
here.
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Hey, dolls, to prove to me
that you're the next
drag superstar,
you're gonna need to make
a real commitment--
one that could last a lifetime,
or at least until the next
best thing comes along.
Pull yourself together
and you could
have your cake and eat it too.
'cause when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
honey, we've only just begun.
Ohh!
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
all: Hi!
- Congratulations
for making it this far.
It's getting fierce up in here.
For today's mini-challenge,
we're gonna have ourselves
a little wrap party.
Now, each week
on the main stage,
you turn out one dazzling outfit
after another.
I want you to apply that same
creative genius
to these plain white boxes.
To "queenify" your box,
you need to use
the gift wrap we've provided
plus pieces from your own drag
wardrobe
and something that belongs to
one of your fellow queens.
You have 30 minutes
to complete this challenge.
And when I return, I'll decide
who has the prettiest box.
I'll see you in a few, okay.
- Juju?
- Yes, honey?
- Can I borrow your bird?
- Yeah.
I decide that I want this box
to just be a golden box.
Tyra looks over and she makes
a little comment and she's like,
"Oh, she's using the same
wrapping paper."
- The other queens
are copying my style
because the critique I get from
the judges is usually good.
Maybe I'm inspiring them.
Like, maybe they want to
be like me.
- Hey, Juju, think I could use
a piece of your jewelry?
- Go ahead, baby.
- Thank you.
- Can I borrow
some of your glitter?
- Go ahead, girl.
- Don't sprinkle
all my glitter around
like you did with the shoe,
though.
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
Ladies, I'm here
to inspect your boxes.
Can I hold your box?
The card on it says, "To Ru,
from America's sweetheart,
Tyra."
I love it.
- I chose the pink
because offstage
I'm a little more delicate,
a little feminine.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah, girl.
- Wow, there's a lot going on
here, Morgan.
- Yes, there is.
It's, you know, loud and fuzzy
and furry and colorful.
- Edgar Allan Poe
would be so proud of you.
- It's dark and sparkly
like RuPaul.
- [laughing]
Pandora Boxx.
- I like the pink and the blue.
It kind of says, "He?
Her?
I don't know what she is."
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Jessica Wild.
- Yes.
- Ooh, she's got a hot package,
all right.
So who is this a picture of?
- This is Gladys, my mom.
- Oh, really?
Oh, this is your mother?
- Yes, she is my gift
and my heart at the same time.
- Did you borrow something
from someone else?
- I took her scent,
and I sprayed the box.
- So you have the only
scented box?
- Of course.
- Oh.
- The colors are signature Tati.
I borrowed a stone from Juju.
Thank you.
And it has different dimensions
'cause there's different sides
to me.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, ladies,
I've inspected your boxes.
But I need to pick just one.

- Caw-caw, caw-caw.
- What?
- Caw-caw.
- Who?
- Caw-caw.
- This box is dark-sided.
[laughter]
I choose this one.
I want this one.
I'm going to embrace
my dark side, Raven.
Raven, you are the winner
of this challenge.
And now for the good part.
You may open your boxes.
Go ahead, open them up.
So far I've asked you to wrap
your boxes
using something old,
something new,
something borrowed,
and now this envelope.
Something blue.
- "RuPaul cordially invites you
to the wedding
of David and Raven.
Ceremony to take place tomorrow,
main stage."
- That's right, you are invited
to your very own wedding.
Yes, my dears, you'll be both
the bride and the groom.
In addition to customizing your
own fabulous,
dragged-out wedding dress,
you will pull together
your best male drag
using tuxedos provided
by Selix Formalwear.
Later, you'll pose
for a wedding portrait
courtesy of Polite in Public,
which we'll show
on the main stage.
And here come
the wedding dresses.
Wow, look at that.
So, Raven, since you won the
mini-challenge,
you get first dibs
from all these wonderful
wedding dresses,

Plus you get to choose the order
that the other girls
choose their dresses.
- Remember who helped you win,

Okay, who gets to choose next?
- I'm thinking it's me.
'Cause I'm like, girl,
I helped this bitch win. Mm.
- I'm gonna go with Morgan.
- All right.
- I'm sure everyone knew,
she's gonna pick Morgan first.
And I did.
So what?
Get over it.
Boo-hoo.
- I'm like, girl, that was
a mistake on your part.
- All right, Raven,
who goes next?
- Juju.
- Oh, my god, I'm so excited.
- [laughing]
- I'm getting married, y'all.
- Sahara.
Mrs. Wild.
- All these names
were being called.
I'm like, I'm gonna be last.
Obviously, I'm gonna be last.
Raven is jealous of anyone
that has talent.
- Ms. Sanchez.
- Ha ha!
- I like a challenge,
so I'm gonna go with
the ugly one.
- Pandy bear.
- And that leaves Tatianna.
Ladies, do you promise to have
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent
till death do you part?
all: I do.
- Then so be it.
I expect a "dragstravaganza."
Help yourself

Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!

- Tyra pushes
the wedding dress cart
in front of the fabric cart.
- Dear!
- Girl, you are so damn shady.
- Ah.
- Tyra pushed the rolling rack
in front of
the rest of the girls.
So Tatianna
pushed the rolling rack
on top of the girls.
- Ow.
- Miss honey,
that's dangerous, darling.
- Cutthroat queens.
Not so cute.
- Get out of my mirror, bitch.
- Sorry.
- The challenge basically is
marrying yourself--
bringing the feminine
and the masculine qualities
together
to make one amazing wedding.
- Tatianna?
- Yeah?
- You were chosen last.
I don't think it was personal,
though.
I should have been chosen first,
though.
- First?
- 'Cause I helped her win that
fucking challenge,
don't you think?
- In all honesty, yeah.
- But it's okay.
No hard feelings, diva.
It's all right. It's all right.
Every time Raven
gets to choose something
and every time Morgan gets to
choose something,
it's, "I pick Raven.
I pick Morgan."
Like, I'm surprised we don't
have a name for them yet.
Rorgan.
Maven.
Hey, Morvens.
- Is it corseted in?
- Douche bags.
- [belches]
Our wedding day.
- I think that the competition
is threatened by us.
I'm sure that
they're looking at us like,
"These bitches
might do a thing or two."
- Raven and I
are helping each other,
but we're still
gunning for the same prize
and we'll do whatever it takes
to win it.
- It's so funny no one
chose the dress that I wanted.
- Which dress?
- The one I got.
I got the ugliest dress,
and my first thing I did
was to go and cut it,
make it shorter.
And then less than,
like, 30 minutes later,
everyone is cutting
their dresses.
Sahara's dress
looks the same way,
and then Jessica's dress
looks the same way
and Morgan dress seems to be
going the same way also.
And it's just like, "Oh, my god,
you guys, be creative.
Be your own selves.
Be unique."
- Hello, brides.
all: Hey, Ru!
- Just checking in.
Now, you know, every bride
wants to look her best
on her wedding day,
so I brought in a pro.
Makeup artist extraordinaire
Mathu Andersen.
Say hi to Mathu.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Mathu has worked on some of
the biggest divas in the world
like Beyoncé Knowles,
Janet Jackson,
and of course, me.
He's here today to give you
some valuable makeup tips.
Listen and learn, ladies.
Tyra Sanchez.
Mathu here is gonna give you
some tips.
- I don't have a lot of notes
for you.
With a face like yours--
so beautiful.
It'd be so easy to take you to
completely unclockable.
I just want it to look
a little moister.
A little dewiness
just along the highlights.
Some of the other girls do it.
- I think it's because
the other girls' face get oily.
My face doesn't get oily
in drag.
- I do have oily skin.
I'm 30 years old
and I still look fuckin' 22.
'Cause I have oily fuckin' skin.
- Hello, darling.
- Wow. Look it here.
- You know what you're doing.
You know the shapes
you're going for.
The whole thing just needs to be
finessed and smoothed out.
And it is--sometimes it gets
a little bit magic marker.
I recommend always building
all your contouring
into the base.
- This challenge
is gonna be tough,
because I have a point to prove.
That point is I don't deserve to
be in the bottom two again.
- Hey, Pandora.
- Hey.
- Wow. Look at this.
I barely recognize this.
- Yeah, you said
you didn't want "off the rack,"
so I'm going way off the rack.
- Smart girl.
- You're super cute.
I think you could be
really beautiful.
Think Goldie Hawn, really.
Like--'cause see, she has, like,
a simple eye.
Lashy, softer, bigger
and really plump,
'cause you've got great eyes.
Play with that.
- Hi, Jessica.
Wow. Look at this.
- My wedding is going to be
an extravaganza.
- I love an extravaganza.
- Sometimes your face
worries me.
This is a problem.
Your highlights are so bright
here and here and here
that it looks as though
you have stubble.
Maybe it's about
putting the dark under
and then highlighting the jaw,
and really, there needs to be
a lot more blending.
- All right.
- Hi, Sahara.
- Hi, Ru.
- So tell me about your dress.
- I'm gonna cut it up
and make it shorter
and add some volume
to the bottom.
- Now that will go underneath?
- Yes.
- And you have enough fabric
here to support that?
- Uh, yes.
- And you're gonna pad?
- And I'm gonna pad, yeah.
- You've got
a lot of work to do.
- I do. I do.
- Yeah.
- You're so young in person.
- Ooh.
- She's a little old-looking.
Looking at your face now
and it doesn't have
the closed-in thing
that Sahara gets.
This thing always scares me
and this--
- How do I fix that?
- Try a little--something
that's just a little brighter
along there.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Well, hello, Tati.
- Hello.
- Your makeup's
all over the shop.
It's all over the place,
and sometimes it's beautiful
and sometimes it's like,
"What the hell is she doing?"
But you're so beautiful,
and you don't have to be
overly draggy.
And there's girls
who have made a career
on being that beautiful.
Just depends on what kind of
girl you want to be.
But don't rest on those laurels.
- No, definitely not.
- Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Juju.
- Hi, Ru.
- Wow.
I see jewels for Juju.
What do you call this color?
- Tawny sunset.
- Tawny sunset.
I love that.
- I'd like to see Jujubee's
version of natural makeup.
I use the Mariah Carey
reference.
And I don't want it
to be natural,
but I want to believe
that it's natural.
I want supernatural.
- Okay.
- That's your challenge.
- I will do it.
- Raven.
- Hello, hello.
- You won the mini challenge,
so you got to pick
your dress first.
- Yes.
- Are you happy with it?
- Yeah, I took
the whole thing up.
I started up here by pinning it
and hand sewing.
- So let's talk makeup.
- I would like
to see you introduce
a smidgen of color
into your makeup.
I can see that it's like, "Oh,
this person really knows their
way around their face."
But you could warm this up and
same with your jawline contour.
- Okay.
- Ladies!
Mathu and I will see you
tomorrow on the main stage.
And our extra-special
guest judge
will be one of
my musical heroes...
the legendary Martha Wash.
[applause]
- I'm so excited about
Martha Wash being a guest judge.
I have listened
to her music forever,
and I love her voice.
- Don't fuck it up.
See ya.
Come on, Mathu.
- Today we're shooting
our male half of the photo,
our groom side.
And then tomorrow
we're taking the bride.
We're gonna meld them together.
I'm excited to see
how it's going to look.
- There is slight anxiousness
because I'm not
the most masculine guy.
I never grow a beard.
I don't grow a mustache.
- You know, growing up,
I would sit there on the counter
and watch my mom do her makeup.
You know, I didn't really
watch my dad shave.
I was more interested in
the lipstick and eye shadow.
- You know, doing drag on top
of being gay, you know, at 14,
it was kind of an escape.
Like, I get to be someone else.
I get to be as feminine as I
want to be and then I don't get
pointed out for it...
um, or made fun of for it,
because a lot of people, you
know, didn't know I was a boy.
So this is gonna be just
completely different.
- When I did my makeup as a guy,
I knew I was the first one
in the mirror,
and so I went ahead
and I drew the facial hair on.
Then I look over and then
Sahara's drawing on
the facial hair,
then Pandora's drawing on
the facial hair
and Tatianna comes
and draws on the facial hair.
And it was pissing me off
because this is my hard work and
you're, like, stealing my idea.
So I'm hoping I go on the stage
first tomorrow.
That way, everyone that comes
behind me will look like,
"Oh, I got that from Tyra."
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Morgan.
- My name is Joe.
Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.
- So we're gonna be creating an
illusion here today.
- Story of my life.
- Just imagine that there's
another person next to you.
Look right here.
One, two, three.
Yeah, big motion.
Yeah, that's great.
- My groom is a punk rocker.
He just probably
rolled out of bed
and threw on a leather jacket
and a tie
and came to the chapel.
- One, two, three.
- I do feel comfortable having
to perform as a male, but I have
a little more confidence when
I'm in drag.
I feel a lot more glamorous,
a lot more pretty.
- There's been such a focus on
the girl, the girl, the girl,
that when it was time to be a
boy, I was so stressed that I
was like, "Oh, my god,
it's time to be a boy."
So I had to just push that aside
for a second
and consider the direction
that I want to go.
- One, two, three.
[chuckles] Excellent.
Nice.
- I am smiling in my picture
because if I have
the opportunity
of being married
with Jessica Wild,
I am going to be happy.
- Two, three.
Excellent.
Very nice.
Perfect.
Let's do one just for fun.
Two, three.
Excellent.
What inspired your choice
in outfit?
- Well, he is a police officer.
- A little smile.
- I'm really feeling
like a drag king.
Like, I'm not feeling
like a guy.
I'm feeling like I am a girl
dressing up like a guy.
- And you're gonna look
right here.
Two, three.
[chuckles] Excellent.
- How does everybody feel
about marriage?
Who's getting married?
Who's not?
- I'm not getting married.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm a bitter bitch.
- Well, with that attitude,
girl.
- I wanna marry my husband.
- You wanna marry your husband?
[laughing]
- I call him my husband.
I am in a relationship,
I do have a boyfriend.
I would love to marry him
one day.
Gay marriage is a human right.
It's our right to be equal.
It's not a, you know, luxury
to have gay marriage.
It's a need and it's a right.
But I tell you this much,
though...
gay people not being allowed
to marry,
to me, is a kick in the ass.

- Makeup's a lot better.
- It's my wedding.
And the makeup
helped me with the total look.
- Look at our daughter!
Our little girl's all grown up.
Tatianna.
Look at that keyhole

I hated it at the same time.
But I was still proud of myself
that I did something with it.
- She's a voluptuous bride.
The implants took.
- Yes, they did.
Pandora Boxx,

- Very romantic.
- I wanted to come across

that's very excited

And I'm going to be
very elegant.
And I want you to see

Hello, my blushing brides.
It's time to unveil
your wedding portraits.
Jujubee.
Oh.
What a cute couple.
- I hope you didn't sign
that prenup.
- Honey, he's rich.
- In the picture,
she's not really into the groom.
But I think somehow it works.
- Even though
there's a man in that picture,
it's still sort of
all about her.
- She's a man-eater.

Thank you, Jujubee.
- Thank you.
- Jessica Wild.
Oh, my goodness!
You've got yourself a hot one,
honey.
- They really
make a cute couple.
- They really are cute.
- The dress I like
except for the piece on the top.

go for the big

but I want it to go away.
I just want to see you.
- Pandora Boxx.
You seem a little tentative.
- I'm scared
of my first marriage.
It was either the option of
going to jail
or getting married.
- Oh, I see.
- Just doesn't do anything
for me.
- Really?
- No.
Marriage, going to jail.
Maybe I'd do the time
for a while.

- Huge bouquet, Tyra.
- The huge bouquet is because
it comes from
my last husband's funeral.
- Oh, okay.
- I love how big
your bouquet is.
I love the whole shape
and silhouette of your dress.
You were this close
to being bridezilla,
but you are perfection.
- What blows me away is that
you added this little...lace?
- I hot-glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.
- You're gonna have to
take a flame torch
to get that off of
there.
- You're like an old-school
drag queen,
but fresh and new to us.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- Ooh. He's hot.
He's gorgeous.
Thug love, baby.
- You're really fortunate
to have immunity this week
because I hate this dress.
- The face is so killer that
you want the clothes
to live up to it.
- Mathu, is this a "xana-do"
or a "xana-don't"?
- It's a xana-don't.
- Sahara Davenport.
- I remember being a little boy
who dreams
of a fairy-tale wedding,
like<i> Swan Lake</i>
or something very ethereal.
- I thought the presentation
was fabulous.
I loved it.
Dress I'm not so sure about.
- When you're not<i> en pointe,</i>
it's not a good look.
It looks a little crafty
and homemade,
and the fit is off.
- Raven.
Oh, how cute.
He looks older than--
- He's 36.
- He's 36 and you're 16?
- Going on 16.
- Ooh!
- Oh, I see.
- [laughing]
- What--okay,
then you're jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- Love that.
Love your turquoise accents,
love the bows.
You have the most expensive
looking dress up here.
- It's kind of like this fluffy,
girly, flirty dress,
but she's still packing a wallop
somewhere.
- It's under the skirt.
- Yes!
[all laugh]
- Morgan McMichaels.
She's a punk dude.
- I'm not sure
about the punk look.
- It's neither here nor there
for me.
I'm not crazy for it.
- It's more of a costume versus
a wedding gown.
I'm just not loving the shape
overall.
- You know, white pumps
are the sign of a true hooker.
And I love you for that.
Tonight's gonna be more
difficult than I thought.
And I need your help.
What are the judges not seeing
on the main stage
that we need to know?
Tatianna?
- Um, I don't think
that you're seeing
that Tyra's a complete bitch.
- That was frank.
- Thank you.
She has this diva attitude,
like I am America's sweetheart.
But she's not.
- I completely agree
with what Tatianna says.
I don't think that the face
that you see of Tyra
is what we're seeing backstage.
Everyone asked Tyra to be quiet
and not sing obnoxiously loud
for an hour.
<i>- ♪ Aah, ooh-ooh ♪</i>
- I asked her to stop nicely.
And she was like, "okay."
And then I walk across the room,
and it's like lah, lah,
lah-ah-ah-ah.
-<i> ♪ La ♪</i>
- She was almost saying,
"Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up."
It, like, really,
really pissed me off,
'cause she talks so much shit
about so many people
but won't say it to their face.
- You really
shouldn't play the victim.
It doesn't suit you.
You don't do it well.
- I was not doing that to make
anyone upset
or, like, make anyone unfocused.
- Bullshit.
- Then maybe next time
I will sing,
and maybe she'll get
another horrible dress
like she has on now.
- Tyra, do you think this really
has to do with the music
or something else?
- They're testing me.
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's like, kind of
pissing me off.
Morgan, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- No, I think you have a goal.
- Raven, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- No.
Sahara, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- I think sometimes
you're selfish.
- I think you need manners,
girl.
- Just because I--
when you give me a compliment
I don't give you one back
doesn't mean
I don't have manners.
- Girl, I know I'm gorgeous.
You don't need to tell me
anything, miss thing.
Just get yourself some manners
so you won't look
so damn stupid.
- [laughs]
- We're gonna move beyond this.
I think this is
another challenge
that we will all
have to overcome.
And we'll have to take it
into account.
Just promise me
we will be queens.
Now, while you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Let's start with Jujubee.
- I'm a huge Jujubee fan.
She comes out here,
she works the runway,
her style choices are always
very nudge-nudge, wink-wink.
It's charming.
- I think the dress
drowned her out a little bit.
You know, there was a lot
going on.
- I told Jujubee last week
to turn up the fire.
And I'm not sure
if she's turned it up
to full capacity.
Jessica Wild.
Now, I liked the dress because
it actually works for her.
- I didn't like the top part.
- The fan thing? Yeah.
- It was very<i> quinceañera.</i>
I think her style is pretty bad.
- Mathu, she did take your
pointers with the makeup.
- And I am well impressed that
she did do it.
She didn't have the heavy brow.
- Right.
- And she took her bang away.
- That's right.
- Pandora Boxx.
Now, Martha,
you did not like her dress.
- It didn't do a thing for her.
She just dissolved
into that dress.
- She went for a whole other
persona, this kind of--
- She took a chance.
- Bridal realness.
I thought it was a full show.
- My problem with
Miss Pandora Boxx all along
is it's like, um, blah.
Like all of her fashion
choices--
It's not even like, "they're
hideous; they're horrible"
as it's like, "Eh;
there you are."
- Miss Tyra "boom boom" Sanchez.
She's a showgirl.
She's the one your eyes go to.
- I was blown away.
- For Tyra, the biggest problem
is what?
- All the girls hate her.
- I think
she's a great performer.
I don't feel
a lot of warmth from her.
- Her attitude sucks.
And if it was up to me,
I'd vote her off right now.
- Tatianna.
If she did not have
immunity this week,
she would be in the bottom two.
- Hello.
- Yes.
- Tatianna gets the beautiful
thing a lot.
- Yeah.
- But she gets the ugly dress
thing a lot too.
She gets the ugly dress thing
a lot.
She's gotten that
more than once.
- Sahara.
Did not like her dress.
- Skimpy tutu.
- It wasn't enough tulle.
I mean, for drag,
you have to exaggerate things.
- Sahara was a little dry.
- Yeah, she was a little dry.
Raven.
I loved Raven's outfit.
- She was the other standout.
- She was the other standout.
Love the bows.
- I was loving her<i> Elle</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bride</i>
blue shoe.
- Morgan McMichaels.
I have to say
I did not like her dress.
- A pouf skirt
is kind of hard to pull off.
- She never does
serious fashion.
She always does costume.
- Did Morgan improve her makeup?
- She's still doing
her signature Morgan look,
but it didn't look magic marker
this time.
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring the girls back.
Ladies.
As we witnessed here tonight,
tensions are running high.
I will not tolerate problems
between my girls.
We are all in this together.
Now, based on the wedding
challenge
and your presentation
on the main stage tonight,
I've made some decisions.
Jujubee.
Today in that dress,
you owned everything.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jessica.
<i>Mucho escandalo.</i>
You are safe.
Tyra Sanchez.
This week, you raised the bar
on this competition.
Again.
Please do not
lower its standards.
- I'm scared that Ru is going
to look at me and say,
"Tyra Sanchez,
you are in the bottom two."
- Tyra Sanchez.
Congratulations, you're
the winner of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- In addition to receiving
immunity next week,
you've won a five-night
villa vacation
at the Hyatt Palm Springs.
Thank you, Tyra, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.

your bride would have been left
at the altar.
But you have immunity this week.
You're still in the race.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.

but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-sync performance
to<i> Carry On</i>
by the one and only Martha Wash.
Now, this song means
a great deal to me
because when my mother,
who had suffered
from a long bout with cancer
finally passed away,
I was listening to this song
incessantly.
It has a lyric--
mama said, never give up.
And I've used it as my anthem.
I want each of you girls
to know that,
even through adversity or death,
love and energy lives forever.
Now.
This is your final chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

- Get up in here.
- "Do you to the fullest.
Love, Tati."
I saw so much more in Tatiana.
She just kind of halted
and stopped.
- You gonna clean this mirror?
- Why do I have to clean it?
- 'Cause you out-lip-synch her.
- And you sent her home.
And that was your friend.

And it was the times

of the great bitchy catfights
of all time.
You'll be costarring

- You'll need to learn
to fight dance
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.
- And then with video director

- Plus, you'll work

How's it going?
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- Hi, I'm Ryan.
- The first thing
that we go out to learn
is the fight choreography
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.
- So let's go from the top.
Let's come up here.
The inspiration for this piece
was taken from the classic
TV show<i> Dynasty.</i>
It's bitchy, it's exciting,
it's campy.
So from the get-go,
it's a stomp, stomp, stomp.
You're a video vixen now,

- Circle, circle, circle,

and circle and circle
and circle.
- Fuck, I keep--
I forget that part.
I think it's gonna be hard
counting out those first beats
to know when we start circling

- Raven's a little bit slow
picking up choreography,
and that's a little bit
of a concern.
Click.
Other side, click, click.
- So it's--
- Not back to front.
- Okay.
- Let's listen to it 'cause
what--it's really fast, okay?
- Tyra's really monotone
with her attitude,
which makes me
a little bit nervous
because you need to be
hitting it in rehearsal
in order to hit it later on.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
This has to be bigger.
Don't fake it, yeah?
If they don't bring
their personality
and the steps are a little shy
of being what they should be,
it could be a disaster.
So and then I think from there,
you guys just kind of catfight
like true<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fashion.</i>
This is where it gets
really dramatic.
Five, six, seven, eight!
It shouldn't be
six, seven, eight.
It should be six, seven, bam!
And smack her, okay?
- Keep your heels off my toes.
- Keep your toes
under my heels.
I hope these bitches
don't take my eye out.
- And you're just gonna put
your hand on her wig.
So you have to really be careful
of her heels.
- The timing needs to be perfect
so it looks real.
- Hit, five, six, seven, eight.
Uh-huh.
Jujubee's overall realness
of being totally catty
and bitchy,
if she can really bring that
up to another level,
it'll be great.
Let's go back from here.
Just shake it down.
We have 15 minutes.
Let's go.
Ah, ah, ah.
See, you have to hold.
You come across, Raven.
You go one, two, three, four,
and look, six, seven, eight,
then walk, two, three, four,
to shove.
- Got it, okay.
- Yeah?
- When you're doing it
with three people total
and two of them are nailing it
and you're over there,
like, barely hammering it--
I'm thinking this is
gonna be a catastrophe.
- Okay, cool.
Thanks, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- I know y'all jealous of my
[high-pitched voice] boogie.
- Don't be jealous
of my boogie.
- Oh, my God,
I feel so fierce.
Did you guys ever think
that when you were a little boy,
that you were gonna be
in a RuPaul video?
- No.
- No, me neither.
I thought I was gonna be
a doctor.
We have a ton of stuff to do
for this video shoot, okay?
We have to do a scene
with RuPaul.
We have to learn the words.
- Ru?
- Who is it?
- Who is it?
Like, with attitude.
- Who is it?
We have to prepare
a fight scene,
and then we have lunch
with Ru.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tyra Sanchez, have a seat.
- Thank you.
- The other Tyra.
Two.
- Thank you.
- You've come a long way.
- What's been the toughest part
of this?
- Staying focused
and not worrying so much
about my son
and what's going on back home.
Like, and I'll pray to God,
and the tears just fall.
- Why do you cry, though,
when you pray?
- Because I just feel
that God is listening.
I held it in for a long time,
and, like, that's what made me,
like, angry.
- Anger is always
a symptom of fear.
What are you afraid of?
- I'm afraid of losing my son.
I really, really want to be
a better father to Jeremiah.
- So winning this contest
would mean what to you?
- I've been through so much
from being kicked out
to living on my own
and then raising a son.
So it's like a fresh start.
Just because I made mistakes
doesn't mean his life
has to be a mistake.
I was so surprised that I told
her about things in my past,
what went on with me.
Ru has definitely, like, grown,
to be, like, my drag mother.
- Thank you, Tyra.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jujubee.
How are you?
- Hi.
- What's going on? I'm Robert.
- Nice to meet you.
Robert Verdi is giving me
a consultation.
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
you smell so good
and you're so handsome."
- I'm gonna give you
an outfit to wear,
and I'm gonna help you pick out
an '80s look in your wardrobe.
You have to channel these
dramatic fabulous women
of the '80s.
Are you aware of any of them?
- No.
- What year were you born?
- '84.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- [mouths words]
What do you think you're
gonna do for this challenge?
- Does this do anything?
- These two things
go hand in hand?
- Yeah.
- It looks more
Ringling Brothers than '80s.
- I've seen
Whitney Houston's videos.
She just looked
like she was going to the prom.
- This has an '80s vibe,
but the shoulder would be...
- Bigger, right?
- More defined.
The waist would be more defined.
Who were the women
in the canon of history
that you look to
for inspiration?
- Honestly,
I look at Mary J. Blige,
and I look at, like,
the Beyoncés and all that.
- It's not really history.
- Yeah, and, you know--
- That's contemporary.
- I'm a little nervous.
I have no idea where to start.
- Hello, Raven.
- Hello, how are you?
- Have a seat, darling.
- We get to go have
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.
- Oh, a buffet.
- Yes.
- Would you like a mint,
darling?
- Just one.
- Just the one.
- There.
- Thank you.
Sitting there having lunch
with RuPaul
was one of the most surreal
things I've ever done.
- You know,
I wonder what it's like
to be sequestered this way.
Do you feel like
a prisoner of war?
- I mean, I do miss
talking to my mom.
I speak to my dad, you know,
a couple times a month.
I guess I'm closer with my mom
than I am my dad.
- They're not together.
- No.
- When did they separate?
- When I was seven.
- You know, I--
my parents divorced
when I was seven also.
It was really tough on me,
and I think I went into music,
into sort of
an imaginary world.
What reaction did you have
to their divorce?
- I look at my mother.
She's, like, my golden
Oscar statue, you know?
And I love her.
And when I saw
what she went through
with my father's divorce,
it killed me.
And I swore, I said,
"I will never do that
to anybody in my life."
And whenever I've gotten
into a relationship,
it's really killed me
because I'm, like,
"Why do I have to be
my mom now?"
And a lot of times when you're
with someone and they hurt you,
you don't want to have
anything else to do with them.
- Expectations
lead to resentments,
and when you allow people
to just be themselves,
the relationship
can really grow.
- It was very nice to sit there
and talk with Ru one-on-one
and it be about me,
not all about drag and shop
and all that.
- Our lunch has to end now.
Can we get a doggy bag?
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- Tell me about your persona.
Tell me about Tyra.
- Well, Tyra is, like,
sophisticated, glamorous.
- Okay, you're gonna be
shooting a video,
and your characters
are going to be styled
to look like they're
'80s vixens.
It was a decade of power
for women,
and women were really defined
stylistically
with very sharp shoulders,
very small waist,
and some bling.
- I wasn't born
when the '80s were hot.
I was born in the late '80s,
like, '88.
- You have the privilege
of working
with one of the most amazing
performers in the world,
who draws inspiration
from the most incredible women
in history.
And you should probably
take a minute to research
because I think you'll be able
to refine your character.
- Darling.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
- How are you?
- Have a seat.
- I will.
- How many
of these delicious mints?
- Just two.
- The two.
I'm on a diet,
so I'll just have one.
You were in the bottom two
three times.
- Three times.
- How did that happen?
- Well, I've been in
the bottom two three times here,
and I've been in the bottom two
a lot of times beforehand.
- Tell me about that.
- Just growing up, you know,
having people
just make fun of you.
I used to answer to faggot.
- Really?
- I just accepted it
'cause I knew it wouldn't stop,
and then finally, I just said,
"You know, don't call me that."
- Wow.
You know,
you got a lot of strength
for such a young lady.
What do you think your dad would
think of you in this contest?
- Oh, he would give me
the biggest hug,
and he would say,
"Go for it."
You know,
now it's Jujubee's journey.
Talking to Ru today,
she brought up situations
that I never talk about,
and it was just so comforting
to have her just listen.
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you so much, mama.
- All right,
I'll see you later on.
- So do you have
any reference point
for what this challenge
is about?
- I would picture
the Carringtons.
- You do picture
the Carringtons.
- Yes.
- So you do know who they are.
- Yes.
- Are you the oldest
of the remaining--
- I'm the oldest.
- So you actually have
maybe an upper hand in it
'cause you were more in tune
to this decade
than the other two would be.
- Yes.
If you want to work
and you want to have longevity
in this business,
you need to know a little bit
about everything.
- [laughs]
I love that jacket.
How many shoulder pads
are in yours?
- Two.
I'm like--
- Are you ready?
Are you ready?
- You got black nail polish?
- Mm-hmm.
Should I even risk it
and try to polish them?
- That's up to you, girl.
This is a competition.
- Let's make movies.
Okay, here we go.
- So I'm the first one out
for the dramatic scene with Ru.
- Action.
- RuPaul.
- Who is it?
- Step into her, Raven.
- RuPaul.
- Who is it?
- I really need to talk to you.
I know that--
I forgot what my--my line is.
- Cut.
And action on Raven.
- RuPaul.
- You know I can't see you
before the show.
It's against the rules.
- Well, I'm sick of your rules,
I'm sick of your challenges,
and I'm sick of your show.
- Cut.
Try and get a little more
roller coaster in your ride.
- Okay.
- Do you know what I mean?
- I'm sick of your rules,
I'm sick of your challenges,
and I'm sick of your show.
What about me?
What about Raven?
- I was a little disappointed
at first with Raven,
but she took direction,
and she paid attention,
and there was
an actual progression.
- What about Raven?
Oh! Oh. Oh!
Oh! Oh.
- Ru?
- Who is it?
- I am so glad
I caught you alone.
- Cut.
Can you just make it
a little more seductive,
just throw in a bit of that?
Action.
- What about me?
What about Tyra?
- Snap out of it.
Pull yourself together, girl!
- Cut.
I want you to play this
a little bit--
it's like
when she shuts you down,
be really hurt
when she slaps you,
be really hurt.
- Like, hood?
Like how hood?
- Go for it.
- Oh, hood or hurt?
- Hurt.
- When he said "hurt,"
I thought he said "hood."
- Well, do we want that?
- That sounds pretty good.
- I am sick of your rules.
What...about me?
- Snap out of it, girl.
You better pull yourself
together.
- You are just jealous
of my boogie.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Hello, darling, you gorgeous
little shoulder-padded monster.
- I feel 100% confident
about this.
I was a theater major, honey.
I know what to do.
- And action.
- RuPaul.
- I can't see you
before a show.
It's against the rules.
- I'm tired of these rules.
I'm tired of the challenges.
I'm tired of this show!
What about me?
What about Jujubee?
Ah!
[babbling tearfully]
- Jujubee came fully loaded
and a surprise
by throwing herself
on the floor.
- You're jealous of my boogie!
- But Jujubee
just is a drag clown.
Cut.
Cut, cut, c-cut, c-cut, cut.
- Right from the top, please.
- Would you do it
once more for me?
- What about me?
What about Jujubee?
- Snap out of it.
- [singing indistinctly]

I'm so excited!
It's us three.
We're the Supremes right now,
okay?
And we have to shoot
this video,
and it needs to be perfect.
Are we all doing bodysuits?
- Oh, those look too big.
- Raven and I got ready
so quickly.
- Yeah, you could see my
bathing suit lines in it.
Oh, well.
- We picked out our outfits.
We put it on.
I feel like Lucy Liu.
- I don't like these.
That looks too small,
doesn't it?
- Tyra had to go
through every fucking thing.
- Can I fit this?
Can I put on a tutu?
I don't like this.
Look at my stomach.
You don't buy stuff in my size,
do y'all?
- Girl, they gave me
these clothes; they fit me.
You're just a little taller
than I am.
Like, you can find something.
- This isn't gonna work.
At all. None of this.
I have so much to choose from.
It was just so hard
to choose something
that would top everything
I've done this entire season.
- How are you feeling, Tyra?
- They didn't have no fucking
Clothes to fit me.
And now I don't feel pretty.
- Action!
- One, two, three, four,

- I didn't pull
anybody's wigs off.
Tyra snatched
Ms. Raven's wig twice.
- My wig didn't come off.
I had it pinned on
the right way.
They knew we was shooting
a video.
- You got three drag queens
rolling around
on top of each other.
There's heels, wigs,
jewelry, nails.
Something's bound to happen.
- Ow, my eye.
Ow, ow, ow.
- You okay?
- Ow, ow, this one.
Is it bleeding?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- Open it up.
You want me to blow?
- It went right
into that heel.
Let's just give Jujubee
a moment.
- Do I look fine?
If I look fine,
I'll keep going.
- You look fine.
- Okay, let's do it.
- Fix your wig.
- [grunts]
- Yeah, I think she's got
the fighting thing down.
- Do I even have makeup
left on my face?
- Yes, you do.
- Ow.
- Yes.
[clapping]
- Y'all bitches
got your ass whooped.
- You okay, mama?
- It burns.
But I can't do anything
about it.
I just hope it doesn't swell up.
There's a cut right there.
And it's bruising right here.
I put makeup over it,
a little bacteria cream,
and I was like,
"Let's just keep doing it."
This doesn't look '80s to you,
huh?
- I think it looks more '70s.
I see Juju and Tyra,
and I realize they don't know
a thing about<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
or<i> Knott's Landing</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
or<i> Dallas,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> none of that.</i>
- Why wasn't I born earlier?
- So I think maybe I have
an upper hand
on what my look should be.
I'm channeling Lisa Lisa,
I'm channeling Kelly LeBrock,
and I'm channeling Tina Marie.
- All I know is
'80s style is tacky.
It's huge ass shoulder pads.
It's big unruly, ugly hair,
really tiny waists,
and fat asses.
There we go, dahling.
- The way that
I'm gonna pull it together
for the '80s challenge is,
like, they had big hair,
they believed
in their chandelier earrings,
and they like
the Lite-Brite colors.
Do I look '80s?
- Yes.
You look like you're going
to the prom.
- What's wrong, mama?
- Nothing, baby.
My eye is just in pain
right now.
- Okay, well, basically
what we're gonna do is,
you're gonna be sharing
the same space.
I want you all to write "no"
at the same time.
- Okay.
- So, you know, it's like,
"No, no, no, no."
Yep. You ready?
Okay, here we go.
- Standby, track.
Here we go.
Track in.
- Track, please.

- This is it.
- I know.
- So we all get into
the workroom this morning,
and we realize
this is the last time
we're gonna be walking in here.
And it's nerve-racking.
None of us can call it.
None of us knows
what's gonna happen.
- Did you honestly expect this?
- Yes.
- Me too.
[laughs]
- If you win, can you imagine?
- I know.
And it would gag
a whole bunch of people
that didn't believe in me.
- And that's the thing
I'm excited about.
There are those people
who are like,
"I think Raven's boring."
Yeah, so don't dance around it.
Don't sing live.
But I'm fierce at what I do,
so eat my fucking shit.
- How is it gonna change
your life, Tyra?
- I'll have a place to stay,
first of all.
And I'd be able to get my son
to come.
Like, he'll be able to stay
with me
and live with me there.
- Where are you staying now,
girl?
- Girl, I stay
with my drag mama.
I stay on her couch.
I need this.
I couldn't dare go home
without the crown and the title
of being America's
next drag superstar.
- So is anyone nervous?
- No.
Are you?
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
And I know being nervous
is normal and fine,
but I'm ready.
- [laughing]
- Hello, judges.
How are you, Santino?
- Doing great, Ru.
- Merle, how are you tonight?
- I'm nervous for the girls.
- We've made it
to the final lap.
Tonight, we're crowning
America's next drag superstar.
Santino, Merle,
you've been here
since the beginning.
You know these ladies
inside and out.
So tonight, there are no
guest judges, Miss Thing.
It's just family.
- Good.
- [laughs]
- Now are you ready for their
final main stage presentation?
- Ready.
- Bring it on.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Jujubee.
Ooh.
- Le pouf.
- I love this dress.
Oh, I was living for myself,
girl.
I wish I could have seen
my reflection.
- Yes, touch all of the skin.
- Touch all of the skin,
darling.
Oh...
I think Jujubee must have
bronzed her panties.
Ooh. Cabaret.
2010.
That's so Raven,
that's so cabaret.
- I feel fabulous.
I feel like, "Wow, I'm here.
I made it."
And I'm coming out
the way I want to come out.
-<i> Willkommen</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

And all that jazz.
Ooh.
Yes, mama. Style proper.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Yummy.
- Do you know
where you're going to?
- Yes. Mahogany.
I'm a winner, baby.
- I am so nervous right now.
And it hit me that, bitch,
you have a great chance at being
America's next drag superstar.
- The Beverly Hills Hotel.
- Ah, yeah.
- Polo Lounge.
- Yes. Poolside.
Oh, Tyra, darling.
Dive into the deep end.
Mm, the water's fine.
- [laughs]
- Welcome, ladies.
Tonight, one queen's life
will be changed forever.
Which one of you has
the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
to be the next drag superstar?
Let's find out.
Jujubee.
Let's take a look at highlights
from your final challenge.

I'm tired of your show.
What about me?
What about Jujubee?
- Hmm.
- Oh...
- Snap out of it, Jujubee.
Wow.
[laughing]
- Wow.
- Tell me about
the acting challenge.
Was it difficult?
- Not stepping into your light,
that was really, like,
my concern.
- Trust me, I moved all
the girls out of my light.
- If this was
a regular TV show or movie,
I would say, "Jujubee
is overacting like crazy."
But for<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> '80s,</i>
it was perfect.
- I'm a little let down
that you've chose to wear
this dress at the end here.
I get where you were going
with it,
but not the perfect dress
for this evening.
- I think the necklace makes
the dress look less expensive
and less fashion.
- Do you want me
to take it off?
- Sure, if you want
to take it off.
- No, no, I'll take it off.
- Let's see what it looks like.
- Yeah, you look
so much more expensive and chic.
- Oh, right, yes, it does,
actually.
- I'm gonna leave it right here.
- Okay.
Now, if it winds up
in my pocketbook,
don't hate me.
- Girl, there's
three stars missing.
You can already have it.

What about Tyra?
- Snap out of it.
The fighting.
[chuckles]
You were pretty rough.
I couldn't take my eyes off
of you in that scene there.
- Usually when you see
girls fight,
they're not worried
about being pretty.
It's, "I'm gonna beat
this bitch ass,"
and so I'm like--
that's all I'm thinking.
I just wanted that
to really happen.
- You snatched her wig off.
- I didn't do it intentionally.
It was like
I was reaching for her,
and the wig came off, but--
- You didn't do it
intentionally twice?
- [laughs]
- Love the hair.
Love how just open
and popping your face is.
It's really stunning.
Overall, I think
it's a great look.
- Now, are you gonna let
your son watch this show?
- I think that this might be
the first time
that he realizes
what daddy does.
And I'm--I'm pretty sure
he's gonna--
we're gonna sit down
and watch it together.
- All right, Tyra.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Now let's move on
to Miss Raven.

What about me?
What about Raven?
- Come here.
Closer.
Let mommy make it better.
That was just too good
to pass up!
What was the toughest part
about the acting challenge?
- Looking at your face.
- [laughs]
I get that a lot.
[laughs]
- You always looked beautiful,
but that was--
probably the hardest part
was looking at your face
and trying not to just be
like--
- [laughing]
Now, what are you serving us
on the main stage tonight?
- Well, I have this corset,
and I think this just
kind of speaks for itself.
- What does it say?
- I'm the next drag superstar.
- [laughing]
- Don't slap me again,
please.
[laughter]
- I'm so in love
with this outfit.
I love a black, like,
floral thing
because you expect organza
and petals
to be kind of pink.
And when they're black,
it's kind of like this
weird Gothic feeling.
- In the fight scene,
there was a period of time
over a minute
where I couldn't even see you.
Tyra was standing up,
and, like, you kind of got lost.
- I didn't want to hurt anyone,
so I didn't go for it
completely.
- Your '80s look,
it was totally '80s.
If there's any time
in this whole competition
that you really looked
like Kelly LeBrock,
it was--
it was that time.
- All right.
Thank you.
Ladies.
While you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[car engine turns over]
Okay, here we are
at the moment...
- Oh, my God.
- That it all boils down to.
Let's start with Jujubee.
She has star quality.
- Mm-hmm.
- But is she
the next drag superstar?
- To me, in the context
of these three people,
she looked a little bit
like a tourist.
Her level of iconography
in terms of fashion and beauty
is not where the other two's is.
- She excelled
in the book challenge
because she's a clever girl.
She's clearly the most
intelligent of all the girls.
- I'm not sure.
- Really?
- I think Tyra
is incredibly intelligent.
- Let's talk about Tyra.
She's not polished.
She is very hood.
She's very street.
But the fact that she's learned
these old-school tricks
that we've seen displayed
on this stage
at such an early age
and wowed us with them--
even her tenacity to
"accidentally" rip her wig off,
you know, she's saying,
"I'm here."
- Right.
- "I'm the star."
- I love people
who are the shit
and know they are the shit.
I get both of that from--
from Tyra and Raven.
- Yeah.
- I just think her personality
is so interesting and complex.
And that is part of stardom.
- She's been able to show us
so many different looks
and be
so many different women.
- Raven is really more
the fashion-forward girl.
Raven has
undeniable star quality.
- Superstar quality.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, normally right now,
I would say
I've made my decision.
But I can't say that I have.
I must see them lip-synch
for their lives
to make my decision.
Silence.
Bring back...my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
We've reached that point
in our journey
where one path ends
and another begins.
I'm so proud
of each and every one of you.
- It almost seems like
RuPaul's got a shotgun
and is just waiting to, like,
"Okay, you're not it,
you're not it."
That's what it feels like,
a sitting duck.
- Jujubee.
You've brought a light
to this competition
week after week,
a light that nothing
and no one can extinguish.
You are a bright star.
But sadly, you are not
the next drag superstar.
I'm sorry, Juju.
- Thank you.
- We will see you soon.
But for now, sashay away.
- Bye.
I'm not bitter.
I'm disappointed.
I wish I was up there
lip-synching.
But I'm still a winner,
and I'm proud of my girls.
I'll get my time.
"Love, Juju...B."
- Tonight, my two best girls
will lip-synch to my single
<i>Jealous of My Boogie.</i>
- This is my first time
I'm gonna have to lip-synch.
I am so nervous right now.
- Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me
and win the title
of America's
next drag superstar.
- I'm ready to win this shit.
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck.
And for the last time,
don't fuck it up.

Bravo, brava.
- Brava.
- That was amazing.
- Wow.
- Ladies.
I have made my decision.
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
America's next
drag superstar, is...
Tyra Sanchez.
[applause]
- Oh, my God.
[hyperventilating]
- Girl, turn to the camera.
You want to take your shoes off?
Girl.
Do you need someone?
Can we get someone over here,
please?
She can't breathe. Literally.
- [continues hyperventilating]
- Tyra, you're gonna be okay.
- Are you okay?
- Okay, do you need water?
Do you need--
Does she need to breathe
in the paper bag?
- [exhales deeply]
It's like I had
an out-of-body experience
and I just--
for some reason,
I forgot to breathe.
- Just relax for now, Tyra.
We're gonna get your wig
back on your head.
Take your time, baby.
Tyra, you're gonna be okay.
We're gonna continue.
Raven.
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.
You are unforgettable.
And that...is so Raven.
- Thank you.
- Good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Now sashay away.
- [silently] Thank you.
I came in second place.
That's an amazing thing
out of 12 people.
I'm gonna leave this competition
with my head held high.
I'm gonna go off
and do something fierce,
fabulous, fun, and funky,
the four Fs.
- My queen.
- Go girl.
Yes!
- Wear this crown with pride.
The other Tyra is dead.
Long live the new Tyra.
[applause]
All right.
- Being America's
next drag superstar
is going to change my life
dramatically.
I'll be able to take care
of Jeremiah,
and I'll be able to start
his future now.
- Tyra, let the world be
jealous of your boogie.
Now walk.
[applause]
- I am Tyra "the other Tyra"
Sanchez.
And I am America's next drag...
superstar.

- Welcome to an extra special
episode of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Honey, this hour is jam packed.
- Face.
- Face.
- Beauty face.
Because when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
too much is never enough.
- $5.00.
Try something new.
- But before we race
to the finish line,
let's go back
and pay our respects
to the nine amazing queens
that didn't make it
to the winner's circle.
- Hey, everybody,
look at me.
Here I am.
- We are in my home.
I'm gonna show a few
of my things to you.
- Hey, RuPaul
and casting directors.
- I'm the one
you're looking for!
- Now, when Shangela
sent in her casting tape,
she'd been doing drag
for only three months.
- Now, you have to forgive me
because I had to drag myself
out of bed
to pull this video together.
[sniffles] Bitch think
he got the swine flu.
[sniffles]
- But what she lacked
in experience,
she made up for in enthusiasm,
showmanship,
and attitude.
- Some bitches,
when they in drag,
they are catty,
hateful hos.
But nobody likes a hateful ho.
Mm-mmm.
No, you need to be sweet
to people.
Girl, I got diesel breath.
[laughter]
- It's every single...
- Our next queen,
Nicole Paige Brooks,
was tasteful
and sophisticated.
In short, Atlanta eleganza.
- Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!
We just started,
and y'all are already breaking
my number one rule,
which is what?
If I can hear you over me,
you need to what?
- Shut the fuck up!
- You may remember me
from<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season one,
when I almost made it,
and you got to see
my audition video on the show.
Just in case you don't remember,
here it is.
My name is Nicole--
my name is Nicole--
my name is Nicole Paige Brooks.
RuPaul.
- RuPaul.
- I need you to pick dada
this time.
- I need you
to pick dada this time.
- [laughing]
- We knew we loved
the marvelous Mystique
from the moment she shared
her most important
beauty secret--
two piece and a biscuit.
- Well, I already ate
that one piece,
and here's the other,
you know.
That two piece and a biscuit
can give you hips and curves
and everything else.
Drag for me
is a creative outlet,
and it's an expression on life,
and it's the art
of the illusion.
You know I'm a size 0,
the infinite number?
-<i> ♪ Cover girl ♪</i>
<i>♪ Put the bass in your walk ♪</i>
<i>♪ Head to toe ♪</i>
<i>♪ Let your whole body talk ♪</i>
- Gotta eat that breast
and that biscuit
just to keep
that girlish figure.
Smooches.
- The lady Sonique
was nothing if not versatile.
She rocked so many looks,
she had us flippin' out.
- That's my Catwoman mask.
My new Catwoman mask.
Actually, the Black Cat.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, yeah.
- These are my drag mother's
fire torches.
I gotta show you those.
[blowing]
- I knew that Morgan McMichaels
was my kind of queen
when she invited us
to check her out
in a back alley.
- My favorite place to walk
and give you a catwalk show
is in the alley.
I'ma start from way back here.
-<i> ♪ Stroll down the runway ♪</i>
<i>♪ Another payday ♪</i>
<i>♪ Cover of magazines ♪</i>
- So we're on a tour.
This is<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in a audition video,
and this is my closet,
ladies and gentlemen.
We have bags of hair,
leather chaps,
leather leather,
leather leather shiny things.
You know drag queens
love shiny things.
- Sahara Davenport's
audition tape
showed some sass,
some class,
and even a little bit of ass.
- Hi!
I'm Sahara Davenport!
Drag means, to me, freedom
of expression definitely.
What I can say
is drag has taken me places
where my career as a dancer
was unable to.
If I had to describe Sahara,
I would say
she has the grace
of Debbie Allen.
Whoo!
And she's a big ol' man,
like RuPaul.
[laughing]
- Sexy Latina Jessica Wild
earned her spot on the show
by winning
an online casting contest
at rupaulsdragrace.com.
- For me, Jessica
is a gift to myself,
because it gave me opportunity
to do things that as David
I was afraid to do.
- In drag,
comedy and timing
can be as important
as a tight tuck.
Pandora Boxx's
hilarious audition tape
proved she understood
the importance of all three.
- Tell us, Pandora Boxx,
what is the secret
to your success?
- Well, Michael, you see--
Oh, hold on.
I hope you don't mind
if I do something.
- Uh...okay.
- I'm 37 years old...ooh.
I just--that's the first time
I think I've said it out loud.
It's only been a week.
I don't know if you know,
but I did audition last year.
I didn't make it, clearly,
and I'm not bitter.
It's a kind of like
a little, um...
like a Swiss Miss kind of--
well, it's best
I just show you.
[claps]
Here I am.
<i>♪ Yodelay, yodelay ♪</i>
<i>♪ Yodelay-ee-hoo ♪</i>
- Tatianna's audition tape
was second to none
when it came to femininity
and sheer beauty.
- And if I don't get chosen
this time,
I'm gonna try again
next season
and the season after that
and the season after that.
And you're eventually
going to get tired
of seeing my face,
so it's in your best interests
just to get it over with now
and put me on the show, 'kay?
- All these girls
have sashayed away,
but even though
they left the race,
they're still
spreading the love,
and you can catch their acts
all over the country.
Find out where.
Just go to rupaulsdragrace.com
and click.
- Can I get a amen.
-<i> ♪ A-a-a-a-men ♪</i>
Oh!
- This year's queens
tore up the main stage
like never before.
And to help me
count down the top ten
most unforgettable
fits and fashions,
I've invited
three unforgettable queens
from last season--
the divine Ongina,
the fabulous Shannel,
and last season's winner,
the queen herself,
the incredible
BeBe Zahara Benet.
Cameroon!
[laughter]
Hi, ladies.
- Hi, Ru.
- Welcome back
to the<i> Drag Race.</i>
- Thanks for having us.
- Shannel, you moved
to another city.
- Seattle.
- Now, did<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
change your life?
- The world.
All three of us--
we've just been in every city,
and it's been--
it's been amazing.
- Yeah, I've been reading
about you all,
and, BeBe, you moved
to a new city, too, didn't you?
- New York.
- People recognize you
on the street?
- Yeah, and that's
overwhelming too.
- So you've been watching
the show.
- Crazy 12 girls
you have there.
- I put together
the top ten list
of the most unforgettable
fits and fashions
on the runway.
Coming in at number ten
are the death-defying drops
of Miss Two Piece and a Biscuit
herself, Mystique.
Whoa!
Wow.
It always felt like she was
gonna break something.
- She dropped it
like it was hot.
- She sure did.
[laughter and applause]
Now, do any of you
do splits at all?
- Mm-mm.
- No?
I would think you could,
Shannel.
- I'll juggle, but no splits.
- Yeah, only in the comfort
of my own bedroom.
- [laughing]
- Honey, she had one foot
on the dresser.
- I think big girls
are always fabulous, though.
- Being a big girl,
you knew
that she had to pull out
all the stops.
- She's pretty too.
- She is pretty.
- Very pretty.
She's not afraid
of the cosmetics.
- No.
- She will get in there,
and she'll paint
for the Rose Bowl, honey.
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes.
She baked it
like Betty Crocker.
She did a thing
called cooking her makeup.
Do you guys cook?
- I mean, the queens
have to cook.
- Well, it's when you put
your foundation on your face
and you let it sit and warm to
your own body's temperature...
- I never knew that.
- So that it's--yeah.
- I cook.
- I'm cooking right now,
right?
I'm actually wearing
a Crock-Pot right now.
- Oh, okay.
- [laughs]
- Bet you can't guess
where it is.
- [laughs]
- I'll give you a hint.
It's near my lovin' oven.
[all laugh]
- I really like
her personality.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Now, after the burlesque show,
we asked our girls
to walk the runway
in their best high-class drag.
Coming in at number nine
is Miss Tatianna,
who brought it home
in Galliano realness.
Now, what did you think
of her dress?
- It was prom-y,
a little too short.
- I would've liked it
to have swept the ground.
- And a little train.
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe not the earrings
with the necklace.
- But, you know,
give or take a necklace
or an earring or two,
that was one of her best looks.
Now, everybody knows my girls
are the crème de la crème,
but coming in at number eight
is Miss Jujubee in her getup
from the
Starrbootylicious episode.
Now, Jujubee was wearing her
"Imelda Marcos goes to the prom
in the Ashford &amp; Simpson
collection from Sears" dress,
but it was gorgeous.
You know, normally
that could not work,
but something about her humor
pulls that off.
- She seemed very bubbly
and kind of peppy.
I think she paints
really, really well.
- Reminds me
of a little Ongina.
[laughter]
- I like her
because she's Asian.
So go, Asians!
- Without the hair.
- Well, yeah.
No, she's--
I really like that dress.
- Yeah.
- I mean, you know,
if I wore that dress,
it would probably drown me,
but for her, it works.
- It works for her.
- And I think it's gorgeous.
- And, you know,
there's a certain consciousness
that Jujubee has that is, um...
it's kind of got a wink
to everything that she does,
and it made it work.
- She was a real transformation,
too, from boy to girl.
- I was surprised.
- Big difference there.
- Yes.
- Big difference.
- Yeah.
I think with a lot
of the kids this season
that the difference is huge.
- Yeah.
- I like her boy name too.
It's Airline.
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah, it's amazing.
- Yeah.
- No, I think that her--
She could actually use her
boy name as a drag name, yeah.
- Sure.
- But Jujubee is great.
- Jujubee is fantastic.
Do you know the meaning
of "jujubee," what that means?
- No.
- I think it's a--
- It's a candy.
- Yes, well, the--
it is, I think, in Thailand,
the truckers who are
traveling cross-country
chew this candy to stay awake
at night.
- Because it gets stuck
in your teeth
and then you can't even separate
your gums,
and you spend more time
picking it out of your teeth
than you do swallowing it.
- She has pizzazz,
and she's always going, "Pah."
- In the Country Queens episode,
Jessica Wild's country couture
left the others in the dust,
and it has her coming in
at number seven.
Was she bootylicious or what?
- Hip-alicious, bootylicious--
she's padded for life.
- Now, of course,
she was padded.
Now, you don't pad,
do you, Ongina?
- No.
- And, of course, Shannel
doesn't need to pad,
because she's got it.
- Junky trunk, right?
- Now, um, our queen--
any tips for padding
for the kids out there?
- Um, I don't pad.
- Oh, you don't pad?
[laughter]
- I don't pad.
- That's a lie.
- Do you think
that Jessica's pad job
was acceptable by our queen?
- Well, you know what?
- I just--of course it's due.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I think it was--yeah.
It was realistic,
but then again,
you have to figure out
how tall you are
and how short you are
to make it that realistic.
- Right.
- You know?
- So I shouldn't get that made.
- Well, you can get it made,
but you have to--
- In that size.
- You can make it to your body.
- Oh, okay.
- Right.
- Some girls, you know,
only pad here
when they really should pad,
like, say, from the knee up,
or they may have--
They may--a lot of times,
girls, I think
will put their pads too low,
too,
because they want to hear
a lot of hip hugger things.
And then they've got, you know,
an ass that sits on the ground,
which, I mean,
I'm the last one to talk,
but, you know, see...
- Well, I think that Jessica
did her padding very well
this time.
Now, we asked our judges
to work the runway,
and divas like Kathy Griffin,
Dita Von Teese,
and Miss Debbie Reynolds
showed us queens a thing or two
about being fabulous.
Coming in at number six
are the stunning runway stylings
of our<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> judges.</i>
What'd you think
of our star power
on the runway this year?
- Kathy Griffin coming out
with the damn bar--
but I love
Debbie Reynolds too.
- Debbie Reynolds.
- Oh, my God, she's adorable.
- She introduced herself
as Princess Leia's mother.
And Henry Rollins--he gets
sexier with age, actually.
- If you need a housekeeper.
- Talking about sexy,
Dita Von Teese...
- Oh, yes.
- Amazing...
- Yeah, true living pinup.
- In the Rocker Chick challenge,
my girls had
to transform themselves
into rock star divas.
And together, they come in
at number five
on the countdown.
- I was really impressed
with Raven and Tatianna.
-<i> ♪ This groove</i>
<i>is for my girls ♪</i>
<i>♪ Little lady boys and girls ♪</i>
- Especially Raven--
I think that the hair was just--
the color contrast
was really hot.
- Well, she was paying homage
to Terri Nunn,
who was from the group Berlin,
and that was Terri Nunn's
trademark hairdo.
Now, I know that you did
the rap on my song.
- Yes.
- And you have a song out now.
- Yeah.
- What's it called?
-<i> I'm the Shit.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, God.
[laughter]
Now there were a lot of looks
this season
that drew inspiration
from history's
greatest superstars.
But in the Once Upon a Queen
episode,
a star was born,
and that's why Raven
is number four
on the countdown.
- I love Raven, and I also am
a huge Streisand fan.
So I loved it
'cause it was<i> Goldmember</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
meets<i> The Main Event.</i>
- It was a very surprising look
for her.
- She took out her piercing.
- She took out her piercings.
- Which made the look
a little bit more high glamour,
because if she would have
kept them on,
then it would have not worked
for me.
- Although I kind of
secretly would love
to see Barbra Streisand
with those piercings.
- Yeah.
- Can you imagine?
- Yeah.
Maybe she is pierced...
Down there.
[laughter]
- For the busy drag queen
on the go,
versatility is a must.
So I love it
when a single outfit
suddenly turns into two
or three or more.
Coming in at number three,
behold the many country looks
of Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
- If you're going to work
with the first outfit
and then you have to run out
to lunch
on the second outfit
and then dinner on the third--
- Right, and then
the escort agency calls.
[laughter]
- I like reveals,
because I think it keeps you
very interested
and it's, like,
the "oohs" and the "ahhs"
and really gives you
that whole showgirl
aspect of it.
- Yes.
In season one,
there were a few little spats
between the contestants.
Right, girls?
- Maybe.
- Just a few.
Well, this season,
we had a shootout
at the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Corral.</i>
Coming in at number two,
it's the terrible Ts,
Tyra versus Tatianna.
What are the judges not seeing?
- Tyra is a complete bitch.
- She talks so much shit
about so many people
but won't say it
to their face.
- The reality is in this field
there is so much cattiness.
After having been dressed
for so many hours
and under the lights
and all of that,
you know, tensions are high.
I mean, God knows in our season,
I mean,
I had lots of frustrations
myself.
Things happen.
Sometimes you just have
to vocalize it.
- All right, kids, we are down
to number one in our countdown.
- Ru, can I say something?
I think it's time I take over.
- Uh, BeBe, you may be
the next drag superstar,
but it's still my show.
- Well, I think the moment
has come for us
to reveal the most unforgettable
fits and fashion
from the runway all worn by you.
- Me?
- You!
- Me?
- Obviously you.
- Oh, my God.
I'm back.
- My favorite
is the very Lacroix one
with the pleats
and the three shades of cream,
beige, and a little lavender.
- I think that looks so pretty.
- That was our Wedding show.
I played the mother
of the bride.
- It's gorgeous.
- Then the red and black.
- Right, now that was very
Miss Ross.
- But it was so beautiful.
That was so striking
and the silhouette
of the body...
- And I love
all the ostrich feathers
on the lilac dress,
the strapless.
- What made some of those
outfits so fantastic
was the fact that you
changed hair color.
- Well, Mathu always wants
to top himself.
I think with
the punk rock outfit,
I think that's probably
the biggest hair
I've ever worn in my career.
Ladies, thank you so much
for stopping by.
I'm so happy
for all of your successes,
and I can't wait till we're all
on the<i> RuPaul Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Tour</i>
all over the world.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
- Thank you
for making it happen.
- You guys make sure
you tune in next week
to see who will be crowned
the next drag queen superstar.
Now, I hope you're hungry...
- [belches]
- Because I've been digging up
some tasty tidbits,
unseen morsels,
and delicious
behind-the-scene nuggets.
[growls]
all: Cherry pie! Cherry pie!
Cherry pie!
- Now naturally, there was
some fierce competition
between the queens.
- It's a competition.
- But what impressed me the most
was the mutual love and support,
because when it comes to drag,
support is essential.
- I'm trying to get this bitch
just to stay on.
I hope I can make
some new drag sisters
to really give me some tips,
help a bitch out.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- We all genuinely want
each other to look good.
- Do you have time, baby,
to help me just put this on?
- People that are
helping each other,
they're helping each other
because they want them to stay.
- And so you just take
your white,
highlight all this area,
and make that pop.
Granted, this is a competition.
It's also a learning experience.
- You, like, want me
to wrap it around you?
- Put--poom, poom, poom, yeah.
This look too bad?
If you are going to win,
you are going to win
no matter what.
That's why if I need
to give you my panties,
I give you my panties,
because if I'm going to win,
I'm going to win
with or without panties.
- Our girls weren't afraid
to talk about anything,
including a drag queen's
best kept secret.
I'm talking about padding.
Are you a padded queen?
- I do pad, yes.
- I wear hip pads, yeah,
but I don't wear a butt pad,
'cause I have
a little bit of a--
- Okay.
- Did you see my ass?
Did you see my hips?
Boys don't have that.
I molded that.
- I think you've got
quite a shape there.
- Well, yesterday,
I wore hip pads.
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,
but if you're trying to do drag,
use your pads to look
at least like a girl.
- Now, you don't have padding.
You're not a padded queen.
- I like being thin.
I like--I modeled myself after,
like, a supermodel.
We're not like that in L.A.
We don't pad.
That's an East Coast, Midwest,
Southern thing
where they're pageant girls.
- It's private,
you know what I mean?
I'm putting on my body.
- This season,
the drag queens proved
that they were talented
celebrity impersonators.
But behind the scenes,
these queens
stepped up their game
and started doing each other.
- Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
- "Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia."
- [laughs]
- [mocking laugh]
- I hot glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.
- "Tyra, can you pass over
that hot glue gun, please?
"I'm fixing to glue
some rhinestones
onto my gown that
I'm trying to fix and make."
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,
but technically,
I'm doing Beyoncé.
- "I love Beyoncé."
- As drag queens,
we make our own families,
but when the girls talked
about their real families,
the emotions ranged
from admiration
to something more complicated.
- "Dear son,
this is your mommy speaking.
"You're a very talented child,
and you could be
whatever you want."
She wrote me a note once before
when I was competing
for something
when I was, like, 20,
and I've kept it.
"So remember, if you don't do
what you're trying to,
I'll be behind you
with my belt."
- So your mom
said she's gon' beat you
if you don't make it?
- Yeah, basically.
- Damn.
- I'm really fortunate,
because a lot of people
don't have that family base,
you know?
Especially in our community.
And I'm just lucky to have a mom
that's so supportive
and I love very much.
- My father's one
of the toughest Scotsmen.
Like, he's a man's man,
you know?
And he was so okay
with me being gay.
He was like, "I love you.
It doesn't really matter
as long as you're happy."
And I was like, "Bizzle."
- To each his own.
- Absolutely.
- Like, when people
find out you're gay
and they're like,
"You know God loves you,"
yeah, I know he does.
Imagine what the world
would look like
if there weren't gay people.
Eww.
- I loved hearing
all the girls' backgrounds.
But Jujubee's sense of history
was positively Shakespearean.
- Did you guys know
the word "drag" is an acronym
that Shakespeare created?
- "Dress resembling a girl."
- It was actually a side note
for his plays,
because back in the day,
the players of the stage
were all men.
- They were ladyboys.
- One thing there was
no shortage of was girl talk.
- Whoo!
- Think it was gay pride
last year or something.
I got a taxi, and we go home.
I was, like, in drag in bed
like, "Come on, baby.
Let's do it."
[chuckles]
And he's like, "No!
You're Sahara!"
- Well, and people ask him,
you know,
if we have sex when I'm in drag
and all that stuff, so...
- There's ever been a night
where you're just messy drunk?
And you're just like,
"I don't want to take this off.
Let's just do it."
- No.
- Now, you know I love
a good catchphrase.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
And don't fuck It up.
But this season,
I had some serious competition.
- Work.
- Work.
- You better work, bitch.
- I'm not a bitch.
I'm America's sweetheart.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Are you going through it?
Are you going through
some psychological changes
in your life?
- I'm not.
- I'm not either.
- Now, I know you're
a two piece and a biscuit.
- As long as that two piece
and a biscuit is there,
I am perfectly happy.
- [laughs]
- I got my two piece
and a biscuit
waiting on me anywhere I go.
- During my worldwide tour,
I stopped in Texas,
and I did meet mystique,
and she wanted to be tipped
with a two piece and a biscuit.
- Two piece and a biscuit.
Mystique gone but not forgotten.
[laughter and applause]
Now, it's been
an incredible season...
What do the bags say?
They say "Santino"?
[laughter]
Dripping with charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another--
Oh, shit.
- And I'm not just talking
about the queens.
I'm talking about the judges.
Sassy Santino
and our resident fashionista,
Merle Ginsberg,
not to mention our star-studded
panel of guest judges.
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.
- [gasps]
- Kathy, did you know Jessica
was padded?
- I am too actually.
- Okay.
- Yeah, I've been padded
for the last ten years.
[laughter]
- The judges brought a lot
of life experience to the show,
and the contestants
were all ears.
- You must not listen
to the interviewer.
If he says,
"Where are you from?"
you say, "Well, actually,
I'm from so-and-so,
but in my book,"
and then you name the book.
You always have to bring it in
yourself,
'cause they're never
gonna bring it in.
- I started working
in a strip club,
like, with the regular girls.
You could walk into the club,
and you could find
that there was one girl
everyone was trying to be like,
and they're all doing
the same thing,
so it doesn't make
financial sense.
- So your lip sync
was very, very good too,
which I noticed right away,
because in films,
that's what we always did.
It's not easy
to lip-synch correctly,
and you did a super job.
- In the real world,
if you get arrested
and don't speak English,
the court
appoints a interpreter.
But here on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
language barriers
are just part of the fun.
Did you tuck your candy?
Did you hide your candy?
- My candy?
- Yes.
Um,<i> como...</i>
-<i> Huevos.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Huevos el pollo?</i>
- Oh, my--this?
- Something with Angela
at the end.
- Everyone has a problem
with my name.
- I was gonna say Kangela.
I'll change mine to Kangela.
- 'Cause a lot of kids
are calling you Shan-gella.
- Or Shanga-linga.
She called her
Shanga-linga.
- I do have an ointment
in my dressing room for that.
Yeah, you know,
a lot of the judges
mentioned Tyra's deep voice.
- When you transform into Tyra,
why doesn't your voice change?
- In fact, Santino
didn't just mention it.
He worked it.
- [in deep voice]
I think that Tyra should stay,
but sometimes when I see her
and she's talking to me,
I just think, "Who is this dude
talking to me?"
- [laughs]
- I'll give you $4,000
to stop that right now.
- Right, right, me too.
Now, most queens aren't shy,
but this is a family show.
So you have to use
a little discretion.
And nothing says discretion
like a double entendre.
- Anybody that's eating
my cherry pie
raves about it.
- How's the crust?
- Crispy
and a little tender
in the middle.
- And the fruit?
- Always ripe.
- Is it juicy, Pandora?
- It's overflowing with juices.
- Would you say your cherry pie
was succulent?
- I would say it's succulent
and a bit moist.
- Oh.
- [laughing]
You getting hungry, Kim?
- I'm getting hungry.
- Now, for some queens,
the ultimate praise is when
people think you're a real girl.
- It's really a woman,
isn't it?
- It is really a woman.
- I knew it.
I knew it.
- It's called being fishy.
- When you walked out,
I really did have
that same moment that Dita had.
Is that a girl?
I think that's a girl.
There's an imposter in the show.
It's a girl.
Check her crotch.
- Well, maybe we have
a real scandal here.
Maybe she's actually
a real woman.
- What?
- Ever thought about that?
- I will walk off this set.
- I will kick her ass.
- I was give her a pap smear
in five seconds,
and I will get
to the bottom of it.
- This season, we not only
dished celebrities.
We ate 'em for lunch.
- I mean, I love everything.
I'm gonna be the Paula tonight,
I think.
I'm the Paula
of the RuPaul show.
- I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls
who would like to take you out
if you ever--
if you're ever available.
[laughter]
- I really like Lady Gaga
a lot.
She's almost like
a drag queen herself.
- Almost?
You're very kind.
You actually did more work than
Britney does in her concert.
I mean, you actually sang
in your concert,
which is something
Britney does not do.
- I like that wig.
It looked good.
You know, I really did see--
Leslie Stahl
has a good wig as well.
Leslie, I'm so sorry.
- At the end of the day,
I hope I'm less of a judge
and more of a teacher.
And the best way to teach,
of course, is by example.
Earlier today, I had my face
lifted for a fifth time.
Why?
Because I'm dedicated to this,
children.
You are a burning sensation,
and I don't want an ointment
to clear it up.
You have to use what you've got
to get what you want.
You know, my friends call me
the MacGyver of drag.
I will take a wire hanger and...
- A Maxi Pad.
- And jimmy-rig
a lighting system
in a hotel room.
- What happens sometimes
is that my nuts pop,
and it reminds me
that I'm a dude.
- [laughs]
- So I try to go right back
to being feminine,
so that's what happens.
- Yeah, I mean, I know--
everybody knows
about popping a cherry,
but nobody talks
about popping a nut.
- No.
- It is part of doing drag.
So in case you missed
any of the fierce action...
- You pushed me!
You pushed me!
- Here's a fast-forward
flashback
of this season's competition.
- Cheeseburger, Taco Bell,
and a Diet Coke on the side,
girl.
- On the first day,
the Gone with the Window
photo shoot
tested the queens' ability
to get real,
to get glamour,
and get blown.
- I've never been blown
like that in my life.
[laughter]
- Then everybody had to channel
their inner Scarlett O'Hara
and style an outfit
from a set of curtains.
Morgan McMichaels,
you are the winner
of this challenge.
Mystique, based on your
unforgettable presentation,
I'm giving you
a "get out of jail free" card.
Sahara Davenport, shante,
you stay.
Shangela, sashay away.
Next, we divided the queens into
two teams of burlesque dancers,
and each team had to work hard
for the money...
[cheers and applause]
Then take to the streets
and represent.
- You got some money for me?
- Does anybody want
cherry pie gift certificates?
- Help me out.
Buy some pie.
- Be soprano, though,
when you talk, girl.
- Hi. Would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
- In the end, Sahara won,
and Raven
and Nicole Paige Brooks
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
you are a fabulous queen.
Now sashay away.
Next, the girls
had to shoot a commercial
for Disco Extra
Greasy Shortening.
- Hi.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
- Wait, can you stop?
Can we cut?
Can you--
is it home-fried male?
- Is it home-fried male?
- Home-fried meal.
- Meal. okay.
Thought she was
gonna fry up a boy.
- On the main stage,
the girls turned it out
in front of country legend
Tanya Tucker.
- Wow.
Awesome.
- Tyra stepped up her game
with three outfits in one.
Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
Miss Thing.
And it was Mystique's turn
to, well, split.
[laughter and applause]
- Next, we asked the girls
to channel
their best celebrity
impersonations
for a little quiz show
we call<i> The Snatch Game.</i>
- I'm so--
I'm a little embarrassed, Ru.
- Are you embarrassed?
- I'm a little embarrassed.
'Cause I just wrote, "I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts."
[laughter]
- Britney,
Dumb Dee Dee's so dumb,
last night, she got arrested
for driving without a...
- A baby in her lap.
- A baby...
[laughter]
Tatiana took the prize,
and Sonique bent over backwards
to try and stay in the game...
when she and Morgan
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
This choice
has never been so difficult.
Sonique...
sashay away.
For the next challenge,
we asked the girls
to customize wedding dresses.
And Tyra's "singing"
and her hot glue gun
got on everybody's nerves.
- [off-key singing]
Ah, shh...
- Keep burning yourself,
bitch.
- Ah!
- But on the main stage,
the judges went all
Lady Gaga over Tyra's look.
- You look like
a porcelain doll...
- Thank you.
- With the makeup, I love it.
- Tyra Sanchez,
congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
When it came time
to lip-synch for your life,
Sahara was really
on her toes.
And poor Morgan
got left at the altar.
-<i> ♪ When the valley is deep ♪</i>
<i>♪ I said I'll never ♪</i>
- For the next challenge,
the guest judge Henry Rollins
joined Terri Nunn,
and the whole house was rockin'.
- Ah!
-<i> ♪ Uno, dos, tres, quatro ♪</i>
-<i> ♪ T ♪</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
all:<i> ♪ A, T, I ♪</i>
<i>♪ T, A, T, I ♪</i>
- You know what,
Eddie Murphy?
- Ah!
- You cannot have this,
ladygirl, honey.
- Jessica won,
so Jujubee and Sahara
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
-<i> ♪ Black velvet ♪</i>
<i>♪ If you please ♪</i>
[sultry music]
- Sahara Davenport...
sashay away.
When the girls regroup,
they hit the books to create
their own autobiography.
- It's so exciting to be a part
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's almost as exciting
as my new book<i> Out of the Box.</i>
- The book is called
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
- I just got finished
writing a memoir,
and I call it
<i>Memoirs of a Gay-sha.</i>
- I have my new book.
- What was that?
- The name is<i> Jessica Wild:</i>
<i>The dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
My new book is going
to hit stores soon.
- In the end, Raven was
the hands-down best seller.
Raven, you're young, broke,
and fabulous.
Tatiana and Jessica Wild had
to lip-synch for their lives.
And it was the closing chapter
for Jessica.
- Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.
- So the next challenge
had the girls working
with some gay pioneers
from the Stonewall era.
- Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?
- Whoa, Jesus.
- I thought maybe you'd do
something interesting with it,
like a low cut.
I put in all this stuff
for today.
- And these silver foxes
turned into golden girls.
- Oh, dear.
[laughing]
- And in the end, Raven
carried herself to victory.
Yay!
[applause]
Pandora, you opened your box
for the world to see.
Now sashay away.
[laughing and applause]
Next, the girls were nominated
for the first annual Diva Award.
[women vocalizing]
♪ ♪
all: Bitch.
- On the main stage,
the girls served
some serious mean teen fashions,
dished up some extreme D.C.
executive realness,
and gave Hollywood's
red carpet beauties
a run for their money.
- I feel wonderful, fabulous,
gorgeous, beautiful.
- Gorgeous.
- In the end, Tyra outdiva-ed
the other divas.
Tatianna, you made
this competition fun and fresh.
For that,
I have just two words.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
And then there were three.
all: Amen.
- In just one week,
Raven, Tyra, or Jujubee
will walk away with the title
of America's
next drag superstar.
The winner will also receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and be the face
of nyxcosmetics.com,
an exclusive
one-year PR contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity,
be featured in l.a.Eyeworks'
legendary
designer eyewear campaign,
and headline
Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks,
and a cash prize of $25,000.
If you think
you know these divas,
think again.
Because behind
the fabulous dances
and fierce facades,
there's a whole lot of heart
and soul
you've never seen until now.
When first we saw Jujubee's
audition tape...
- Hi,<i> RuPaul Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my name is Airline.
- We were wowed
by her transformation.
[gasps]
Jujubee.
- And do you have anything
you want to say
to your fans out there?
- I just want to say thank you
for all the years that
you have been supporting me.
- Sweet and bubbly
to feisty and fierce.
- And you!
Legendary you think you are.
Legendary
looks like leg and dairy.
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Jujubee wasn't afraid
to share some of the pain
from her past.
Where do you get your sense
of humor from?
- My father passing away
when I was 15.
- 15?
- Yeah, and from then on,
it was just, like,
you know, I can't be stuck
in this little ball.
- Right.
- And I can't, you know,
cry about it anymore.
He was like my king.
He did everything for me,
he taught me everything I knew,
he knew that I was gay
before I knew I was gay.
He dragged me to school
every morning,
and the last thing
he would always say
before I left the car was,
"And don't let those kids
tell you anything different."
He's like, "I know
what they say about you.
You can do
whatever you want to do."
And--and that's what I'm doing.
- But Jujubee's
positive attitude
is positively infectious.
- I have the full package.
I have personality,
I have sense of style,
and I have great big,
white teeth.
- I thought she was dynamite.
She had a fantastic personality.
- I'm already happy
about just being here.
But if I win,
everybody gets a puppy.
- Our next finalist
is the other Tyra--
the beautiful, the gorgeous,
the alluring Tyra Sanchez.
- During my transformation,
when I start feeling like Tyra,
it's backstage,
putting on the makeup.
But it all comes into place
when I hear them say...
- Tyra Sanchez.
- Hear that crowd screaming.
And then once that music starts,
my heart stops for probably,
like, a split second.
And it starts beating again,
but it's not my heart
at that point.
It's Tyra's heart
that's beating.
- Tyra.
Ah.
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.
- It's very Rita Hayworth.
<i>Gilda.</i>
- Yes,<i> Gilda.</i>
- Tyra had to overcome a lot
to achieve what she had.
- I grew up in probably, like,
every project in Orlando.
Like, at the end
of every school year
someone got shot or murdered.
- And in real life,
this hot drag mama
is a young dad.
- I do have a son.
- Jeremiah.
Oh, that's the tattoo you have.
- Yeah.
My son makes me smile
every time I see him.
My son is my motivation
to keep going,
to make his life better.
- You know a family that
drags together stays together.
I would love to be
America's next drag superstar
to, like, inspire more people
to, like, let them know
that they can do it too.
- Raven is a Southern California
girl down to her roots.
- You guys need look no longer,
because the best queens
are in Southern California.
- Raven!
Oh, darling!
- I love doing drag
because I love
the transformation.
I love being able to transform
from a guy into a girl
and then at the end of the night
being able to take it off.
- Raven!
- I definitely do not want
to be a girl.
I love myself, who I am.
It is an art form.
- Now, Raven
landed in the bottom two
early in the competition...
Raven...
I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.
But proved she had the stuff
to make it to the final three.
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm<i> </i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
If I were to win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it will help to show people
that drag's cool,
'cause it's fucking cool.
Drag's cool.
- Well, there you have it,
the fabulous final three.
And if you've been groovin'
to any of my songs this season,
you can find them all

to find out who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
But most importantly,
remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
buy my album and my book?
All right,
now let the music play.

- Previously on
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
- The weakest person
in the group is Tatianna.
- No.
- My mom sent me
to a military school
in hopes that she would
get a little soldier.
Needless to say,
she got a drag queen.
- I think I could sell ice
to an Eskimo.
But not dressed as a fucking
Chicken.
Cock-a-doodle do!
- Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
miss thing.
Congratulations.
You're the winner of this
challenge.
Raven, I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.
You've been down this road
twice...
but you keep pulling through.
Shante.
You stay.
- Thank you.
- Mystique, sashay away.
[laughs and applauds]
And tonight...
hey, squirrel-friends.
Tempers flare...
- I almost just jumped out
this chair at your ass.
- You don't know Beyoncé
personally.
- Are you talking to me?
- And you'll be seeing double.
Rupaul!
Hey, Rupaul!
- Oh, hello, darling.

- Oh, Mystique.
- Wow.
Her lipstick is chunky.
- Is that cake icing
or lipstick?
- No, if it was cake icing,
she would have eaten it off.
- Oh, that's cruel.
- Bye-bye, shablam.
- When Raven
wiped the mirror off,
it was almost like
a cleansing for the room.
Like, a new day.
- I don't know,
I feel bad for her.
- Well, we knew from day one
that she was going home soon.
Shit rolls downhill.
- Sonique, she always got that
stink face.
And if she is talking,
it's usually
she's talking mad shit
about people.
- You know, karma is a bitch,
and I think you just get what
you give.
- I just don't feel like she was
this big, horrible thing
that everyone, you know,
has the right
to talk such shit about.
- I pity her.
I don't feel bad for her at all.
- I don't think she needs to be
pitied though.
"She doesn't need your
pity, bitch."
I pity you for the face
that you have.
- I just don't want to have to
lip-sync for my life again.
I don't.
- You better work, bitch.
- I don't want to.
I'm gonna be devastated
if I have to lip-sync
for my life again.
Two weeks on the bottom
is not good.
I won't do it again.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
- You got she-mail.
Good morning, racers.
Sincerity is everything.
And if you can fake that,
you got it made.
Play the game right and you're
gonna leave here
with a whole lot more
than a trash compactor
and a lifetime supply
of turtle wax.
You could snatch the title of
America's next drag superstar.
And please remember to always
spay and neuter your pets.
[laughs]
- You know, there's so many
things that I don't know.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[applause]
Attention, drag race shoppers.
The pit crew and I just got back
from stimulating the economy.
Because for today's
mini challenge,
we're gonna play...
♪ The Queen is Right ♪
In this game,
you'll have to guess
the correct prices of some
drag queen essentials.
There's gonna be three rounds,
and the winner of each round
will advance
to Rupaul's showcase throwdown.
Now since you've been here,
none of you have been able
to contact anyone
from the outside,
but that's about to change.
The big winner of the final
showcase throwdown
will get the chance
to phone home.
- The first thing that pops
into my mind is,
"I'm going to call Chris."
My boyfriend, you know?
I miss him so much.
- All right, ladies.
Are you ready to play
The Queen is Right?
[cheers and applause]
Raven!
- Whoo!
- Swish on down, mommy.
Jujubee!
[laughter]
Sahara Davenport!
[cheering and laughter]
Okay.
Are you queens ready?
- Yes!
- Our first item,
a six-pack of tube socks.
Who needs surgery when you can
stuff your way from flat
to double D?
Raven, what is your guess?
- $9.45.
- Jujubee, what is your guess?
- $5.98.
- Sahara's writing down
her price.
Sahara is guessing--
- $6.00.
- Now, Sahara,
you cock-blocked Jujubee.
- Yes, she did.
- The correct price is...
$10.99.
- Yay, yeah!
- Congratulations, Raven.
- I won something!
- The Queen is Right!
- Winning that made me
feel great.
Like, okay, these bitches
better watch out.
- Our next item...
hemorrhoid cream.
A best-kept beauty secret
to decrease under-eye puffiness
for any queen recovering
from a hard day's night.
Pandora Boxx,
how much do you believe
this hemorrhoid cream
is worth?
- Rupaul, I'm gonna go with
$2.98.
- Jessica Wild?
- It's a cream that I don't
know for what it is.
$4.50.
- Morgan McMichaels?
- $5.85.
- The correct price is...
$5.59.
Congratulations, Jessica Wild.
The Queen is Right!
[applause]
- If I have the opportunity,
I am going to call my mom,
because more than just a mom,
she's my best friend.
- Our next item...
a roll of duct tape.
Not only used for tucking
your tender parts,
but also an essential
for any aspiring
MacGyver of drags.
Tyra, what's your guess?
- $2.98.
- Al right, Sonique?
- I'm gonna say $4.00.
- All right, Tatianna?
- $3.75.
- The correct price is...
$6.98.
Sonique is the winner!
Congratulations, Sonique.
The Queen is Right!
[applause]
- Sonique ended up winning.
Boo.
- All right, ladies,
here we go.
Our showcase throwdown
is designed
for a lady-boy night
on the town.
Starting with a pair of genuine
brass knuckles.
Now what lady-boy
night on the town
would be complete without
a can of...
♪ Pepper spray ♪
With its own cute little
carrying case.
Perfect for the drag queen
on the go.
And finally, a brand-new wig!
And not just any wig,
but a lace front wig
made of real human hair
courtesy of Wig Pro Collections.
Now you need to bid
what you think
all three of these items cost.
Whoever comes closest
without going over
will win the total package.
Let's start with Sonique.
- $225.01.
- Jessica?
- $390.
- Raven, it's come down to you.
- I'm going with $395.
- The correct price is...
$1,283.90.
Raven, you are the winner!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
- Raven, you get
the whole package
and a phone call home to mama.
- Yes!
I'm excited to get to call
my mom.
I don't need the wig.
I don't need the pepper spray.
But calling my mom is golden
to me.
- It's time for your
main challenge.
This week, you'll be guest stars
on a game show
I like to call
Snatch Game.
And in the great tradition
of drag,
you'll be asked to appear
doing your best
celebrity impersonations.
- Wow.
That is fierce.
- You'll be judged on your
look, precision, and wit.
And it really helps if you can
make us laugh.
So, gentlemen, start your
engines
and may the best
Liza, terrific win.
[laughs]
[applause]
[phone trilling]
- Hello?
- Mom?
My biggest inspiration for drag
is my mom.
Mom.
- [indistinct]
- Mother?
- Hello?
- Hello, mom.
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?
My mother is the most perfect
person in the world.
And how's church?
- It's fantastic.
Been praying for you every
night, so--
and every day.
- I love you.
Give my love to everyone.
- I will.
Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.
Being able to talk to her,
it brought me to a place
where I feel confident again.
Mom can always do that.
- So who does everybody think
they're going to impersonate?
Who?
- Who do you--
- I'm doing Beyoncé, so...
- I'm gonna be Bey.
Beyonce is sort of just like me.
Well, I basically have my look
together, I think.
- They didn't give us much time
for this one.
- I know, right?
- I actually have never
impersonated a celebrity before.
So, Jessica...
- Yes?
- Who do you usually, um, do?
- I always perform as myself,
you know, Jessica Wild.
- Same with me.
I just do Tatianna.
Tatianna is the character.
I was like,
"What am I going to do?"
- Our main challenge is the
Snatch Game,
and Rupaul told us to dress up
like our
celebrity impersonations
and get ready to
make people laugh.
Sonique, what made you decide
to do Gaga instead of Madonna?
- I don't have a madonna.
- You look like her.
You could borrow
from every girl.
I guarantee you would
find something.
- My first choice, of course,
would be Pink.
- I'm doing Pink.
Pink is my number one character.
I love her, and I do
a really good, you know,
illusion of it.
- I mean, I love Pink,
but I don't need to do her
every time I go on stage.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.
- I did not hear
a word you said.
- I base Sonique off of Pink.
That whole rocker kind of image.
I just--I really like Lady Gaga,
and I want to go for that.
- You better work it out, girl.
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hi.
- Hey, squirrel-friends.
- Hello.
- Got a nut for another
squirrel-friend?
- There's plenty of nuts to go
around, babe.
- [chuckles]
I bet.
So, Morgan, who are you?
Who have you chosen as your
celebrity impersonation?
- I have chosen Pink
as my celebrity.
She's, like,
the number one for me.
- How would you describe
Pink's personality?
- She stands up
for good things.
Like, she uses her celebrity
for, you know,
PETA and against
animal cruelty
and things like that,
so, you know?
- Well, PETA's sort of a tough
joke to sell in Snatch Game.
- But she's funny.
- I trust you have a plan.
Sonique-ka-nika-nika-nika.
Who are you doing?
- I want to do Lady Gaga.
- Lady Gaga?
- I love her.
- You know, I was on the fence
about her
until she did that
interview where they said,
"What are you looking for
in a boyfriend?"
and she said...
"A big cock."
- [chuckles]
It'll be really easy for me
to channel Lady Gaga
'cause I'll say
what's on my mind
and hopefully
it'll make you laugh.
- [chuckles]
All right, Sonique.
I expect to be gagging
on your Gaga.
Tatianna, now,
who are you gonna be?
- I think I'm doing Britney.
- ♪ Britney ♪
- Britney Spears.
- What does Britney do?
- [smacks gum]
- Chew gum?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ahh.
She does this thing with her--
she'll go...like that,
which is really--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it! That's it!
Are we gonna see that?
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.
- And some hair flips?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I want to know who left
my hair out here?
- Me.
I'm gonna be the supermodel
of the world Rupaul.
- [laughs]
You little thief.
Eve Harrington.
Trying to steal my show,
are you?
- [laughs]
- What are some of the
signature Rupaul things?
- You open your eyes like this.
- That's usually a sign
that I have gas, actually.
Now some people would say it's
kind of risky
to do an impersonation
of a person
who's gonna be in the room
with you.
- Yes.
I know, but I can say,
"I did Rupaul
in front of Rupaul."
And you're going to have a lot
of fun
looking that Latina
making you.
- All right, go back to work.
- Yeah, you better work, bitch.
- Pandora Boxx.
Come over here, girl.
I wanna talk to you.
- Okay.
I'm gonna be Carol Channing.
- Carol Channing?
- Carol Channing.
- [dramatic gasp]
Yay!
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you!
"Corn?
I don't remember eating corn."
- [laughing]
- Are you doing<i> Hello, Dolly!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Carol?
Are you doing<i> Love Boat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Carol?</i>
Are you doing "raspberries!"?
- I think I'm doing kind of
like the raspberries era,
because I don't have the big,
crazy glasses.
So, you know,
you can't do, like,
modern Carol without those huge,
like--
- Right.
- Like, saucer glasses.
- Yes.
Thank you, miss channing.
- Thank you.
- Look how gorgeous!
My goodness, the blending.
- Yes, girl.
- It's severe up in here.
Who are you doing?
- I'm gonna do Paris Hilton.
- Why'd you choose her?
- She's fun to make fun of.
- Yes.
Now you've been up for
elimination twice.
- I'm over it.
- You are over it.
- I don't wanna do it again.
- So you're putting
all your eggs
in Paris Hilton's big basket.
- Yes.
I'm trying.
We'll see what happens.
- All right.
Good luck, Paris.
- Thank you.
- All right, I'm gonna scoot
around over here.
Ooh, how "purdy".
And who are you doing today?
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,
but technically
I'm doing Beyoncé.
- Now, Santino mentioned
the other day
that you should
work on your voice.
- When he said it, I thought
that maybe--
maybe he's right.
If it's a beautiful person,
it should be, like,
a beautiful voice with it.
- Listen, you know, your voice
worked
for Bea Arthur
and Weezy Jefferson.
All right, Tyra.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Hi, mommy.
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.
- Good, good, good.
- Who are you impersonating?
- Whitney Houston.
- Whitney!
Now, are you gonna be<i> Being</i>
<i>Bobby Brown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Whitney Houston,</i>
or are you gonna be Clive Davis'
Whitney Houston?
- I think<i> Being Bobby Brown's</i>
Whitney is a little more fun.
- [laughing]
Bobby Christina!
- Bobby!
- [laughing]
- Well, I'm so glad that
Whitney's back,
and she's on our show.
- [laughing]
Word, so am i.
- Hey, Jujubee.
- Hi, momma.
- Are you preparing for your
Snatch Game?
- Yes, I am.
- Who are you impersonating?
- Kimora Lee.
- You're doing Kimora Lee?
What is she like?
- She's a business woman,
she's a supermodel,
she's a mommy.
So she's kind of like
a chameleon.
- Where do you get your
sense of humor from?
- My father passing away.
You never know when somebody's
gonna leave you.
So you treat every day
like it's your last day.
Amd you just give the best that
you can give, you know?
- And that's why
the sense of humor?
- Yeah, of course.
Why not?
- All right,
you get back to work.
I can't wait to see your
Kimora Lee.
- I can't wait either, girl.
- [laughing]
All right, ladies, the Snatch
Game is about to begin.
Now, this is your opportunity
to steal the spotlight.
Ham it up and make us laugh.
Now the queen with the best
celebrity charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent will win
the challenge.
Oh, and one other thing...
don't fuck it up.
All right, I'll see you all
later, good luck.
all: Bye.
- Bye.
What do I need to do first?
I need to tuck my hoo-hoo away.
I decided I was going to emulate
Britney Spears,
but I had no
idea what I was going to wear.
- What wig are you wearing?
- That one.
Blonde wavy, and then I'm gonna
put a fedora on top of it.
- The wig she was wearing was
just, like, three hairs.
- I have a better blonde wig
if you wanna use it.
It's just fuller.
- It's fuller?
- Yeah.
- Whatever works, definitely.
Thank you.
Morgan, surprisingly enough,
let me borrow one of her wigs.
Is this what you use
for your Britney?
- No, I left my Britney wig
at home.
- I think it might've come
from the fact
that she didn't think
I was going to be a threat.
So might as well let her--
you know, throw her a bone.
Yeah?
Cool.
I think Morgan needs to be
knocked off her high horse,
and I think that that will
happen with this challenge.
Yay!
[laughing]
[applause]
- Hello, everybody!
Welcome to an all-star edition
of Snatch Game 2010.
I'm your host Rupaul.
Let's get to know our
contestants.
She's an actress, model,
and a red carpet favorite.
Phoebe Price is here.
Hello, Phoebe.
- Thank you.
Thank you for having me.
- He's a talented actor,
comedian, and housewife.
Welcome<i> Ugly Betty's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Alec Mapa.</i>
Hey, Alec.
- Hi, Ru.
This is a master class in
staying in character.
When you see a really good
queen do it,
you realize that
the clothing and the wig
is the last thing
that has anything to do
with bringing forth
the essence of this person.
- Let's say hello to our
fabulous celebrity panel.
First up, Carol Channing
is here.
- It's great to be here,
wherever I am.
- [laughing]
- All right, next up
we have Pink.
Hey, Pink.
- Rock and roll, baby.
- Now, I've never seen you on
a game show before.
Is this your first one?
- This is my first--well,
it's not my first one,
but it's my
first game show.
- Kimora Lee Simmons.
Now I know that you're not
Simmons anymore.
- We don't wanna talk
about that.
- You don't wanna talk
about that.
- It's personal.
- Up next we have Lady Gaga.
Look at your poker face,
darling.
- Trust.
- We have Rupaul.
Hey, Rupaul, how are you?
Rupaul?
Miss Rupaul?
- Oh, hello, darling!
- [laughing]
- How are you?
[laughing]
How are you?
I said I'm going to do Rupaul.
And I'm going to have fun,
and I hope Rupaul will have fun
with my character, too.
- Oh, boy, you look gorgeous.
- Rupaul is very professional
when she's in drag.
Rupaul doesn't just get up
and start walking
and running and singing.
- All right, Paris Hilton
is here.
You have a line of clothing,
you have perfumes,
you have shoes.
- I didn't know that I had
shoes out there.
- Yes, you do.
She's made a big comeback,
Whitney Houston is here.
- I'm so excited to be with all
these lovely divas.
Yes, ma'am.
But let's not forget,
I am the original diva.
- Yes, you are.
Give her a big round
of applause.
- Thank you.
I love you much.
I love you much.
- Whitney's back.
- Ha!
- All right, next to Whitney,
of course...
Britney Spears is here!
- Hey, y'all.
- So happy to have you
on the show.
What's your favorite game?
- Oh, goodness, I like playing
hide the cucumber.
I love that one.
- Oh, yes, one of my
favorites too.
- I always win.
- Next to Britney,
we have Sasha Fierce,
a.k.a. Beyoncé
is in the house.
Hey, Sasha.
- Hi, how are you?
Beyonce's just like me.
All I have to do is
just be myself,
like, just smile,
say nice things--
thank you for having me.
- Tyra is really lucky that she
has immunity this week.
Because her Beyoncé
was not Beyoncé.
It was Tyra talking.
- Here's how the game works.
I'll ask a series of questions,
the celebrities will fill in
the blanks,
and you'll give an answer that
you think will match theirs.
All right, Phoebe,
are you ready to play?
- I'm ready.
- Okay, here we go.
Fat Fanny, the drag queen
is so fat
instead of dollars she prefers
to be tipped with blank.
- Well, I know in the South it
would be pork rinds.
So I would have to say
pork rinds.
- Pork rinds,
that's a good answer.
- She wants to be tipped with
pork rinds.
She's fat, right?
Carol Channing?
- Bingo.
[laughing]
Did I win?
- No, you didn't win.
Actually, we may want to see
your answer.
What did you fill in
the blank with?
Well, I said turkey legs.
- Turkey legs!
She's close.
Pink, what'd you say?
- Well, you know, like, I went
to Britney's concert,
and it's just, like, you know,
a drag show.
So I--and I tipped her
with slices of lunchmeat.
- Slices of lunchmeat.
Good answer.
- Paris Hilton,
you have pork rinds?
- No, I don't know too many
fat people.
- Oh, okay,I see.
- So I don't know what they
like to eat or be tipped with,
but I would think that
they would want something
that could fit
in their tight clothing...
- Yes, of course.
- And that they could eat.
So I put beef jerky.
- Beef jerky.
- When I was fat...
- Yeah?
- Kevin liked to tip me in
what he liked to call
his man butter.
- Man butter!
- Mm-hmm, it was really good.
- Sasha Fierce, what do you have
for Fat Fanny,
the drag queen?
What'd she like to be
tipped with?
- Well, ru, I never met
Fat Fanny,
but during my worldwide tour
I stopped in Texas,
and I did meet Mystique.
- Uh-huh.
- And she wanted to be tipped
with a two-piece and a biscuit.
- Two-piece and a biscuit.
Mystique gone but not forgotten.
[cheers and applause]
Okay, you ready for
the next question, Alec?
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.
Slutty Sally is so slutty,
last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got blank.
- I'm gonna cast a wide net here
and say the last time I
took a ride on her disco stick,
I got an STD.
- What do you think Slutty
Sally gave to people
with her disco stick?
- Scurvy.
- Scurvy.
Scurvy, yeah.
- I'm the national spokesperson
for Broadway Actresses
Against Scurvy.
- [laughing]
- We deliver limes and lemons
to all the people around
in the neighborhood.
And raspberries.
- And raspberries.
Is that a deterrent for scurvy,
raspberries?
- Well, they tell me it is.
I don't really know anything
except what they tell me,
you know.
Carol Channing,
hysterically funny.
I love that she was completely
out of it the entire time.
- Let's go to Kimora Lee
and see what she says.
- Scabies.
- Scabies is not sexually
transmitted, is it?
- It can be, I've had it.
- [laughing]
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.
- Yes.
- Last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got...
- Money, honey.
- Lady Gaga, I didn't really
feel like
there was any
characteristic "Gaga-ish-ness".
- Okay, Rupaul--is Rupaul
asleep down there?
Is she okay?
Do we--seriously, is she okay--
oh, she's okay.
- The time has come now for you
to lip-sync for your life!
- [laughing]
- To impersonate somebody
who's standing
ten feet from you
takes gigantic balls.
- ♪ I will always love ♪
♪ Shoes! ♪
- She got shoes
from the disco stick.
From Whitney to Britney.
Slutty Sally is so slutty,
last time I took a ride on her
disco stick, I got...
- I got lost.
- You got lost?
- I got lost.
[laughing]
Am I wrong?
- Britney...
eerily accurate.
Kinda spooky.
- Thank you.
- All right, darling.
Dumb deedee is so dumb,
last night she got arrested
for driving without a blank.
- Let's go to Phoebe price
here, Phoebe price?
- I would have to say driving
without a car.
- Driving without a car.
- I've done that before.
- Where did you go?
- I don't even--
I was just driving around,
and then I realized, like,
I'm walking, y'all.
[laughter]
I'm walking.
- When one queen gets laughs,
everybody scrambles to get just
as many laughs,
but I think once
the scrambling began,
they lost the plot of the game.
- I'm a little embarrassed, Ru.
- Are you embarrassed?
- I'm a little embarrassed,
'cause I just wrote,
"I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts".
[laughing]
- Great minds think alike.
I said car.
- Thank you, girl!
- I broke you in, girl.
I broke you in.
- She looked like Pink,
and the clothes and the wig
and the makeup were hooked up,
but the mannerisms
weren't there for me.
- Wonderful, okay.
Lady Gaga.
Well, my first answer
was spaceship.
- Uh-huh.
- But the one I put down
was car.
- Two points!
Paris Hilton.
- Well, because you're so hot,
I knew that we would get this
right so I said car, too.
- Car!
[applause]
Wonderful!
- The voice wasn't even close
to being Paris Hilton.
- Britney, Dumb Deedee's so
dumb last night she got arrested
for driving without a...
- A baby in her lap.
- A baby...
[laughing]
- Because every time I do it,
I don't get arrested.
- Yes, that's right.
- Dumb.
- Before I say my answer,
can I say one thing?
- Yes.
- To Britney and Whitney.
- Yes.
- Because I love them much.
Whitney, you're such an
inspiration to me.
- I love you too, baby girl.
- But I notice
they keep twitching.
And I know that they're
survivors,
but the only way
they're gonna keep survivin'
if they stop sniffin'
these markers next to them.
- Am I the only one
who's doin' it?
- Uh, I--apparently.
- It smells like home.
[laughing]
- So right now, the score
stands at five for Alec,
three for Phoebe.
Alec has won this game.
- Thanks, stars!
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
- All right, until then
we love you,
keep coming back
on Snatch Game 2010.
All right, stars,
see you next time.
- I'll be really surprised
to see
who's in the bottom two
tomorrow.
Yeah, it'll be
a sleepless night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning,
morning glories.
- It's lip-sync day.
- Here goes.
- Who feel like they're gonna
be on the bottom tonight?
- Just as long as it's not me.
- The bottom is not bad.
[laughing]
- I do wish all of you luck.
Can you win a challenge
two weeks in a row?
- Do you think you're gonna win
two weeks in a row?
- I'm praying I do.
- I don't know why Tyra
was asking
if anyone's ever won
two challenges in a row.
Because she's totally
not gonna win.
- What did you guys think
about me?
- Picking Beyoncé's
a difficult thing to pick.
Like, because she's not
that funny.
- But I don't think Britney
is funny,
but you made her funny.
- No, Britney is funny.
- But there are a lot of things
that B does
that are funny to me.
- The only thing she's done
funny is fall.
- Well, that's funny to you
and that's crude.
And like, I almost just jumped
out this chair at your ass.
That was insulting to Beyoncé.
This is something that she may
have been embarrassed about.
- You gotta get over this whole
Beyoncé thing.
- No, just drop it, please
just drop it, girl.
- Beyoncé fell,
and it was funny.
It tickled me pink.
- I thought it was funny, too.
- It was funny!
You don't know Beyoncé
personally.
- Tyra, she believes
that she's Beyoncé.
And she doesn't wanna hurt
Beyoncé's feelings,
because somehow Beyoncé
pays her bills.
- Well, we'll see
on the main stage.
I'm just gonna shut up.

- I am so jealous.

- [laughing]

- Lisa Rinna.
- Hello.
- You are gorgeous.
- Oh, no, you are.
Stop it. Thank you.
- This week, the ladies
were challenged
to a celebrity impersonation.
Tonight, I asked them
to knock us out
with their own
personal style.
Judges, are you ready
for what's coming?
- Ready!
- Oh, yeah.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Pandora Boxx...
- I'm feeling really good
about the choice I made
with the dress.
I'm listening to what
all the judges have said,
and I'm trying to incorporate
that into my runway.
- She's like
a hollywood starlet
looking for a casting couch.
Tyra sanchez,
ladies and gentlemen.
It's the other Tyra.
- What recession?
[laughter]
- The concept of my costume,
I was thinking,
for a rich, couture woman,
and she has endless
amounts of money.
- Just buried the husband.
- And out spending his money.
- What do the bags say?
They say "Santino."
[laughter]
Oh, my god.
Santino, I didn't know you had
a boutique.
Okay, Morgan McMichaels.
Oh, honey, the circus
is in town.
- My personal style
is funky and fun,
and, you know,
drag is a circus,
and I want to be the director.
- It's the greatest show
on earth, Morgan McMichaels.
Jujubee.
Or should I say Lil' Kim?
- I feel like I'm
a superhero diva,
and my power is glitter.
- Is that Lil' Kim
or Lil' Kimchi?
Yes.
- Wow.
- Oh.
Sonique's in the house,
ladies and gentlemen.
Julie Newmar,
eat your heart out.
- My style was dominatrix,
feline, sex kitten.
- Faster pussycat, kill, kill.
Tatianna Porizkova.
- As I'm walking further down
the runway,
I'm noticing that my skirt
is rising and rising
and rising.
- Honey, if that skirt
were any shorter,
we'd have to arrest you
for dealing crack.
Jessica Wild.
Puerto Rico, okay.
- I feel great.
I feel very good.
I'm very happy with my outfit.
- She gonna party like
it's 1999, hunty.
High fashion.
Parisian.
- Ohh.
- Don't go out and blend in
with the rest of them.
Every time you go out there,
look your best.
Don't save something for later
because you may not have later.
- Ooh, yes, honey.
- These ruffles have not
any ridges.
- No, I bet you can't take
just one bite.
Ooh, girl!
Sahara Davenport.
What will people say?
- I'm feeling very powerful
and strong.
They need to see
this side of me.
- Little Grace Jones.
- Yes, gorgeous.
Ladies, your fate
is in your hands.
Inside there's either
a heel or no heel.
If it's a heel,
you can walk away safe.
No heel, and you stay,
which means you're one of
the best or worst of the week.
Tyra Sanchez, heel or no heel?
She's got a heel.
Congratulations, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join Sasha Fierce
backstage with the dancers.
Tatianna.
No heel.
You stay.
Raven.
- Please just let there be
a fucking heel in this briefcase
so I can leave the stage.
- Heel.
- Yes! Thank you, Jesus!
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
No heel.
Jessica Wild.
Heel.
Sahara Davenport.
Heel.
Sonique.
No heel.
Pandora Boxx.
No heel.
Morgan McMichaels.
No heel.
You stay.
The five of you represent
the top and bottom of the week.
It's time for
the judges' critique.
Jujubee, the challenge
yesterday, you were Kimora Lee.
- I think I would have liked to
have seen you to be even bigger.
- We don't want to
talk about that.
- You don't want to talk
about that?
- It's personal.
- When you do characters,
and you only have
a short amount of time,
you want to do the biggest thing
about them
that makes people go,
"That's Kimora."
- Thank you, Jujubee.
Sonique, yesterday you portrayed
Lady Gaga.
- I think what Lady Gaga
was missing was comedy.
- Trust.
I didn't want to embarrass
my character.
It's all about the fashion.
I focused a lot
on the way I looked.
- I want you to come out
from behind the mask.
I feel like you might be hiding
a little bit.
- Would you like me
to take my mask off?
- Would you, please?
Can we see?
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Sonique.
- There we go, okay.
- Yay!
- There's a lot of fabulousness
in there,
and I think we just need to see
more of it.
- All right, Sonique,
thank you.
Pandora Boxx.
- Hello.
- I think you give great camp,
because instead of doing camp
that's, like, cheesy,
you do camp that's funny.
- I just wrote "I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts."
[laughter]
- I think you nailed it.
You so nailed it, girl.
I just think you own it.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna.
How do you think you did on
the Snatch Game?
- I felt really proud
of myself.
- Last time I took a ride
on her disco stick, I got...
- I got lost.
- She used to live around
the corner from us,
and so I saw her a lot,
and you nailed her.
- I think you've got
a million-dollar face
and a $5 million body,
and you've got a $20 outfit on.
But I want to see more charm
and less hooker.
- Morgan McMichaels.
Tell me about your Pink
during snatch game.
Now, I've never seen you
on a game show before.
Is this your first one?
- This is my first--
it's not my first one,
but it's my first
game show.
- Your Pink,
I didn't necessarily get.
I think you could have been
way more obvious,
way more butch.
- It wasn't very effervescent.
- I felt like it went over
like a fart in a space suit.
And it was a risk.
And I knew by doing Pink,
I would be here.
- Thank you, ladies.
While you wait in the
Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
This is the time when we have
to break this shit down.
Sonique, I was not gagging over
her Lady Gaga.
- Yeah.
- Even if we don't know
who Lady Gaga is.
She could have done anything.
Make something up.
- Great on the pole dancing.
Like, unbelievable.
- When she hit the pole,
she was on fire.
She has to take that
pole performance
and put it in her
Lady Gaga.
She has to be more out there.
Tatianna.
- She needs to go home
and read 20<i> Vogues</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and get back to us.
- Her Britney was amazing.
- Oh, the Britney, genius.
Her Britney blew me away.
I think it was
the best character
on the Snatch panel.
- Pandora Boxx.
- Pandora Boxx has got
great comedic timing.
I don't love her personal style.
I mean, it's almost easier
for her
to play a character than
be herself as Pandora Boxx.
It's not all, like, linking up.
- She's a drag queen
for Christ's sake.
She giving us lightness
and comedy and old movie star,
and I think she does it
really well.
- Okay.
Morgan McMichaels.
Her Pink impersonation was not
very strong.
- She did say that she knew
that she may have that problem
with not being able to go for it
because of her reverence.
Now, if this is a competition,
and you're trying to win,
you need to take a risk,
but that's the wrong risk
to take.
- Jujubee.
- She was not in the most
fabulous outfit.
Merle, I'm surprised you didn't
pick her apart.
- I would have if it was
on somebody else,
but something
about her comedy
and her wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
- Let's talk about her
performance as Kimora.
- As a comedian, that makeup
on her neck--what?
- That was a good detail.
- You know, the performance
could have just been okay,
but that attention to detail--
- Yes, and it's those
little things
that make a character
come to life.
- It's so true.
- Okay, silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Pandora Boxx, you delivered
another standout performance,
but you were overshadowed
by one of your competitors.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Tatianna, you may have looked
a little cheap on the runway,
but in the challenge
you displayed a level of
confidence and professionalism
that is worthy of the next
drag superstar.
Congratulations, you're
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- You've won immunity
for next week,
plus a $1,000 shopping spree
from billiondollarbabes.com.
- It's just validating.
I really am meant to be here,
and there really is something
special in me.
- Congratulations, Tatianna.
You earned this one.
- Thank you so much.
[sniffling]
- Sonique,
you're a beautiful doll,
but we were not gagging
on the eleganza of your Gaga.
It was a risky choice and one
that did not pay off.
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.
- Being in the bottom was just
so fucking nerve-racking.
- Morgan McMichaels,
you were pretty in pink.
- Thank you.
- But your performance left us
a little blue.
You're up for elimination.
- First time in the bottom two
sucks.
I knew I was going to be there,
and I knew I deserved
to be there.
- Jujubee, I've saved you
for last,
because I want to light
a fire under you.
You keep landing in the middle
of the pack.
Turn up the heat,
or you could go down in flames.
- I won't.
- You are safe.
Please join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges,
but the final decision is mine
to make.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.
And remember, good luck
and don't fuck it up.

Whoo-hoo!
- Sonique, Morgan McMichaels,
you both approached this with
two completely different styles.
Morgan, the precision of your
lip-sync
was one of the tightest
we've ever seen.
Sonique, you pulled out
all the stops
and worked every inch
of this stage.
This choice has never been
so difficult.
But I've made my decision.
Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes?
- Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, sashay away.
[applause]
- I guess the hardest part of
this whole contest
was trying to find
the beauty in yourself.
Maybe I shoulda just stopped
being so serious.
There's more to life than just
being better than everyone,
and I definitely feel
more humble now.
- Ladies, you're all-stars,
but only one of you can be
the next drag superstar.
Remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?

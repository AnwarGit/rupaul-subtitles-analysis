00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,266
OF COURTNEY ACT?

170
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,967
- I KNOW. IT CONCERNS ME
THAT IT SEEMS CANNED

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,900
BECAUSE I TRULY FEEL
LIKE I COME FROM

172
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,367
THIS PLACE OF OBJECTIVITY,
AND I FEEL LIKE,

173
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
IN THE COMPETITION AS WELL,
I'M IN, LIKE, WORK MODE,

174
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,333
AND I'M FOCUSED
ON WORK.

175
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:32,300
- WE CAN ALL STAND FOR
A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMANITY,

176
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,600
EVEN IF THAT HUMANITY
SEEMS MESSY AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

177
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,166
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
THAT VULNERABILITY.

178
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,967
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,266
GIVE 'EM HELL
OUT THERE.

180
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,900
- I WILL. THANK YOU.

181
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,867
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, MOST
WORRIED ABOUT IN THIS CHALLENGE?

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,133
- I DON'T SEE
THE FUNCTION OF WORRY.

183
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,834
I THINK IT'S ALL
REALLY FUN.

184
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,533
- BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S TOP FOUR, BITCH.

185
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,533
LIKE, ANY TYPE OF, LIKE,
THING CAN HAPPEN

186
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,867
THAT CAN, LIKE,
SEND US HOME.

187
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,200
- WELL, YOU KNOW, RU SAID
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I TALK,

188
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,700
MY ANSWERS
CAN SOUND CANNED,

189
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:08,467
WHICH KIND OF CAME
AS A SHOCK,

190
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,633
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING I SAY

191
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,000
KIND OF COMES
FROM THE HEART.

192
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:17,867
AND I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
ENTIRELY WHAT SHE MEANS.

193
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,033
SO I CAN'T REALLY--

194
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,700
I'M NOT GONNA BLOW MY HEAD UP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

195
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,233
I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL EXCITED.

196
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,266
I'M HAPPY.
I'M DOING A WIG.

197
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,700
- IF YOU THINK FOR A MINUTE
THAT IT'S JUST A CAKEWALK...

198
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,033
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
THE LAST CHALLENGE.

199
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,500
I SEW, AND THIS BITCH
TAKES THE CAKE.

200
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,233
ALL OF US
SHOULD BE NERVOUS.

201
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,033
SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME,

202
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,600
AND WITH THAT CONFIDENCE,
IT MIGHT BE HER.

203
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,266
- COMING UP...

204
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,100
- SHE NEEDS TO IMPRESS
THE JUDGES,

205
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:47,233
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE CAN.

206

[RU PAUL LAUGHING]

207
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,867
- WHY, DARIENNE LAKE.
- HI, RU. HELLO, GORGEOUS.

208
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,000
- GET YOUR TUSH
IN HERE, DOLL.

209
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,667
SO, DARIENNE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FAMOUS.

210
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,400
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH
PEOPLE SAYING THINGS,

211
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,633
MOSTLY...B.S.?

212
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,633
- YOU KNOW, I CAN BRUSH OFF
WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME

213
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,200
BECAUSE GROWING UP,
I'VE HEARD HORRIBLE THINGS.

214
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:17,834
- YOU WERE THROWN OUT OF
THE HOUSE AS A KID, WEREN'T YOU?

215
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,767
- IT WASN'T "PACK
YOUR BAGS AND LEAVE."

216
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,266
IT WAS MORE LIKE
AN INVITATION TO LEAVE.

217
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,066
MY MOTHER SAID, "YOU HAVE A LOT
OF NERVE TO STAND THERE

218
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
"IN MY HOUSE ON MY DIME

219
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,667
AND LIVE YOUR LIFESTYLE
THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF."

220
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,533
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"YOU'RE A CLOWN.

221
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,266
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU."

222
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,567
AND I THINK SHE STILL HAS
THAT WHOLE THING

223
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,133
THAT QUEERS ARE BELOW
ANY OTHER PERSON.

224
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,133
THERE WAS A LOT OF YEARS
OF NOT LOVING MYSELF.

225
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,467
- LOVING YOURSELF--IT REALLY
TAKES A DAILY PRACTICE.

226
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,834
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

227
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,834
- THERE ARE THINGS
I'M GETTING FROM RU

228
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,133
THAT I DON'T GET
FROM MY OWN MOTHER.

229
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:57,033
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS REALLY
ENRICHED THE LOVE OF MYSELF.

230
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,533
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

231
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,233
NOW GET YOUR ASS
BACK TO WORK.

232
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,367
YOU'VE GOT
A CROWN TO WIN.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

234
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,533

FOR THE FINAL RUNWAY LOOK,

235
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,567
BETWEEN, LIKE, THIS
OR TO GO FOR SOMETHING

236
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,266
WITH A BIT MORE PIZZAZZ.

237
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,700
THIS IS THE FINAL TIME I'M GONNA
BE WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY.

238
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:18,767
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M GLITTERY AND FABULOUS.

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,367
THIS IS, LIKE,
A FEATHER BACKPACK

240
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,033
THAT'S GOT, LIKE, BIG PHEASANT
FEATHERS COMING OUT THE BACK.

241
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,633
THAT'S CUTE.

242
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,734
- I HAVE A HOODED THING
AS WELL.

243
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,200
- AH...

244
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,367
THAT'S PRETTY.

245
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,900
- MAYBE THIS IS
MY OPPORTUNITY

246
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,100
TO WEAR MY PRISCILLA WIG.

247
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:40,100
IT'S A LITTLE HOMAGE TO
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.

248
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,934

EXPENSIVE-ASS GOWNS

249
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,367
OR ACCESSORIES
TO THE MAX,

250
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,667
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT
TO BE A FUCKIN' STAR.

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,533
LIKE, YOU CAN WEAR
A PAPER BAG,

AND YOU CAN SEE
OUT OF THE CROWD

253
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:57,734
WHO IS GONNA BE SOMETHING
OR WHO IS SOMETHING ALREADY.

254
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,333
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR YET?

255
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,700
- I'LL WEAR
SOMETHING CUTE.

256
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:05,433
- ADORE REMINDS ME
OF ME 10 YEARS AGO.

257

THERE WAS, LIKE,
A SPARK AND A TALENT THERE,

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,066
BUT THERE WASN'T
THE REFINEMENT.

AT THE LAST SUPPER.

- WELL, HERE YOU ARE,
TOP FOUR.

265
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,767

- YOU'RE VERY ASTUTE.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BETTER PLAYERS

WE'VE HAD COME THROUGH HERE.
WHERE'S THAT COME FROM?

268
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,433
- I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

269
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,500
THAT HAVE TAUGHT ME
THAT, YOU KNOW,

270
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,300
THAT WERE LIKE, "QUEEN,
YOU DON'T NEED TO WEAR THAT WIG,

271
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,433
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT,"
AND NOW I CATCH MYSELF

272
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,500
ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS
SAYING THINGS TO OTHER QUEENS,

273
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:45,066
AND I'M LIKE, "I SOUND
LIKE THE OLD ONE NOW, YOU KNOW."

274
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,200
- NOW THE REST OF THE WORLD
WILL SEE THAT NICER SIDE.

275
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,800
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR THAT?

276
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,233
- YOU'VE BEEN FILMING THIS?

277
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,433
THERE'S TAPE
IN THOSE CAMERAS?

278
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:54,467
- YEAH.
- OH, GREAT!

279
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,

280
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,667
I HAD NO INTENTIONS
OF MENTORING ANY CHILD.

281
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,967
BUT IT'S BEEN
KIND OF REFRESHING

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,367
IN A WEIRD,
FUCKED-UP WAY.

283
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,100
- SO, ADORE, WHY SHOULD YOU
GET THE CROWN?

284
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,400
- THIS IS MY PASSION.
IT'S MY CALLING.

285
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,000
I WAS RAISED RIGHT,
SO I WOULD NOT LET YOU DOWN.

286
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,400
- SO, ADORE, YOU'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR MOM.

287
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,033
- YOU TALK ABOUT HER
ALL THE TIME.

288
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,834
- YEAH. LIKE, MY MOM
IS ALL I NEED.

289
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,567
SHE'S LIKE MY MOM, MY DAD,
MY GRANDPARENTS,

290
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,900
SHE'S EVERYTHING TO ME, SO...

291
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,500
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

292
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,100
- I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

293
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:28,166
- DO YOU WANT ONE?
WHY NOT?

294
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,433
- THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS

295
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,600
THAT HE SAID TO ME
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

296
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,467
WHEN I WAS 7,
HE SAID THAT, LIKE,

297
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
HE WAS BASICALLY
EMBARRASSED OF ME

298
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,834
BECAUSE I WAS FEMININE
AND I LIKED GIRL THINGS.

299
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,567
AND IT JUST REALLY
STUCK WITH ME.

300
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,767
THAT, I THINK, HAS A LOT
TO DO WITH MY CONFIDENCE.

301
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,033
LIKE, A LOT
OF MY FREAK-OUTS,

302
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,533
A LOT OF MY INSECURITIES
COME FROM THAT.

303
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,266
- A BONE, IN THE PLACE
IT WAS BROKEN,

304
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,834
AFTER IT HEALS, THAT BECOMES
THE STRONGEST PLACE ON THE BONE.

305
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,767
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

306
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,700
SO THAT BROKEN
PLACE IN YOU

307
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,633
CAN BE YOUR SPIRITUAL
RESURRECTION,

308
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,500
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A FABULOUS KID

309
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,967
AND YOU'VE GOT
LOTS OF TALENT.

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,066
AND HE'S REALLY
MISSING OUT.

311
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,166
WHAT'S YOUR MOM'S NAME?

312
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,433
- BONNIE.

313
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,000
DO THIS FOR BONNIE.

SHE'S THE ONE ROOTING
FOR YOU BACK HOME.

AND YOU GO OUT THERE,

316
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:18,467
AND YOU DON'T LET THE SABOTEUR
GET YOU OFF THE TRACK.

317
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,367
- NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOOT
OUR DANCE ROUTINE

318
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
FOR "SISSY THAT WALK"
BY RU PAUL.

319
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:31,367
- LADIES, I REALLY WANT YOU
TO LOOK LIKE A PERFORMANCE,

320
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,400

OK? CUE THE MUSIC.

ADORE, DARIENNE,
YOU HAVE TO BE IN SYNC

327
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,633
FOR IT TO LOOK RIGHT.

328
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,533
THAT WAS NOT $100,000
CHOREOGRAPHY RIGHT THERE.

329
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:54,934
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE SCRUFF
PIT CREW WITH THE FANS.

330

YOU SOLD ME ON IT.

676
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,567
- THANK YOU, ADORE.
- THANK YOU, RU.

677
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,100
- NEXT UP, BLAME IT
ON BIANCA DEL RIO.

678
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,867
- TONIGHT THIS COLOR
IS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.

679
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
- THANKS.
- AS A GROUP,

680
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,567
YOU AND COURTNEY ACT TOGETHER
REALLY WERE IN SYNC,

681
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,900
AND IT LOOKED GREAT.

682
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,700
- SOLO I THOUGHT YOU DID
A GOOD JOB AS WELL.

683
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:19,100
IT'S FUN TO SEE YOU
IN A SEXY LIGHT.

684
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:23,200
- FOR YOUR INGENUE,
YOUR EXPRESSIONS WERE SO FUNNY.

685
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,100
- AND THE IMPROV
WAS PHENOMENAL.

686
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,467
IT BEARS REPEATING.
IT WAS VERY FUNNY.

687
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,667
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.

688
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,000
TONIGHT, YOU LOOK FLAWLESS.

689
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:37,300
I DON'T THINK
I'D CHANGE A THING.

690
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,500
[LAUGHTER]

691
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:42,633
YEAH, REALLY,
JUST VERY, VERY HAPPY.

692
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,066
- YOU SHOULD BE ON THE COVER
OF "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE.

693
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,700
YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR OWN SPREAD.

694
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,834
- LET'S DO IT.
- AS THE INGENUE,

695
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:51,600
THE SLAPS WERE REALLY FUNNY.
YOU WENT THERE.

696
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:54,133
AS SISSY WITH CHARLES,

697
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,033
THE PROPS,
LIKE THE GLASSES,

698
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,533
THEY KIND OF DISTRACTED
FROM YOUR FACE.

699
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,000
- GROUP CHOREOGRAPHY--
YOU NAILED IT.

700
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,367
- LOVED THE WIDE SHOTS,

701
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,000
BUT THE CLOSE-UPS SEEMS
SO FRENETIC AND KIND OF, UH...

702
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,000
TOO MUCH.

703
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:11,533
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
DARIENNE LAKE.

704
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:14,166
- TONIGHT IS JUST
CLASSIC DARIENNE,

705
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,500
AND IT'S SO,
SO BEAUTIFUL.

706
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,400
- YOUR LIP-SYNCING
IS SO MAJOR

707
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,767
IN YOUR PIECE
AS THE INGENUE,

708
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
I COULD WATCH THAT
ON REPEAT FOR HOURS.

709
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:27,166
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.

710
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,867
- AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE

711
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,300
WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS,
FLAT-LINED.

712
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,066
YOU DIDN'T REALLY GET IT GOING
TILL THE END.

713
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,734
BUT THEN WHEN YOU DID
GET IT GOING,

714
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,266
YOU KEPT IT GOING.

715
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,233
THAT WAS
THE MAGICAL PART.

716
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,000
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, DARIENNE.

717
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,333
LADIES, FINAL QUESTION--

718
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,767
WHY SHOULD YOU
AND NOT YOUR COMPETITORS

719
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,767
BE CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?'

720
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
LET'S START WITH ADORE.

721
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,100
- THESE GIRLS UP HERE
ARE ALL STARS,

722
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,800
BUT I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT IT.

723
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,800
I'M AMERICA'S NEXT
DRAG SUPERSTAR.

724
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,033
I FEEL LIKE I'M RELATABLE.
I'M APPROACHABLE.

725
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,633
AND WITH THIS TITLE,
I WILL BE VERY PROUD

726
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,100
TO CARRY ON THE LEGACY

727
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,900
AND TEACH ALL THE LITTLE
MERMAIDS OF THE WORLD.

728
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,800
I JUST REALLY, REALLY
WANT TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

729
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,033
I'M ALREADY A WINNER,

730
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:15,433
BUT THE CROWN REALLY WOULD
COMPLETE THIS WHOLE LOOK

731
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,166
AND EVERYTHING.

732
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,266
AND I LOVE YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.

733
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,400
- THANK YOU, ADORE.

734
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,633
BIANCA DEL RIO.

735
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,834
- THERE'S AN OLD SAYING
THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH

736
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,066
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.

737
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,200
FOR ME, IT WASN'T GOING
THROUGH THE COMPETITION

738
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,700
WITH AN ADOLESCENT CHARM,
GOING THROUGH IT

739
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,533
WITH A FABULOUS BODY
AND BEAUTY,

740
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,500
OR GOING THROUGH IT
WITH GREAT LIP-SYNC TALENTS.

741
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,600
I HAD DRESSES, I HAD HAIR,
AND A GUARD.

742
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,200
I HAVE BUILT UP
THIS WALL,

743
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,166
AND THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS CHANGED ME,

744
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,767
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE THIS MAGICAL

745
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,633
OR THIS INSPIRING,
BUT IT IS.

746
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,333
I WENT THROUGH
A SELF-DISCOVERY,

747
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,533
ACCEPTING THAT I'M NOT
SUCH A BAD BITCH,

748
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,867
AND I THANK
ALL OF YOU PERSONALLY

749
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY CHILLY LITTLE HEART

750
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,233
THANKS.

751
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,633
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.

752
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,767
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT,
SAME QUESTION.

753
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,000
- IN AUSTRALIA,
I'M AUSTRALIA'S DRAG SUPERSTAR.

754
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,266
AND I'VE HAD SO MANY WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITIES THERE

755
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,567
TO HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MOMENTS
AND A LOT OF BAD MOMENTS

756
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
AND LEARN FROM
ALL OF THAT.

757
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,734
AND I SORT OF CAME
TO AMERICA

758
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,033
AS LIKE A POLISHED PRODUCT,

759
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,533
AND I FEEL THAT
I CAN TAKE THIS

760
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,033
AND I CAN MAKE
THE MOST OUT OF IT.

761
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,266
YOU SAY THIS IS
THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG,

762
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,033
AND I WANT TO TAKE
THAT OLYMPIC TORCH,

763
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,333
AND I WANT TO KEEP
RUNNING WITH IT,

764
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:30,533
AND I WANT TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.

765
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:31,567
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.

766
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,667
- THANK YOU.

767
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,734
- DARIENNE LAKE.

768
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:39,200
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MORE QUEEN PER POUND.

769
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,834
THERE IS NO
COMPARING ME TO OTHERS.

770
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,533
ADORE, SOMETIMES
YOU GET A LITTLE RATTLED.

771
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,033
BIANCA, I COULD TEACH YOU

772
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,467
MAYBE A LITTLE THING
ABOUT SENSITIVITY.

773
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,200
COURTNEY,
WHAT A SEXY DISH,

774
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,934
BUT THIS DISH
NEEDS A LITTLE SALT.

775
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,333
YOU HAVE SEEN
MY TALENTS.

776
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:56,900
I WILL MAKE EVERYONE
WHO IS SITTING THERE

777
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,367
THINKING THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

778
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,200
THAT IF THIS OLD
BITTER QUEEN CAN DO IT,

779
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,400
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
THANK YOU.

780
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:06,567
- THANK YOU, DARIENNE.

781
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,033
WELL, THANK YOU,
MY QUEENS.

782
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,300
I THINK
WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

783
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,834
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,

784
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,300
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

785
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,700
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US SQUIRRELS,

786
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:23,533
WHAT DID WE THINK?
LET'S START WITH ADORE.

787
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:28,166
ADORE IS 23 YEARS OLD, AND HER
SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE

788
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,533
SPOKE LIKE SOMEONE
WHO'S 23 YEARS OLD.

789
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:33,166
- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
SHE WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART,

790
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,667
AND SHE GOT
HER POINT ACROSS.

791
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
- ADORE'S ACTING
WAS SO WELL DONE,

792
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,867
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
A REAL SCENE.

793
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,200
- SHE'S A PERFORMER.
ADORE IS DEFINITELY A SUPERSTAR.

794
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,500
- SHE LIKES THE SORT OF
TRASHY-GIRL AESTHETIC.

795
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,367
- BUT SHE'S JUST
SO DAMN CHARMING

796
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,333
THAT NO MATTER
WHAT SHE DOES,

797
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,934
I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF OF HER.

798
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,767
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
BIANCA DEL RIO.

799
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,200
- HER INGENUE WAS FUNNY,

800
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,934
AND SHE BRINGS HER INTELLIGENCE
TO THE GAME.

801
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,800
- IT BEARS REPEATING.
- IT'S HILARIOUS.

802
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:04,433
- TO ME, BIANCA COMES OFF
AS USING COMEDY AS A WALL.

803
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:08,100
HER SHTICK IS, "COLD AS ICE,
MY HEART IS BLACK."

804
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,800
- YEAH, HER HUMOR CAN BE
A LITTLE ABRASIVE AND DANGEROUS.

805
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,467
IS THAT THE BEST CHOICE
FOR THE BRAND?

806
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
- BUT THAT SPEECH THAT SHE MADE
WAS PRETTY AMAZING.

807
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,367
IT'S INTERESTING JUST SEEING
HER VULNERABILITY,

808
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,066
AND SHE HAD NO PROBLEM
HELPING THE OTHER GIRLS

809
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,533
BACK IN THE WORK ROOM

810
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,834
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
THREATENED BY THEM.

811
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:25,800
- NO.

812
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,033
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE HAD

813
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,500
MORE VARIETY IN
HER RUNWAY LOOKS, THOUGH.

814
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,500
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.

815
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:33,467
- IT'S OBVIOUS
THE CAMERA LOVES HER.

816
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,333
- YES. SHE HAS A PRESENCE.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

817
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,200
- HER ACTING TWO CHALLENGE
WAS INTERESTING.

818
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:40,200
SHE HAD ALL THE SHTICK
WITH THE STRAW IN HER HAIR,

819
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,233
THE GLASSES COCKEYED.

820
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:44,633
- NOTHING WAS SUBTLE
ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE.

821
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,367
- BUT SHE DID ALLUDE
TO THE FACT

822
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,133
THAT SHE DOESN'T SPEAK WITH
AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ANYMORE.

823
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,467
- WHICH I APPRECIATED.
- IT'S SUPER FUNNY.

824
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,367
- NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
HER SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE.

825
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,300
- SHE'S AUSTRALIA'S
VERSION OF RU PAUL.

826
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,166
- RIGHT. THAT'S NOT
STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME.

827
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,633
I WANTED HER
TO MOVE ME.

828
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,100
- I DON'T GET MAD
WHEN PEOPLE TALK LIKE THAT,

829
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,800
ESPECIALLY
FROM COURTNEY ACT,

830
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,533
WHO I THINK IS
AN IMMENSE TALENT

831
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:08,367
AND WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.

832
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,867
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO DARIENNE LAKE.

833
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,233
- THE SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE,
WHEN SHE STARTED TO BREAK DOWN,

834
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:14,767
THEN I GOT SUCKED IN.

835
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,367
- HER DELIVERY WAS
JUST HILARIOUS, JUST SO FUNNY.

836
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,600
- AND IT EVEN MADE CHARLES
COME BACK IN AND GET HER.

837
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:22,867
- IN THE SISSY-OGRAPHY,

838
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,567
DARIENNE LAKE GOT DOWN
WITH THE GET-DOWN.

839
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,467
- SHE'S A FIERCE LIP-SYNCER.
- SHE IS.

840
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,533
- YOU KNOW, ALL ABOUT
SELLING FACE CONSTANTLY.

841

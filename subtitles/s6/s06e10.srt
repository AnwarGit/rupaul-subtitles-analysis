- I THINK I WANT MISS EDDIE.
COME THIS WAY.

172
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,800
- GREAT. HEY!

173
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,266
- SHE SEEMS SASSY.

174
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,934
AMY, YOU SEEM LIKE YOU
WOULD DO WELL WITH ADORE.

175
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,433
- HI.

176
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,734
- YOU SEEM LIKE
A COURTNEY TYPE.

177
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:41,834
- OK.

178
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,133
- BLONDE.

179
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,300
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

180
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,834
- ANNA,
THIS IS DARIENNE.

181
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,133
- OH, HI!

182
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,100
- AMY,
THIS IS BENDELA.

183
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,533
- HI, AMY.

184
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,233
- NOW, LADIES,
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING

185
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,233
FOR A STRONG FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE.

186
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,166
YOU'LL USE MATERIALS
FROM FABRIC PLANET

187
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,100
AND YOUR OWN DRAG.

188
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,800
AS DRAG MOTHERS OF THE BRIDE,
I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR

189
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,033
CHARISMA, UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT TO MAKE THEIR WEDDING

190
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:15,400
THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF THEIR LIFE, BUT TO DO THAT,

191
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,300
FIRST YOU NEED TO
MEET THE GROOMS.

192
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,000
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,767
NOW, FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE, YOU WON'T BE MAKING

194
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,200
OVER THESE WOMEN.

195
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:33,266
NO, NO, THAT'D BE TOO EASY.

196
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:39,033
INSTEAD, YOU'LL USE THE MAGIC
OF DRAG TO TRANSFORM THESE

197
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:43,734
GALLANT GROOMS INTO
BLUSHING BRIDES.

198
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:46,934
IT'S A NICE DAY FOR
A DRAG WEDDING.

199
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,400
[LAUGHTER]

200
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,533
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY THE BEST

201
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,734
WOMAN WIN.

202
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,800
- I DON'T DO PEOPLE'S MAKEUP.

203
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,633
I DON'T SEW.

204
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,867
I'M JUST GONNA FUCKIN' SIT ON
A CONE AND WAIT FOR A TRUCK TO

205
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,467
HIT ME AT THIS POINT.

206
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,700
I SWEAR TO GOD.
I'M OVER IT.

207
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
- OH, NO!

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,066
- COMING UP...

209
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,867
- IS IT GONNA HANG
LIKE A BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?

210
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:12,467
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.

211
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,767
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.

212
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,667
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.

213
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,133
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?

214
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,100
[ENGINE REVS]

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,967
[ENGINE REVS]

216
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,433
- OUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO
TURN STRAIGHT GROOMS INTO

217
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,900
BLUSHING BRIDES.

218
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,233
THE KEY TO BRIDAL WEAR IS
MAKING SURE THE BRIDE IS HAPPY,

219
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,333
SO THE FIRST THING WE DO IS
SIT DOWN WITH OUR COUPLES

220
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,400
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'D
LIKE FOR THEIR WEDDING.

221
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,734
ALL RIGHT, HOW DO
WE FEEL ABOUT MAKEUP?

222
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:41,967
ARE WE THINKING A SOFT
EYE AND A BRIGHT LIP?

223
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,066
OR ARE WE THINKING
A DOMINANT EYE?

224
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,700
- I THINK A DOMINANT EYE
AND A DOMINANT LIP.

225
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,066
- OH, YOU ARE MY KIND
OF GIRL, EDDIE!

226
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:51,266
- YES.

227
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,533
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

228
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,967
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT
THIS CHALLENGE.

229
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,100
I'M CURRENTLY ENGAGED,
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING WEDDING.

230
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,066
THIS IS JUST
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

231
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,533
OK, SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF VISION?

232
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:08,133
- I CAN SEE A
FLORULENT PRINCESS LOOK.

233
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,867
- YOU'RE GONNA LOOK SO PURTY.

234
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,567
- PRETTY.

235
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,633
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]

236
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,934
- WE CAN GIVE YOU SOME PADDING,
TOO, SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME WIDER

237
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,600
HIPS SO YOU'LL HAVE SOME BODY.

238
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,567
- OH, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT BODY.

239
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:25,667
- AREN'T YOU GETTING EXCITED?

240
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,500
I DON'T THINK BRANDON HAS
ANY IDEA WHAT HE SIGNED

241
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,400
HIMSELF UP FOR.

242
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,433
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SHAVING?

243
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,400
- I'M OK WITH THAT.
- YEAH?

244
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,934
- WE CAN WORK
WITH IT, YEAH.

245
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,133
- OK, COOL.

246
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,834
- I'VE NEVER SEEN KEVIN
WITHOUT A BEARD, SO I'M

247
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,700
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.

248
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,166
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
SAW YOURSELF WITHOUT A BEARD?

249
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,667
- 6 YEARS.

250
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,400
- THE MOST WORRISOME THING
ABOUT THE BEARD IS NOT KNOWING

251
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,934
WHAT'S UNDER THERE.

252
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,800
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,500
- SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT FOR THIS WEDDING?

254
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,900
- I WOULD LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING, LIKE,
MORE GOTHY AND COOL.

255
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,800
YOU KNOW, ROCK AND ROLL,
HORROR, AND NOT TRADITIONAL.

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,100
- HE NEEDS TO LOOK FIERCE,
LIKE SHARON AND DETOX.

257
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
- OK, SHARON AND DETOX,
SORT OF?

258
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,166
- YEAH.

259
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,233
- SO, GOTH?

260
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:15,767
THE MATERIALS SUPPLIED ARE
WHITE, SILVER--NOT GOTH.

261
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,667
AAAH!

262
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:21,367
- YOU'RE QUITE A TALL,
SOLID MAN.

263
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:24,633
MY ONLY WEAKNESS IS, YOU DON'T
HAPPEN TO BE A TAILOR, DO YOU?

264
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,900
YOU WEREN'T A TAILOR IN
THE ARMY, WERE YOU? NO.

265
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,734
- IF YOU HAVE ANY BOMBS LAYING
AROUND, I CAN DISARM THEM.

266
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:33,500
- COURTNEY MIGHT HAVE A LOT
MORE TROUBLE TRANSFORMING

267
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,567
A MANLY MAN, BECAUSE COURTNEY
ONLY WEARS CHAPSTICK

268
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,533
AND MASCARA.

269
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,233
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.

270
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,734
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.

271
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,333
IT'LL BE HOT.

272
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,333
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE SAY.

273
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,967
"OH, SHE'S BEATING HER FACE"

274
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,433
MEANS THAT SHE'S DOING,
LIKE, A GOOD JOB
ON DOING HER MAKEUP.

275
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,600
- OK.

276
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,233
- YEAH, IT'S LINGO.
- OH!

277
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,500
- "I'M GONNA
BEAT YOUR FACE"--

278
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,734
IT MEANS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

279
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,867
- OH, NO!

280
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:02,233
I CAN DO YOUR FACE, BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEW.

281
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,867
- LIKE,
I ENVISION MY WEDDING,

282
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,767
LIKE, VERA WANG WITH, LIKE,
A NICE POOFY DRESS,

283
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,867
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S, LIKE, VERY ELEGANT.

284
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,200
- ELEGANT?

285
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,834
I'M NOT SURE IF SHE HEARD
ME WHEN I SAID I DON'T KNOW

286
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,033
HOW TO SEW.

287
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,066
- ATTENTION, WOMEN.

288
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:22,600
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BE
FITTED FOR YOUR SUITS FROM

289
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,333
HER TUXEDO.

290
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,900
SO KISS YOUR FELLAS, AND
SAY GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.

291
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,066
- I LOVE YOU.
- DON'T FUCK IT UP.

292
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,734
- LET'S GO GET SOME MATERIALS.

293
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,533
- OK.

294
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,600
- OH!

295
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,400
- HOW AM I WALK
IN THESE THINGS?

296
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,100
- POP YOUR HEAD THROUGH THERE.

297
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
AND THEN THIS ONE DOESN'T
QUITE HAVE A SLEEVE YET.

298
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,100
- OK, SO WE'LL JUST
PUT IT THROUGH

299
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,934
LIKE A LITTLE--LIKE
A MONK ROBE.

300
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,266
- YEAH.

301
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,333
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.

302
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,834
- IS IT GONNA HANG LIKE A
BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?

303
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,700
- I THINK COURTNEY HAS A
REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE

304
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,133
BECAUSE SHE'S USED TO DESIGNER
GOWNS MADE FOR HER THAT

305
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,834
ARE...(HIGH-PITCHED) THIS BIG.

306
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,934
(HIGH-PITCHED) HOW
ABOUT FOR THIS BIG?

307
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,467
NO.

308
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,967
- WELL, JUST SO
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT

309
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:13,266
GONNA HIT ON YOU, BECAUSE
I'M NOT REALLY RECRUITING.

310
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,867
THERE'S ENOUGH GAYS IN THIS
WORLD, SO...AND NOW THAT THEY

311
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,967
CAN GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A MESS.

312
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,934
- I'M FROM HOLLAND, THE MOST
LIBERAL COUNTRY PROBABLY

313
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,934
IN THE WORLD, AND IT'S
VERY NORMAL FOR, YOU KNOW,

314
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,433
GAY COUPLES BE MARRIED.

315
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,900
- IN HOLLAND?

316
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,300
- OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW.

317
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,533
- THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.

318
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,467
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SLOW
HERE, BUT LUCKILY ALL THIS

319
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,900
IS CHANGING.

320
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,567
- YEAH, PEOPLE ARE FREE TO DO
WHAT THEY WANT, YOU KNOW?

321
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:33,967
- OH, TOTALLY.

322
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,934
IT'S REALLY REFRESHING TO HANG
AROUND SOMEONE WHO'S STRAIGHT

323
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,433
WITHOUT ANY HANG-UPS.

324
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,467
I'M REALIZING I
REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.

325
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,600
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
GIVING SOMEONE A HAIRCUT.

326
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,166
- VERY MUCH SO.

327
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,100
LOOK, I ACTUALLY MADE
A FRIEND TODAY.

328
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,934
ME. FRIEND.

329
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,433
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

330
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,533
- HI.

331
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,700
- HEY.

332

- LET'S GET THIS
BRIDAL PARTY STARTED.

333
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,100
- YAY.

334
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,900
- HI, JOSLYN.
- HEY, Ru-SIE Q.

335
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,633
- HI, BRANDON.
- HELLO.

336
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,266
- I KNOW YOU'RE A
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

337
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,767
- YES.
- TELL ME THIS.

338
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:08,333
WHAT WILL YOUR TEAMMATES
SAY WHEN THEY SEE YOU
ALL UP IN DRAG?

339
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,867

TO LET ME KNOW I'M GAY

AFRAID TO SCREAM OUT, "WHERE

TO MEET MY SOUL MATE.

IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

631
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,100
A FEW DAYS INTO OUR
RELATIONSHIP, MY LEGS WENT OUT,

- WOW.

666
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,300
WELL, JOSLYN LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
GORGEOUS, BUT IT LACKS SOME

667
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,033
SORT OF UNITY BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU.

668
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:35,667
- YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER--
THE FACE IS NOT HER COLOR.

669
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,000
SHE LOOKS METALLIC.

670
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,233
IT'S REALLY OFF-PUTTING.

671
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,934
- NOT LOVING THIS
WHOLE WEDDING GOWN.

672
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:45,066

THE DEFINITION THAT
WE WANT TO SEE.

- SO, BRADONNA, WAS THERE
ANYTHING YOU WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH?

674
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,867
- JUST MY MANLIHOOD
BEING QUESTIONED.

675
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,433
- AND WHO WAS QUESTIONING IT?

676
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:55,100
- NO ONE HERE, BUT IT
WILL BE QUESTIONED.

677
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,433
[LAUGHTER]

678
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,967
- THAT'S YET TO COME.

679
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,467
- REALLY?
- YEAH?

680
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,333
- WE GOT A RUNAWAY BRIDE.

681
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,433
- IS HE OK?

682
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,800
[BRADONNA VOMITING]

683
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,567
- JOSLYN, WILL YOU CHECK
ON YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER?

684
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,967
[BRADONNA VOMITING]

685
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,934
- NO, DON'T BE SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

686
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:34,433
- SO WHILE WE SORT THAT OUT,
WE WILL CONTINUE

687
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,967
WITH THE CRITIQUES.

688
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,867
- NEXT UP IS COURTNEY ACT.

689
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,934
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT STEVE BEFORE...

690
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,433
- WOW.

691
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,400
- AND AFTER AS RIEN ACT.

692
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,433
WUBBA, WUBBA.
DO YOU FEEL PRETTY?

693
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,934
- I FEEL HOTTER THAN MY WIFE.

694
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,066
- OH!

695
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,834
- YOU'RE GETTING A
BACKHAND FOR THAT.

696
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,567
WHY DID WE GO
WITH THIS LENGTH?

697
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,200
- UM, WELL, WE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE DOING,

698
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,100
LIKE, A LITTLE SOUTHERN
LOUISIANA WEDDING, AND, UM...

699
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,133
- YOU THINK
THAT SAYS LOUISIANA?

700
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:04,200
- I REALLY FELT THAT YOU'RE
THE BRIDE, AND RIEN ACT IS

701
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,266
YOUR MOTHER, IN A WAY.

702
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,633
- I'M LIKE THE COUGAR MOM AT
THE WEDDING WHO HITS ON ALL

703
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,433
OF THE DAUGHTER'S
SINGLE FRIENDS.

704
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,133
- UH, YOU'D SHOW ME UP
AT MY WEDDING LIKE THAT,

705
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,800
BITCH, YOU'RE GOING HOME.

706
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,734
- NEXT UP, BIANCA
DEL RIO AND ALEX.

707
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,900
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT ALEX BEFORE...

708
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,433
- HUBBA, HUBBA.
- MM-HMM.

709
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:25,867
- AND AFTER, FIFI DEL RIO.

710
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,700
- I THINK THE
DEL RIOS NAILED IT.

711
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,266
- THE FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE IS ON POINT.

712
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,400
I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE
BIT OF A TRAIN IN THE BACK.

713
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,934
- I MEAN, HE WAS BATTLING
SHOES ALREADY AND EYELASHES

714
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,100
AND HIS BALLS AND HIS ASS.

715
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,533
I MEAN, DID I REALLY WANT TO
GIVE HIM A TRAIN, TOO?

716
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,900
[LAUGHTER]

717
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WORKING WITH BIANCA?

718
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
- IT WAS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU, MOMMY.

719
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,867
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

720
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,467
DON'T CALL ME MOMMY
IN PUBLIC.

721
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:51,133
[LAUGHTER]

722
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,633
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE AND DAMON.

723
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT DAMON BEFORE.

724
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,033
- WOW, UNREAL.

725
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,967
- NOW, DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL DO DRAG AGAIN?

726
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,667
- I MIGHT TRY
OUT FOR THE SHOW.

727
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,333
[LAUGHTER]

728
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,333
- MY WORD.

729
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,967
- IT'S KIND OF A RISK YOU
GOING AWAY FROM, LIKE,

730
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:12,166
A TRADITIONAL WEDDING GOWN,
BUT IT FITS YOUR PERSONALITY,

731
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,834
AND WE'RE FEELING YOUR
ENERGY, DEFINITELY.

732
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,934
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING,
AND I DIDN'T GET GOTH FROM

733
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,667
YOU EITHER.

734
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:24,166
YOUR OUTFIT TO ME SEEMS
A LITTLE COCKTAIL PARTY
DRESS TO ME.

735
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,867
- NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME AND KEVIN.

736
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,900
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT KEVIN BEFORE...

737
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,000
- ANOTHER BEARD.

738
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,200
- AND AFTER,
SUZETTE A LA MODE.

739
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,100
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
SEEN A LITTLE MORE OF THAT

740
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,934
KIND OF SEVERE ANGLE THAT YOU
DO ON YOUR OWN EYE MAKEUP.

741
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:43,934
LOVE THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL ON ALL THE ROSETTES.

742
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:46,000
OVERALL, WELL DONE.

743
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,967
- AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOUR WIFE HAS SEEN YOU

744
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,300
WITHOUT A BEARD.

745
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,867
- YES, EVER.

746
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:55,400
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 6 YEARS, AND I'VE
HAD THE BEARD FOR 7,

747
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,467
SO SHE'S NEVER SEEN
ME WITHOUT IT UNTIL TODAY.

748
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,734
- I BET SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO
THE HELL SHE WAS MARRYING.

749
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,934
[LAUGHTER]

750
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:04,800
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.

751
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,266
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
RYAN BEFORE...

752
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,533
- MM.

753
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,767
- AND AFTERWARD AS
HONEY BUN DELANO.

754
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,400
- IT'S ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF A MESS KIND OF FOR ME.

755
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,567
I JUST WISH THAT THE OVERALL
EXECUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN

756
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,133
MORE ON POINT.

757
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,400
- NOW,
WHAT KIND OF BRIDE DID

758
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,500
YOU AND AMY WANT TO BE?

759
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,867
AFTER TALKING WITH ADORE,
WE DECIDED TO GO MORE

760
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,767
IN A PUNK DIRECTION.

761
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,934
- I LOVE THAT YOU WANT
TO PUT FUN INTO IT
AND STUFF LIKE THAT...

762
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,333
- YEAH.

763
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,500
- BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU WERE HER MOTHER AT ALL.

764
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,800
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE I SEE ANY
KIND OF A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.

765
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,266
I THINK YOU FAILED THAT PART.

766
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,467
- THANK YOU, LADIES.

767
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:43,066
WHILE YOU UNTUCK IN THE
FORMDECOR LOUNGE, THE JUDGES

768
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:45,166
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.

769
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:49,400
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US IN-LAWS, LET'S START

770
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,834
WITH THE FOXES.

771
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:54,033
- THE DRESS WAS A DISASTER.

772
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,700
IT WAS LIKE SCHLUMP IN HEELS.

773
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,000
- I FEEL SO BAD THAT
BRANDON GOT SICK, BUT I KIND

774
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,433
OF WOULD'VE FELT THE SAME WAY
IF I LIFTED THE VEIL
AND MY FACE LOOKED LIKE THAT.

775
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,266
- HA HA!

776
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,667
- COURTNEY ACT AND RIEN ACT.

777
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,100
- OVERALL, THE
MAKEUP LOOKED GREAT.

778
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,533
THEIR HAIR LOOKED GREAT.

779
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:13,533
BUT THE OUTFIT THAT RIEN ACT HAD
LOOKED SORT OF LIKE A BEDSPREAD.

780
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,367
- I WAS SO AFFECTED BY THE
DRAG MOTHER STEALING ALL

781
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,367
THE LIMELIGHT--
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

782
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:20,367
- BIANCA DEL RIO
AND FIFI DEL RIO.

783
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:23,066
- THE DRESS WAS ON
POINT AND WELL DONE.

784
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:26,433
- I WOULD MISTAKE FIFI AS
A WOMAN IF I SAW HER

785
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,633
ON THE STREET.

786
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,800
- DAVID, YOU DON'T GET
OUT TOO OFTEN, DO YOU?

787
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,100
[LAUGHTER]

788
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,734
- NO.

789
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:36,767
- ALL RIGHT, DARIENNE LAKE
AND ANN DROGYNY LAKE.

790
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,300
- I LOVE THE GOTH KIND
OF EMO BRIDE.

791
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,000
- I JUST WISH DARIENNE
WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT FURTHER.

792
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,533
- IT MADE NO SENSE.

793
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:47,066
IT WAS EDGAR ALLAN POE MEETS
NEW JERSEY HOUSEWIFE MOM.

794
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:49,467
SHE WAS MY LEAST
FAVORITE OF ALL OF THEM.

795
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:53,233
- BENDELACREME AND
SUZETTE A LA MODE.

796
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:56,467
- THE TRANSFORMATION WITH
KEVIN WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

797
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,233
- BENDELA LOOKED GREAT.

798
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:00,266
THE COLOR WAS TERRIFIC ON HER.

799
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,800
- ADORE AND HONEY BUN DELANO.

800
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,767
- THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL IS NONEXISTENT.

801
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:11,934
ALL THAT BLACK UNDERNEATH THE
EYE--NOT FLATTERING, ROUGH.

802
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,233
ROUGH, ROUGH, ROUGH.

803
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,433
- AND I CAN'T EVEN SAY
SHE FOCUSED ON HERSELF,

804
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,066
BECAUSE THAT WAS A MESS TOO.

805
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:19,567
THEY WERE BOTH A DISASTER.

806
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,133
- SO, NEIL, OF THE
OUTFITS UP THERE,

807
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,533
WHICH ONE WOULD
YOU WEAR RIGHT NOW?

808
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,967
- OH, COURTNEY ACT'S.
- COURTNEY ACT'S.

809
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,900
- TOTALLY NUDE
WITH BUTTERFLIES.

810
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,367
- YOU SLUT.
- IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.

811
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,133
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE SUCH A WHORE.

812
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,734
WE SHOULD GO
SOMEWHERE TOGETHER.

813
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:33,934
- HOW DARE YOU!

814
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,233
[LAUGHTER]

815
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,367
- SILENCE.

816
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,066
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

817
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:43,734
BRING BACK THE DIVORCE LAWYER.

818
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:46,934
[ENGINE REVS]

819
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,633
[ENGINE REVS]

820
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,934
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

821
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:54,500
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.

822
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,934
- MY HEART'S POUNDING
OUT OF MY CHEST.

823
00:35:56,934 --> 00:36:01,100
- BENDELACREME, YOU GAVE
SUZETTE AND AMY A WEDDING

824
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,367
THEY'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER,
AND YOU LEFT US TICKLED PINK.

825
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,233
YOU ARE SAFE.

826
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,367
- THANK YOU.

827
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,633
- YAY!

828
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:19,667
- BIANCA DEL RIO, WE LOVED
YOUR MAKEOVER SO MUCH, YOU ARE

829
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,767
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.

830
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,533
[APPLAUSE]

831
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,734
- I KNEW IT.

832
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,066
- YAY.

833
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:30,433
- AND YOU'VE WON A TRIP FOR
TWO TO THE HONEYMOON PARADISE

834
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:32,200
OF HAWAII.

835
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,367
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

836
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,800
- AND SO HAS YOUR COUPLE,
ALEX AND EDDIE.

837
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,667
- OH, MY GOD!

838
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:42,567
- I'M GOING TO HAWAII.
HEH HEH HEH!

839
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:48,066
- ADORE DELANO, YOUR PUNK
BRIDE GAVE US A SERIOUS CASE

840
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,767
OF THE WEDDING BELL BLUES.

841
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:55,500
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR, BUT
YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.

842
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,967

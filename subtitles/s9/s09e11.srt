             Girl,              
    you know what they say.

135
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,776
    Power top, lazy bottom.

136
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:17,146
       Ow! You do realize       
     you got a little lace

137
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,380
    right here on your wig.

138
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,547
       Let me get that--

00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:26,251
         - I told y'all         
      don't touch my wigs.

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,453
   - Trinity, where are you?

143
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,087
    - I'm right here, girl.

144
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,956
        I've gotta say,         
 I've learned a lot about drag

145
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,290
     since I've been here.

146
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,792
            It isn't            
      just about silicone.

147
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:41,162
   It's also about restylane,   
             botox,

148
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,097
     and this little thing      
        called hot glue

149
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,833
         that I'm just

       talking about sex.

152
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,738
          - Oh, girl,           
        I like fisting,

153
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,774
    glory holes, horse play.

154
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,076
   That's where you have sex

       How are you, Shea?

164
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:18,090
       Well, you have won       
a lot of challenges this season,

165
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,492
       but it sure isn't        
     on that makeup, is it?

166
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,593
       - Well, you know,

167
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:24,896
      this is how we do it      
       in Chicago, bitch.

168
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,732
   - You know, you might want   
  to check your kitchen, girl,

169
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,167
 'cause, you know, you already  
 been clocked about that once.

170
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,735
     - What you mean, girl?

171
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:33,436
       I have disco butt.

172
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:37,372
    - You don't really have     
 that much body, do you, honey?

173
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:39,674
          Do you need           
      to go see my doctor?

174
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:43,844
    - No. We do this natural    
          in Chicago.

175
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:48,080
     - Sasha, what is that      
       over on your hand?

176
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:51,682
  - The feathers are the bird   
 that's flying out of the cage.

177
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:54,217
        I'm being freed.

178
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,451
    - What's with the crown?

179
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:58,353
        - Well, Alexis,

      next drag superstar.

181
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,057
    - Sasha, don't you think    
    that's a little literal?

182
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,926
      - It's not literal,       
           it's felt.

183
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:06,993
           It's meta.

184
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:09,462
         - Wow, Sasha,          
      that is really deep.

240
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,405
        - We all agreed         
     to be very diplomatic

241
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,274
       with the selection       
  of the Village People look.

242
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,210
       I end up choosing        
     the leather biker look

243
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,811
    because it's all black,

244
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,746
    and everybody looks good    
         in all black.

245
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:49,751
             - Aah!

00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:53,254

    Hits too close to home.

247
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:54,989
    - I chose the cop look.

248
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:56,957
      I'm trying to, like,      
    let loose a little bit,

249
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,491
   be a little bit more edgy.

250
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:00,292
        So, Peppermint,         
      what are you making?

251
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:01,326
       - I'm just trying        
           to go for

252
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:04,195
             a very             
    hyper-feminized version

253
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,297
  of the leather daddy/mommy.

254
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,166
    - Pepper, are you going     
    for like a fetishy look?

255
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:11,034
     - I don't really have      
        much experience

256
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,435
  with the leather community.

257
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,737
         I'm more like          
    the pleather community.

    has a great personality.

260
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,909
  She has a great personality.

261
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,612
         But her looks,         
   they're just not polished,

262
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,146
        so that could be        
         her downfall.

263
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,148
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

264
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,482
      What do you think is      
going to be your winning ticket?

265
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:34,250
      - I can always count      
         on my smarts.

266
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,886
      - I want to do like       
    a patchwork, big skirt--

267
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,587
       - Wait. Let me put       
         my earring on.

268
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,323
           - Uh-huh.

269
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,425
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

270
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,464
         - For today's          
        maxi challenge,

271
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:57,067
      we're getting ready       
   for the gayest ball ever.

272
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,469
    I'm gonna shit glitter.

273
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:01,704
           - I chose            
      the Native American.

274
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:02,971
    I want to give something

275
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,139
         that will feel         
      a little bit tribal,

276
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,207
    but also ready to wear.

277
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,543
    What I need to use is an    
 editing eye in this challenge

278
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,344
          to make sure          
      that it feels fresh.

279
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:15,013
       This is my chance        
         to say, like,

280
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,181
         I'm not basic,         
         I have taste.

281
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:22,351
     - Alexis needs to push     
     her aesthetic further.

282
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:24,553
   She needs to modernize it.

283
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:26,354
          I feel like           
     I could go to New York

284
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,356
       and throw a stone        
   and hit five other queens

285
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:30,957
          that can do           
     exactly what she does.

286
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,492
            - Hi-ee.

287
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,360
              -Hi.              
            -Hello.

288
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,228
     - I'm here. I'm queer.

289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,429
        Get used to it.

290
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,064
     [cheers and laughter]

291
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,565
          -Hey, Sasha.          
          -Hi, RuPaul.

292
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,199
  - Now, you chose the cowboy?

293
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,901
    - Yeah, the cowboy seems    
  like a winning choice to me,

294
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,003
        and this fabric         
         is incredible.

295
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,572
        But constructing        
   is not my strongest suit,

296
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:52,940
        so I have to be         
       very, very clever.

297
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:56,943
   - Yeah. What do you think    
  is gonna be your trump card?

298
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:59,078
         Oh, did I say          
          fuck Trump?

299
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,113
          - Not today.

300
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:02,581
        - Not on the day.

301
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,949
          - Not today.

302
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,450
- What do you think is gonna be 
      your winning ticket?

303
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,618
      - I can always count      
          on my smarts

304
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,819
   to push me over the edge.

305
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,720
        - So how are you        
      going to reinterpret

306
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:11,954
       the rainbow flag?

307
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,755
      - Well, it really is      
       quite a challenge,

308
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,022
            because             
     I'm breaking it apart.

309
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,890
       I'm deconstructing       
         the rainbow--

310
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,625
        God, that sounds        
      overly intellectual,

311
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,493
      but I promise I have      
      an interesting trick

312
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:23,295
       up my sleeve that        
    I'm excited to pull out.

313
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:26,164
            - Sasha             
    is really, really, deep

314
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,000
   and puts a lot of thought    
         into her drag,

315
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,735
           and that's           
       both an advantage,

316
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,169
         but it's also          
    kind of a disadvantage.

317
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,437
     'Cause if nobody knows     
   what the hell is going on,

318
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,138
        what difference         
      does it make anyway?

319
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,939
            - Whoo.

320
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,974
       - Alexis Michelle.

321
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,542
         - Hi, RuPaul.

322
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,710
   - Now, which character in    
  the Village People are you--

323
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,278
         - Wait. Let me         
       put my earring on.

324
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,648
       Maybe you'll have        
 some sense of what I'm doing.

325
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,815
         Am I the cop?

326
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,750
           - I think            
  you're the Native American.

327
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:52,817
   - I'm the Native American.

328
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,051
     - And why'd you choose     
           that one?

329
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,919
       - I saw this bowl

330
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:59,656
       of these beautiful       
   turquoise embellishments,

331
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:02,225
      and they spoke to me      
          immediately,

332
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:03,392
   and I said, you know what?

333
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,660
  Build the look around these.

334
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,895
           - Uh-huh.

335
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:10,530
        Now, last week,         
 the judges had some critiques

336
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:11,864
     about your aesthetic.

337
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,765
             -Yes.              
   -How'd that make you feel?

338
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,868
          - You know,           
       it hurt, actually.

339
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,837
     I did sew my bodysuit      
          and leotard.

340
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,272
They weren't Halloween costumes 
      I bought in a store.

341
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,274
       - It was just that       
     the outfit you created

342
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,342
    wasn't two steps beyond.

343
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,944
        - I think I'm on        
   the right track this time,

344
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,546
         and it's time          
       to be that Phoenix

345
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:33,848
          and rise up           
      out of those ashes.

346
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,216
   - Good, because, you know,   
  we're down to the wire here.

347
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,283
          This is it.           
         - This is it.

348
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,485
    - I've chosen something     
        very ambitious,

349
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,886
   with the amount of stoning

350
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,654
      that I intend to do       
        to this bodice.

351
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,722
        Now is the time         
    I've really got to show

352
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:46,357
  that I belong here visually.

353
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,491
           -Hi, Shea.           
           -Hey, Ru.

354
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,528
        - I see lots of         
construction worker stuff here.

355
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,396
        Why'd you choose        
    the construction worker?

356
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,965
     - I'm a really big fan     
      of British fashion,

357
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,033
  you know, Vivienne Westwood,  
           Burberry.

358
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,068
      and so I want to do,      
      like, an interesting

359
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,371
     kind of like patchwork     
           big skirt

360
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,672
        that has, like,         
        a lot of, like,

361
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:05,273
     punk unfinished edges,

362
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,742
   but still really polished    
      and fashion forward.

363
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:09,944
       - Oh, my goodness.       
      That's a tall order.

364
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,245
      Now, Shea, last week

365
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,447
          you wound up          
       in the bottom two

366
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:14,815
      for the first time.

367
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,249
     Did that shake you up?

368
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:17,350
          - Oh, girl,           
        it shook me up.

369
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:19,585
       It shook me down.        
    It shook me all around.

370
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:22,154
- This challenge will determine 
        the final four,

371
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:23,155
      so this is big time.

372
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:24,489
        This is no joke.

373
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,257
          - Yeah, no.

374
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,626
         My performance         
    in last week's challenge

375
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:29,893
   was just a one time deal.

376
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:31,895
       Ain't no slip-ups        
       from here on out.

377
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:35,231
     - All right, ladykins,     
         gather round.

378
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,934
   Now, tomorrow, in addition   
   to your three ball looks,

379
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:41,636
     I want you to perform      
       an opening number

380
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:46,873
      that pays tribute to      
the gayest Olympic sport ever...

381
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,942
      rhythmic gymnastics.

382
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:53,645
     [cheers and laughter]

383
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,717
      [cheers and screams]

384
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,252
         And that's how         
     you get the gold medal

385
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,588
      here at "Drag Race."      
           [cheering]

386
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,158
       Now, Sasha Velour,       
    you won the bitch fest,

387
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,527
      so you're in charge       
      of the choreography.

388
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,962
        - Okay. [laughs]

389
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:18,032
        - So good luck,         
     and don't fuck it up.

390
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,201
     [cheers and laughter]

391
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:23,136
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

392
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,403
             - Ow!

393
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,171
         - Oh, my God.          
       Are you all right?

394
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:27,238
           - Sasha's            
   certainly not delivering.

395
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,940
         This rehearsal         
    feels kind of unfocused.

396
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:30,941
       - Crack the whip.

397
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:32,575
     - I have been trying.

398
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:33,576
            - Wham!

399
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,711
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

400
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,481
            - Whoo!

401
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,650
    - [laughs] Now it's time    
       for us to rehearse

402
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,019
    our rhythmic gymnastics     
            routine.

403
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,021
      - All right, ladies,      
       let's get to work.

404
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:53,124
   - I still don't even know    
  what rhythmic gymnastics is,

405
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,458
    but I'm gonna find out.

406
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,892
    - One thing that I loved

407
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:58,194
  that I saw the Olympians do

408
00:15:58,196 --> 00:15:59,762
           is, like,            
   they hold out these things

409
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,064
         so we can have         
    that pull apart moment.

410
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,098
          - Yes. So...

411
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,033
    - One, two, three, four.

412
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,368
   - Five, six, seven, eight.

413
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,002
    - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,269
     - This is ridiculous.

415
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,070
         - Okay, okay,          
   let's focus, let's focus.

416
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,371
      - One, two, three--

417
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,005
      - No, wait, Trinity.

418
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,107
   - One, two, three, four--

419
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,374
             - Ow!

420
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,541
         - Oh, my God.          
       Are you all right?

421
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,242
         - Oh, my God.

422
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,143
           Is it red?           
         - No, not yet.

423
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:26,446
- Bitches getting their ribbons 
         tied in knots,

424
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:28,047
  getting slapped in the face.

425
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,015
         It's actually          
    not as easy as it looks.

426
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:32,884
         - Okay, okay,          
  so going from the beginning,

427
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,452
      I come up on three,       
     and then all together

428
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:36,153
        we do something         
        on four, right?

429
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:38,221
            - Yeah.             
   And for the next section,

430
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,890
           can we do            
    five, six, seven, eight?

431
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,625
         - No. What if          
     the first time--okay.

432
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,794
   So what if the first time    
  we put Alexis in the middle?

433
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,929
      - Sasha's certainly       
        not delivering.

434
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,264
         This rehearsal         
    feels kind of unfocused.

435
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:51,999
   I grew up in the theater.

436
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,201
      I know what it means      
   to stage a musical number,

437
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:56,536
    so I have a perspective

438
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:57,703
        that could help         
       the team out here.

439
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:59,304
           Can I make           
     a suggestion, ladies?

440
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:02,540
    What do you think about     
       storm the judges,

441
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,408
        give good face?

442
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,176
        - I'd rather not        
     let it down, actually.

443
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,977
    I think it'll be sloppy     
         picking it up.

444
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:10,612
       I want to keep it        
     as simple as possible.

445
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,014
 - Are you guys all comfortable 
    with, like, a battement?

446
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,248
     So if we were like...

447
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,317
         ♪ Let it rise          
        with attitude ♪

448
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,518
             -Okay.             
        -Shea and Sasha

449
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,087
     think that their ideas     
         are the best.

450
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,455
        My point of view        
      is just pushed aside

451
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,989
        as second rate.

452
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:27,092
    May I suggest that we do    
     figure eights in place

453
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,394
     for one, two, three--

454
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,828
  - Well, that's gonna change   
        how we get off.

455
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,130
         - Well, maybe          
    if we just move faster.

456
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,965
         [all talking]

457
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:35,999
     - I don't want to move     
          any faster.

458
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,767
          - I do like           
      adding the movement.

459
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,236
     - All right, you guys.     
    We need to just decide.

460
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,705
   - There's too many chiefs    
    and not enough Indians.

461
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:43,739
        Crack the whip.

462
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,107
     - I have been trying.

463
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,209
      - Sasha's too nice,

464
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,777
      'cause I would have       
   bitched slapped somebody.

465
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,546
             Wham!              
  And then twirled my ribbon.

466
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:55,415
      - And back to work.

467
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:58,784
        - Motherfucker.

468
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,787
    - How's everybody's look    
         coming along?

469
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,089
        -It's horrible!         
           -[laughs]

470
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,890
   - I am fucking terrified.

471
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:08,425
           - Sasha's            
      rainbow runway look,

472
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:10,393
     it's very pedestrian.

473
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:13,629
      - I'm doing the most      
 time consuming part right now.

474
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,632
    It's going to be, like,     
 a patchwork on, like, flannel.

475
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,434
  - So you're making a costume  
       for Adore Delano?

476
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,302
             -Ooh.              
           -[laughs]

477
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:22,803
    - I didn't know she was     
  part of the Village People,

478
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:24,237
           but okay.

479
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,372
     - Well, no, she wasn't     
 a part of the Village People,

480
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,240
     but she was top three,     
          unlike you.

481
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,709
       - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

482
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,411
    - I'm just not impressed    
            by Shea.

483
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,513
         Cut-off shorts         
   and a wife beater? Really?

484
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,414
       Does it look like        
     a construction worker?

485
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,882
           Bitch, no.

486
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,419
       So how do you feel       
   about the routine, Sasha?

487
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,421
        - I feel, um...

488
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,655
     I feel good about it.

489
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:49,157
  These are very fun to watch,

490
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,025
     these spinning ribbons.

491
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:52,860
      - If you're a kitty.

492
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,129
     - Even if you're not.

493
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:59,532
      - I'm glad it wasn't      
    any longer than it was.

494
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,967
      - Ru better give us       
          sunglasses,

495
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,069
      'cause it's getting       
    hella shady up in here.

496
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,470
          - Honestly--

497
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,138
            - Uh-oh.            
        Get ready, girl.

498
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,006
         - I think that         
       the dance element

499
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,774
   is not your comfort zone,

500
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,043
   and I saw your insecurity    
          around that,

501
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,445
  and it came out a little bit  
       in your behavior.

502
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:19,114
        - I don't think

503
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,816
      that I was insecure       
    in the rehearsal at all.

504
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,685
         To be honest,          
  I was not being listened to.

505
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,520
  - I don't think you stood up  
      as a leader, though.

506
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:30,156
    - In my opinion, she was    
   trying to steer the ship,

507
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,057
         and all of us          
were just, like, blah-blah-blah.

508
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,626
      - I did not feel you      
       steering the ship.

509
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:36,394
          - It's clear          
        that my strategy

510
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,329
     did not work for you,

 I think of medieval tapestry,

640
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,375
      and I'm just selling      
      that fantasy beast.

641
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,909
     - The tip of her horn      
          is bleeding.

642
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,777
        I think this is

   Now, she's a real hoofer.

646
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,518
       - I am a glittery,       
         gold unicorn.

647
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,886
     Look at these hooves.

648

     You know what they say     
  about big hooves, don't you?

649
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:16,124
   - Now, that's what I call    
          a fairytale.

650
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:19,093
         - She's really         
       feeling her oats.

       - My sexy unicorn        
      is a space unicorn.

660
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:44,813
       I start to realize       
        that my garment

661
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:46,648
       is a little baggy        
        in some places,

662
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,451
   so I have to kind of move    
      very strategically.

663
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,554
  - Unicorn? I don't remember

670
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,840
    I got my hair wrapped up

00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,492
         - Your rainbow         
    was not rainbow at all,

709
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:05,560
    but it was so stunning.

710
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:07,295
         - I just felt          
 coming out in rainbow stripes

711
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:08,696
  would have been predictable.

712
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:10,097
   - Right, but there wasn't

713
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,133
    one color of the rainbow    
       in there. Not one.

714
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:15,368
  - This particular look that   
   you're wearing right now,

715
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,502
      I think it's great.

      I love the details.

717
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:19,370
          But for me,           
       the crowning glory

718
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:23,073
       is that patchwork        
   flannel shirt/cape combo.

719
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:27,577
 - Gives, like, a street style  
 model off-duty meets couture,

720
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,778
          and I would           
       totally wear that,

721
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,047
           so I hope            
    we share the same size.

722
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,281
   - Can we see that jacket?

723
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:35,149
  Can you spin around for us?

724
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:36,216

             -Yes.

726

    - Up next, Sasha Velour.

730
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,624
       - Let's start with       
   your rhythmic gymnastics.

731
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,728
     You had this psychotic     
  Dorothy Hamill feel to you.

732
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,230
     You had this plastered     
   weird smile on your face.

733
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,898
    It was really well done.

734
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,268
- I'm a little bit in love with 
 you in general, I have to say.

735
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,005
  There's something extremely   
    modern about your style.

736
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,641
      - This cowboy look,       
 the details here are so great.

737
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,542
          Super chic.           
        - Your unicorn.

738
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:10,111
  It was executed flawlessly.

739
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:13,314
    - And your rainbow look,    
I loved when you removed the hat

740
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,015
        and you gave us         
   Little House On The Fairy.

741
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:17,150
       That was amazing.

742
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:20,520
  - Up next, Alexis Michelle.

743
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:22,455
      - The gold unicorn,       
       I really liked it.

744
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:24,056
      There was something       
    very childlike about it.

745
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:26,491
       - For the rainbow,       
   I feel it was too literal.

746
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:27,725
   If they give you a theme,

747
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:30,394
       you should be able       
  to take me there, you know.

748
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,396
   And I felt like it needed    
 a little bit more of a oomph.

749
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,532
          And you look          
     incredibly beautiful,

750
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,534
     but I feel if we take      
   the bow out of your head,

751
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:39,435
     I can get that outfit      
          at Ricky's.

752
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:40,736
       It's a little bit        
          lackluster.

753
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:43,672
   - I would love to see this   
    taken way over the top.

754
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:45,740
           These two,           
     they're taking an idea

755
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,974
   and giving it a real twist

756
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:49,476
   and just going balls deep,   
          if you will.

757
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:50,777
   - This is the final five,

758
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,578
    and there's so much more    
   that could have been done.

759
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,980
     - I nearly went blind      
      stoning this thing.

760
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:56,581
           - Got it.

761
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,582
      Still underwhelming.

762
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:59,350
            - Okay.

763
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,919
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.

764
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:04,221
      - The rainbow look.       
    Does it look good? Yeah.

765
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:05,655
         Is it the best         
       you could do? No.

766
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:08,891
       This is more like        
   bar Trinity back at home.

767
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,959
       - Let's talk about       
   this runway look tonight.

768
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:13,594
    I think this is so chic     
       and so glamorous,

769
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:16,763
 and all of those little badges 
    and pins are phenomenal.

770
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,966
     The hair, the makeup,      
  the visor, it's really cool.

771
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,067
         - It's tough.

772
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,536
       At the same time,        
         it's feminine.

773
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:26,005
     The ass looks amazing.     
            [laughs]

774
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,107
     I need to take myself      
     to the gym after this.

775
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,541
     - No, just the doctor.

776
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:32,377
          [all laugh]

777
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,212
     - Up next, Peppermint.

778
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:35,880
        - Your unicorn,         
         that was fun,

779
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:38,148
         but there was          
  a little bagginess going on

780
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,149
     in the crotch-al area.

781
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:42,485
  - The rainbow I really loved

782
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:43,853
     because it was kind of     
          French diva.

783
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,455
     I had an instant flash     
       of being in Paris,

784
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:48,957
    and I wanted to meet you    
     in the park at night.

785
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,525
          [all laugh]

786
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:52,760
       - What did you do        
       in France, Andie?

787
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:54,294
          - In Paris.

788
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:58,064
      Just call me anytime      
 you're going to parties, okay?

789
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,366
- And then, this look, you know,
    the silhouette is great.

790
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:01,967
    I love all the details.

791
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,635
   - As soon as you came out    
the runway, like, you owned it.

792
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:05,269
        And I felt like         
   you were gonna beat me up,

793
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,070
         but I loved it         
       at the same time.

794
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,172
         It was, like,          
  I just loved the whole idea.

795
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,439
          - Thank you.

796
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:14,276
- Ladies, at this crucial point 
      in the competition,

797
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,881
  I have to ask, who deserves   
  to go home tonight and why?

798
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:22,183
          Let's start           
       with Shea Coulee.

799
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,818
     - I would have to say      
        Alexis Michelle.

800
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,519
        - Sasha Velour.

801
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,154
            - Alexis            
      did really struggle.

802
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:31,289
   I would have to say Alexis   
            as well.

803
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,458
    - Very interesting that     
     they're not supportive

804
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,893
      of my look right now      
    in front of the judges,

805
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,895
      considering they had      
      nothing to say to me

806
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,129
   about it in the workroom.

807
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,797
     Fucking shady whores.

808
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,432
          - All right.          
        Alexis Michelle.

809
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:47,334
           - Frankly,           
  I'd have to say Peppermint.

810
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:50,437
   She has a one-in-a-million   
          personality,

811
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:53,339
  and I think that she's able   
         to sell looks

812
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:56,475
  that aren't always finished.

813
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:58,176
       - Trinity Taylor,        
         same question.

814
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,111
   - A huge pet peeve of mine

815
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:03,514
    is not paying attention     
          to details,

816
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:06,783
     so I would have to say     
          Peppermint.

817
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:09,619
    - All right, Peppermint.    
           Your turn.

818
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:14,122
       - Probably because       
 she is my biggest competition,

819
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,923
        Trinity Taylor.

820
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,658
   - Well, thank you, ladies.

821
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,759
  I think we've heard enough.

822
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:22,728
  While you untuck backstage,

823
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,429
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

824
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:27,765
   All right. So just between   
      us squirrel friends,

825
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:29,700
       what do you think?       
 Let's start with Shea Coulee.

826
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:32,302
           - Overall,           
   I love everything she did.

827
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:33,703
          The unicorn           
       was very powerful.

828
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,905
    - Construction couture,     
            amazing.

829
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,273
      One of my favorites.

830
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:40,909
- Her rainbow look did not read 
   rainbow to me whatsoever.

831
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,644
   - I could see in the movie   
      "Paris Is Burning,"

832
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:44,045
  people would be on the floor  
           shouting,

833
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,414
   it is not a rainbow dress!

834
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,949
            - I get             
    what everyone is saying,

835
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,285
       but the fact that        
she included makeup on her body,

836
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:54,620
    it was like an artwork.

837
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,989
         - Shea Coulee          
     came here to compete,

838
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,890
  and she knows how to do it.

839
00:32:58,892 --> 00:33:00,791
         Sasha Velour.

840
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:03,026
     - I love Sasha because     
    I think she's original.

841
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,495
     - She gave us rainbow      
   in a really different way,

842
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:08,231
      and the unicorn look      
    stood out from the herd.

843
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,332
          [all laugh]

844
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,801
          I just think          
      she's chic as fuck.

845
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,069
       - Her cowboy look        
   was absolutely beautiful,

846
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,971
    but it was more fashion     
       than it was drag.

847
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:18,939
         - Yeah, I come         
     to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

848
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:21,841
  not just to see a look that   
    I'm going to go to Paris

849
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:23,375
       and I can see that       
         down a runway.

850
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,010
      Like, I just needed       
   to be taken to that dream,

851
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:27,144
       that fantasy land.

852
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:28,512
     - You know, I'm torn,

853
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:31,381
  because everything Sasha did  
   was absolutely fantastic.

854
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:34,717
      But is it gag-worthy      
          for a ball?

855
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,351
         We're looking          
    for the Harlem children

856
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:38,653
  to be saying, you are over.

857
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:41,322
         You are over.          
   Miss Thing, you are over.

858
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:43,324
        Alexis Michelle.

859
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:44,558
   - Her rhythmic gymnastics    
             thing,

860
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,660
      she just had so much      
       enthusiasm for it

861
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:50,263
      and she gave us like      
 Mary Lou Retton 1986 realness.

862
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,764
   - Every time she came out    
         on the stage,

863
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:54,399
    I was just so captivated    
         by her beauty.

864
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:56,701
      But everything else       
   kind of like fell through.

865
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,602
 - To me, that Native American  
     fell completely short.

866
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,869
         So many things         
      she could have done

867
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,838
   to make it so much better    
     and so much draggier.

868
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,473
   And it looked like a shake   
and go that she had on tonight.

869
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,308
         - The look was         
    a little bit pedestrian.

870
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,178
- Again, we have to look at this
    as this is the top five

871
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,146
   and this is when you bring   
    the best that you have.

872
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:14,213
             - Yes.

873
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:16,215
       - Trinity Taylor.

874
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,951
      - The rainbow look,       
  that was a real miss for me.

875
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:20,185
      We need wow factor.

876
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:22,120
        I want that look        
        to be an event,

877
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:23,888
       and that was like        
         an appetizer.

878
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,856
       - And the unicorn,       
     it wasn't my favorite,

879
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,290
      but I still thought       
      it was a lot of fun.

880
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,159
   - Even though her unicorn    
      wasn't that special,

881
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,793
       she sold the fuck        
       out of that thing.

882
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,561
        - Yeah, she did.

883
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:36,030
   - Her final look, however,   
       was so fantastic.

884
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,531
      Everything about it,      
         from the hair

885
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,533
       down to the bottom       
      just worked for me.

886
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,668
        - Pep, Pep, Pep.        
     What's up, Peppermint?

887
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,802
        - I don't think         
      she was a stand out

888
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:45,070
   in the rhythmic gymnastics   
            number.

889
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:47,072
   I didn't notice if she did   
   a great job or a bad job.

890
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,940
     I just didn't notice.      
       That's a problem.

891
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:51,175
  - Her unicorn was definitely  
    out of her comfort zone.

892
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:53,577
  She had a "Hellraiser" thing

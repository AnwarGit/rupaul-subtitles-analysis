00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,166
IT'S NOT THAT
YOUR CLOTHES ARE UGLY.

176
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,367
IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE MISSHAPEN.

177
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,233
- OK.

178
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,367
WOW, COURTNEY.

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
YOU COULD PROBABLY GLUE DOWN
THAT LACE FRONT THERE.

180
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,867
OH! NO, THAT'S JUST
YOUR SKIN THAT'S WRINKLED.

181
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,600
- WELL, I'M THE OLDEST
LIVING TWINK IN HISTORY.

182
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,600
- WELL, YOU GOT
THAT TWINK BODY.

183
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,200
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO
A COUPLE OF SQUATS

184
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,166
TO TIGHTEN UP THAT ASS.

185
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,066
- YOU LOOK LIKE A WALLABY.

186
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
- HI, DARIENNE. HOW ARE YOU?

187
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,300
- HI. I'M DARIENNE LAKE!

188
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,433
- SO, DARIENNE, TELL ME,

189
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,834
HAVE YOU HAD A FUN TIME
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE?"

190
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,667
- I'VE HAD
A GREAT TIME, COURTNEY!

191
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,834
- WHAT'S BEEN YOUR
LEAST FAVORITE PART?

192
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,233
- HMM. PROBABLY
THE GUEST JUDGES.

193
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,233
- OH.

194
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,867
- NEIL PATRICK HARRIS HATES ME.

195
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
- OH. AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS BOYFRIEND?

196
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:42,300
- I TOLD HIM HE COULD USE $1.50
TO GO RIDE THE BUS.

197
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,467
- I'M FINDING IT REALLY HARD
TO MAKE YOU FUNNY, DARIENNE.

198
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,667
IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE.

199
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
- I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE INTERNET FOR SOME JOKES.

200
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,500
I DON'T HAVE ANY WI-FI HERE,

201
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:56,300
SO I'M FINDING IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO BE FUNNY.

202
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,633
- HI THERE, BIANCA.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

203
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,500
- TERRIBLE. THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES!

204
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,367
- OH. WELL, BIANCA,
WHAT A THING TO SAY!

205
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,500
- BALONEY!

206
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,500
- NOW, BIANCA, YOUR DRESS
LOOKS GORGEOUS TODAY.

207
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,867
- WELL, THANK GOODNESS,

208
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,567
BECAUSE I HAVE 50 OF THE SAME
DRESS IN DIFFERENT FABRICS.

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,333
- BIANCA, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

210
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,233
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FEELING
IN THIS COMPETITION.

211
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,367
- ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE
IDIOTS AND ASSHOLES.

212
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
ADORE'S AN IDIOT.
DELA'S GOT A STUPID VOICE.

213
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,967
SANTINO'S ASSHOLE IS LOOSE.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,533
- OH, BIANCA, PET.

215
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,667
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LACE FRONT
IS COMING OFF.

216
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,934
- BALONEY.
I HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

217
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:35,000
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
I WORK ALL THE TIME.

218
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,567
BALONEY. AAH!

219
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
ASSHOLES! AAH!

220
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,700

- YEAH!

224
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,467
I KNEW IF I HITCHED
MYSELF TO THIS WAGON,

225
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,066
IT WOULD PULL ME SOMEWHERE.

226
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
- BALONEY!

00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,266

00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,633
ROSE QUARTZ?

251
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,633
I THINK I WENT TO
HEBREW SCHOOL WITH HER.

252
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,433

00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,834
- WE HAVE TO
COME UP WITH 3 LOOKS.

255
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,400
ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE
FROM SCRATCH,

256
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,100
AND WE'VE GOT LIKE
A DAY TO DO IT.

257
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,400
- COMING UP...

258
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,734

[GROANS]

260
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,233
- I JUST GET REALLY, LIKE,

261
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,800
DISCOURAGED AND,
LIKE, FRUSTRATED.

262
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:21,800
[ENGINE REVS]

263
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,900

264
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,066
- COME ON, DIAMOND.

265
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,266
OH!

266
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,800
- FOR TODAY'S MAIN CHALLENGE,

267
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,200
WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
THE "ALL THAT GLITTERS" BALL.

268
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,033
WE NEED TO CREATE
3 DISTINCT LOOKS:

269
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,166
BANJEE GIRL BLING,

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,467
PLATINUM CARD
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,

271
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,233
AND DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA
IN OUR DESIGNATED JEWEL TONE.

272
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,600
- [GROANS]

273
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,600
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

274
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,300
- I'M JUST HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.

275
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,834
IN THE PAST, WE'VE HAD TO CREATE
ONE LOOK FOR THE RUNWAY,

276
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,400
BUT THIS IS 3 SEPARATE LOOKS.

277
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:59,734
EVERYBODY IS PRETTY WORRIED
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE

278
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,633
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
BIANCA DEL RIO.

279
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,166
- I LIKE THIS TO START WITH.

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
- SHE'S KIND OF THE MARKER
YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT.

281
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,533
BECAUSE SHE HAS
THE SEWING SKILLS,

282
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,600
SHE CAN JUST BANG
THINGS OUT A LOT FASTER

283
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,700
THAN THE REST OF US CAN.

284
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,433
- THAT'S PRETTY.
- YEAH.

285
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,066
- FUCK OFF.

286
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,266
- SO WAIT A MINUTE.

287
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,333
WHAT MADE YOU PICK ME
AS SAPPHIRE?

288
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,200
- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
ANY OF THE COLORS

289
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,700
WERE POSITIVES OR NEGATIVES.

290
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,233
I THOUGHT THE ONLY ONE
THAT WAS, LIKE,

291
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,467
SORT OF ESPECIALLY EASY
WAS DIAMONDS,

292
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
WHICH IS WHY
I THREW IT TO ADORE.

293
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,433
- REALLY?

294
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,033
WHY NOT JUST GIVE HER
CEMENT SHOES

295
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,133
AND THROW HER IN THE WATER

296
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,233
AND GIVE HER SOMETHING
REALLY ROUGH?

297
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,600
- BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT A EVIL CUNT.

298
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,300
- I MEAN, THIS IS A COMPETITION.

299
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,166
- SO, BITCH?

300
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,900
I WOULDN'T THROW YOU
UNDER THE DAMN OCEAN.

301
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,166
ONLY AN INSECURE BITCH
WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

302
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,500
IT IS A COMPETITION,

303
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,467
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SABOTAGE
ANYBODY ON THE WAY THERE.

304
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,333
- AM I BEING HATEFUL
BY SAYING THAT?

305
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,867
- NO, YOU'RE BEING REAL.

306
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,166
- AND THAT'S WHAT
I AM, A-REAL.

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,066
- AND YOUR REAL SELF
IS HATEFUL.

308
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,400
- ROWR.

309
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,834
- PEOPLE SAY THAT
I'M BEING MEAN,

310
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:09,834
BUT I'M IN THIS FOR
A CROWN AND $100,000.

311
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:13,400
YOU HELP YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU HELP OTHERS.

312
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,967
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,700
- HELLO.

314
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,333
- HOW ARE THINGS
IN THE JEWELRIES DISTRICT?

315
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,567
- STONED.

316
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,867
- [LAUGHTER]

317
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,400
- ADORE DELANO.

318
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,433
- HI, RU.

319
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,767
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT

320
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,266
FOR YOUR DRIPPING
IN JEWELS ELEGANZA?

321
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,700
- I WAS THINKING OF JUST, LIKE,
BEJEWELING THE HELL OUT OF THIS,

322
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,166
BUT I WANT--I DON'T KNOW.

323
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,000
I HAVE, LIKE, SO MANY IDEAS,
AND THAT'S THE THING.

324
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,734
LIKE, I THINK, LIKE,
OF SO MANY THINGS,

325
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,834
AND I JUST REALLY WANT
TO GET IT, LIKE, DONE.

326
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,700
- WHAT CAN YOU SHOW THE JUDGES

327
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:43,700
TO LET THEM KNOW THAT
YOU ARE TOP-3 MATERIAL?

328
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,500
- I JUST THINK, LIKE,

329
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,333
WHAT I HAD IN THE
BEGINNING OR WHATEVER,

330
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,200
LIKE, IT KIND OF GOT LOST.

331
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,934
I JUST GET REALLY,
LIKE, DISCOURAGED

332
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,500
AND, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.

333
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,266
I DON'T WANT TO BE, LIKE,
THE CHIONA, LIKE,

334
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,467
THAT CRIES ALL THE TIME,

335
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,834
BUT IT JUST PISSES ME OFF

336
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,100
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SO
TALENTED, LIKE, IN OTHER THINGS,

337
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:13,100
SO I'M JUST, "WHY CAN'T,
LIKE, MY BRAIN, LIKE,

338
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,066
ALLOW ME TO MAKE
A FUCKING DRESS?"

339
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,300
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

340
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,767
- IT'S LIKE, I DON'T
WANT TO LIP-SYNC AGAIN.

341
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,734
I CAME HERE TO BE, LIKE, TOP 3
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.

342
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,000
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

343
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,633
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE NOTES
THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU A LOT

344
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:27,300
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
APPLY YOUR GREAT THINGS,

345

00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:39,734
- [LAUGHTER]

685
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,533
- DARIENNE LAKE IN TOPAZ.

686
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,800
BRONZE GODDESS.

687
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:48,600
- I AM GIVING YOU A TOUCH
OF SLAVE PRINCESS LEIA.

688
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:51,900
- GLAMOUR FROM
HEAD TO TOPAZ.

689
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:53,800
COURTNEY ACT IN RUBIES.

690
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:54,900
- WORK IT, HONEY.

691
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,533
- RED ALERT.

692
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,100
- I'M COVERED FROM
NOSE TO LACE FRONT

693
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,834
IN RED SPARKLING GLITTER.

694
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,333
- RED, FULFILLED.

695
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,834
- ♪ NOW SISSY THAT WALK ♪

696
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:08,333
- WELCOME, MY PRECIOUS JEWELS.

697
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:11,367
IT'S TIME FOR
THE JUDGES' APPRAISALS.

698
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,633
FIRST UP, BENDELACREME.

699
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,233
- I WAS CONFUSED
BY YOUR BANJEE GIRL.

700
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,567
I LOVED THE OUTFIT.

701
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,633
I'M INTO, LIKE,
HOOCHIE-MAMA IT UP.

702
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,233
I JUST DID NOT GET
THE TULLE.

703
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,200
IT WAS MORE DISTRACTING
THAN ANYTHING.

704
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,000
- AS FAR AS YOUR
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,

705
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,367
THAT'S THE ONE
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH.

706
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,667
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

707
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,500
YOU'RE GONNA RUN ANY BUSINESS
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

708
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,800
IT WAS A COCKTAIL DRESS.

709
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,100
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN IT,

710
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,433
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CATEGORY WAS.

711
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,166
- I'M ALWAYS HOPING
THAT YOU SURPRISE ME,

712
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,233
AND THIS WEEK,
YOU DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT.

713
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:45,400
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO,
DRIPPING IN DIAMONDS.

714
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,166
- FRIGGING ADORE.

715
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,300
- HI.

716
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,300
- FOR REAL?

717
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,433
- WHAT?

718
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:54,967
- YOU MADE ME SO HAPPY TONIGHT.
I COULD KISS YOU!

719
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,734
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE WE GONNA TONGUE?

720
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,734
- KIDS, THAT WAS HOW YOU DO
A BANJEE GIRL LOOK.

721
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:02,867
YOU KILLED IT.

722
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,800
- PHENOMENAL.
LOVE THE ATTITUDE.

723
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,233
I WOULD WEAR THOSE BOOTS
AND NOTHING ELSE.

724
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,734
- I DO. I VACUUM IN THEM.

725
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,266
- HONEY, I WOULD, TOO.

726
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,867
- THIS GOOFY THING
YOU HAVE ON NOW IS JUST PERFECT.

727
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,834
YOUR WIG AND YOUR SKIRT
ARE LIKE SISTERS.

728
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,633
THEY LOOK
THE SAME SHAPE EXACTLY.

729
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,300
I JUST LOVED THE WHOLE THING.
IT MADE ME REALLY LAUGH.

730
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,767
- SO DURING THE WALKTHROUGH,

731
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
YOU HAD AN EMOTIONAL
BREAKTHROUGH,

732
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,266
AND IT SHOWED ONSTAGE.

733
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,367
- WELL, THE THING IS,

734
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,700
I HAD AN EPIPHANY
WHEN I WAS TAKING A BATHTUB.

735
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,500
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

736
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:32,567
LIKE, NO MORE CHIONA SHIT.
YOU'RE IN SEASON 6."

737
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,533
- RIGHT.

738
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,734
- "IT'S GAME TIME."

739
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,800
FUCKING PARTY.
I'M EXCITED.

740
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:40,700
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
BIANCA DEL RIO IN SAPPHIRE.

741
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,400
- THAT'S A GOOD DRAG NAME.

742
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:43,767
SAPPHIRE!

743
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,433
- I LIKE YOUR
EXECUTIVE OUTFIT.

744
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,900
I'VE KNOWN THAT WOMAN.
SHE'S REALLY ALL BUSINESS.

745
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,367
BUT THIS LAST ONE LOOKS, TO ME,
LIKE A BAR MITZVAH MOTHER.

746
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,700
I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE OFF

747
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,800
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE
RUFFLED THINGS.

748
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,500
- LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
YOU DID A SIMILAR SILHOUETTE

749
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,600
TO THE DRESS THAT
YOU'RE WEARING NOW.

750
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,700
I WISH I COULD SEE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

751
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:06,734
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE IN TOPAZ.

752
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:07,934
- THE BANJEE GIRL.

753
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,066
- WHAT?

754
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,533
- DARIENNE,
THAT WAS MORE RAVE.

755
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,367
LIKE, THERE WAS
NOTHING STREET TO ME.

756
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,367
EXECUTIVE REALNESS--
DIDN'T BUY THAT EITHER.

757
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,166
WHERE? JIFFY LUBE?

758
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,600
NOW, THIS LOOK--THAT TOPAZ COLOR
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.

759
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,734
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME
IS THAT IT'S DROOPY.

760
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,367
- THOSE JEWELS ARE HEAVY.

761
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,266
- AND YOUR FABRIC
IS STRETCHING.

762
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,600
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

763
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,266
- I WAS GOING FOR THAT SORT OF
SLAVE PRINCESS LEIA THING,

764
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,934
BUT I ENDED UP LOOKING MORE LIKE
IF HER AND JABBA HAD A BABY.

765
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,767
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BECAUSE THE CONCEPT IS THERE,

766
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,934
BUT IT WAS JUST NOT A VERY
SUCCESSFUL SET OF LOOKS

767
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,533
THAT WE SAW FROM YOU TONIGHT.

768
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:49,033
- NEXT UP,
COURTNEY ACT IN RUBIES.

769
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:52,066
- YOUR BANJEE GIRL--
TO ME, NOT BANJEE.

770
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,333
WHAT WE GOT WAS, LIKE,

771
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,300
"ROCKER CHICK WEARING MY
BOYFRIEND'S FLANNEL SHIRT."

772
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,266
- I HAD GOLD BAMBOO
HOOP EARRINGS, MICHELLE.

773
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,166
- GIRL, BAMBOO EARRINGS
DOES NOT A BANJEE GIRL MAKE,

774
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,700
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA SHIMMY
AND SHOW US YOUR CAKES,

775
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,233
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CAKES.

776
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:05,467
- THERE WAS PADS IN THERE.

777
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,400
- GIRL, IT WAS SO SMALL.
YOU NEED TO PAD MORE.

778
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,567
- OK.

779
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,467
- GO ROB A COUCH.

780
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,433
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE
OF THE ELEGANZA LOOKS.

781
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:17,800
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
EFFORTLESSLY CHIC GOWNS

782
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,367
THAT YOU WOULD SEE
ON THE RUNWAY

783
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,667
OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT
DESIGNERS.

784
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,400
- LADIES, I HATE TO TARNISH
THIS SHINING MOMENT,

785
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,166
BUT I MUST ASK,

786
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,400
WHICH ONE OF YOU
SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT?

787
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:31,867
- OH, GOD.

788
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,967
- AND WHY?

789
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:37,467
COMING UP...

790
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,033
- SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER

791
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,467
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.

792
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,567
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.

793
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,567
[ENGINE REVS]

794
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,633
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]

795
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,533
- LADIES, I MUST ASK...

796
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:58,967
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHOULD
GO HOME TONIGHT, AND WHY?

797
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,767
LET'S START WITH DELA.

798
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
- I THINK DARIENNE.

799
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,533
EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE

800
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:08,734
HAS REALLY SHOWN AN ABILITY
TO HEAR CRITIQUE AND ADJUST,

801
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:12,066
AND SOME FOLKS, LIKE BIANCA,
JUST SAIL THROUGH,

802
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,967
BUT DARIENNE--

803
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,767
I THINK SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER

804
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,633
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.

805
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,700
- ALL RIGHT. THANKS, DELA.
ADORE DELANO.

806
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:27,400
- I FEEL, BASED ON THIS
CHALLENGE, DARIENNE.

807
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,066
- BIANCA DEL RIO.

808
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,767
- IF IT'S ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE,

809
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,967
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY DARIENNE.

810
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU.

811
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,333
- I KNOW.

812
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:35,667
- WHICH IS WHY
I'M CALLED A BITCH,

813
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,934
AND APPARENTLY
I'M SAILING NOW.

814
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,066
- IS THAT A BAD THING?

815
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,233
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.

816
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,367
- WHY IS THAT AN INSULT?

817
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,033
- I SHOULD PICK YOUR ASS
JUST FOR BEING A CUNT.

818
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,533
- THAT WAS, LIKE,
YOU'RE GOOD AT STUFF.

819
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,500
- YEAH. NO, THAT WAS
VERY CONDESCENDING.

820
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,066
- DARIENNE LAKE,
SAME QUESTION.

821
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,367
- I THINK, "DARIENNE,

822
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,700
"YOU SHOULD REALLY GO HOME
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY.

823
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,633
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,
AND REALIZE THE CRITICISMS."

824
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,266
WHO I THINK SHOULD GO HOME?

825
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,900
WHOEVER DOES NOT LIP-SYNC
FOR THEIR LIFE.

826
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,867
- OK, COURTNEY ACT.

827
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,834
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,

828
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:09,200
I EARMARKED ADORE
AS BEING TOP 3.

829
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:12,000
AND OVER
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

830
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,700
SHE'S KIND OF TRIPPED
AND STUMBLED,

831
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,533
SO I THINK THAT SHE
WOULD BE THE NEXT TO GO,

832
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,700
BUT I GUESS, BASED ON
TONIGHT'S COMMENTS,

833
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,600
I'M GONNA SAY DARIENNE.

834
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,533
- SO YOUR ANSWER IS
ADORE AND DARIENNE?

835
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,066
- [LAUGHTER]

836
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,200
- THANK YOU, LADIES.

837
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,967
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE "UNTUCKED" LOUNGE,

838
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,066
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

839
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,867
JUST BETWEEN US RHINESTONERS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

840
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,633
LET'S START WITH BENDELACREME.

841
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,834
- WELL, YOU KNOW, WITH BENDELA,

842
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,834
MY ISSUE IS,
SHE'S NOT MEMORABLE.

843
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:46,233
I TOTALLY DID NOT EVEN REALIZE
SHE WAS IN THE OPENING ACT,

844
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,500
AND I THINK HOW SHE
MAKES STUFF LOOKS CHEAP.

845
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,467
- I AGREE. MOST OF WHAT SHE WORE
WAS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL.

846
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,166
I LIKED THE ROSE
QUARTZ THE BEST,

847
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,333
AND I DIDN'T
EVEN LIKE IT.

848
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,500
IT'S LIKE AN OLD
BETTY GRABLE OUTFIT.

849
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:58,800
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS CUTE--

850
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,200
KIND OF PONY,
SHOWGIRL LOOK FOR BENDELA,

851
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:04,400
BUT SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN
MANY TIMES BEFORE.

852
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:05,767
AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME,

FROM BENDELA.

855
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,834
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S
MOVE ON DOWN TO ADORE.

856
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,000
- I LOVED ADORE.

857
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,233
ANYONE COULD WEAR AN OUTFIT.

858
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:15,400
NOT EVERYBODY COULD CARRY IT,

859
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:18,000
AND I THINK ADORE,
NO MATTER WHAT LOOK SHE DID,

860
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,600
SHE EMBODIED THAT PERSONALITY.

861
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:20,667
- I AGREE.

862
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,166
I MEAN, IT'S NOT SO MUCH
THAT HER LOOKS

863
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,033
WERE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S,

864
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,700
BUT SHE SOLD THEM TO US.

865
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:30,867
- YEAH. IT WASN'T JUST
A GIRL IN AN OUTFIT.

866
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,233
I WAS AMUSED
ALL NIGHT BY HER.

867
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:34,500
- WITH THAT SAID,

868
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,166
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD
HAVE NOTICED ADORE

869
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,834
IN THE OPENING NUMBER IF SHE
HADN'T TRIPPED EVERY TIME.

870
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,934

BOB, I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
LIKE HER SAPPHIRE DRESS MORE.

872
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,333
- NO, I DIDN'T.

873
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:48,367
IT WASN'T NEW OR INTERESTING
OR OLD-TIME GLAMOUR, EVEN.

874
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

SHE DID THIS WEEK,

876
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,266
NONE OF THEM
WERE SO OFF THE MARK,

877
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,200
AND HER EXECUTION IS
ON POINT TO HER VISION.

878
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:59,233
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DARIENNE LAKE.

879
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,100
- SHE DID A GREAT
MARILYN MONROE,

880
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,967
AND THEN WE DIDN'T
SLOWLY DESCEND.

881
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,200
WE CRASH-LANDED.

882
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:09,400
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE
WAS THINKING FOR, REALLY,

883
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,567
ANY OF THE LOOKS.

884
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,834
THE BANJEE LOOK
IS SO UNFLATTERING.

885
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:15,667
- AND THEN THE SHOES WERE JUST
THE FRIGGING CHERRY ON TOP.

886
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,567
- WHERE DID YOU BUY THEM--
THE MICHELIN MAN SHOES?

887
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,633
- THROW THEM AWAY.

888
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,200
- BUT SHE'S GOT
A GREAT ATTITUDE.

889
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,200
SHE KNEW THAT
SHE HAD MISSED THE MARK,

890
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:28,033
AND I'D RATHER THAT THAN
SOMEBODY GO LIKE, "NO,

891
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,433
EVERYTHING I DID WAS GREAT,
AND I'M PERFECT."

892
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,300
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.

893
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,100
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.

894
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,200
LIKE, THE RED OUTFIT WAS
A PRETTY PIECE OF FABRIC

IT'S COASTING NOW.

SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

899

- $100,000.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

HER ELEGANZA LOOK LOOKS,

WHATEVER I SAY, THE OPPOSITE.

907

HOW YOU REALLY
DISLIKE THAT LOOK.

I JUST THINK IT'S BASIC.

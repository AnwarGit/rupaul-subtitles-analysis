00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:05,734
- Coco Montrese.

00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:07,066
- Alyssa Edwards.

4
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,467
- The pageant
tore our friendship apart.

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,433
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later.

6
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,000
- Jinkx, on the runway,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,200
I think you should have prepared
more than one look.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,233
- Every week I've done
a different look.

9
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,233
- Bullshit.

10
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,367
Jinkx, she's all comedy

11
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,600
and no glamour.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,567
- You will be creating
your own signature fragrance.

13
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,467
- My fragrance is called
Alyssa's Secret.

14
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,800
- What is Alyssa's secret?

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
- Son of a bitch.

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,500
- Can we see your background?

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,900
- New York City.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,600
- Uh, that's Tokyo.
- Oh, is it?

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,433
- I have a crush
on Ivy Winters.

20
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,300
- [gasps]

21
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,133

Are you red-y for me?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,567

of this challenge.

24
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,333
- Ha-ha!

25
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,333
- Alyssa Edwards,
shantay, you stay.

26
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:05,600
Ivy, sashay away.

27
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,400
- Aw, Ivy Winters.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,066
- "I love you girls so much.

29
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:22,166
You always have a friend in me."

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,967
- Girl, she is
an amazing person.

31
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,467
- Yeah.
- Amazing, amazing.

32
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:30,400
Ivy and I were really connecting
and really feeling very close.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,567
And the person who's been
such a good friend to me

34
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:36,533
is now gone.

35
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,700
- Coco, now I know
what it feels like

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,066
to be in the bottom,
twice.

37
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,900
- Was it horrifying
being up there again?

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,333
- No, I'm a performer, baby.

39
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,333
This is what I do.

40
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,066
So if I have to
lip sync for my life

41
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,500
all the way to the final,
I'll do what I got to do.

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,734
- So what you're saying
to me is,

43
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,200
"Well, it doesn't matter
about the challenges.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,166
If I fall short every time,
I'll just lip sync my way back."

45
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,633
- I'm confident about
performance.

46
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,066
I'm not confident in my acting.

47
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,066
That horrible cologne commercial
and that Katy Perry and that--

48
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,767
- But those are our challenges.

49
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,767
- Listen, let me explain
something to you.

50
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:04,800
- No, you're not my mama,

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,734
don't explain nothing to me,
sweetie.

52
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,800
- Some people should just
call a spade a spade

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,066
and say,
"Hey, I like competition.

54
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:14,333
I just don't like the work
that comes along with it."

55
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,433
- Coco, you and I need to talk
about something too.

56
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,367
Something that keeps getting
said to me and to Alaska.

57
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,834
I feel like I've been labeled
as a comedy queen

58
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,734
in a belittling way, and--

59
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,133
- Oh, my God.

60
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,533
- There's a double standard
going on right now.

61
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,767
When I do well
in the challenges,

62
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,166
they just kind of
roll their eyes

63
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,900
because I don't have
their respect.

64
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,533
I am working just as hard as
anyone else here at everything.

65
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,967
- Jinkx--

66
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,567
- And to say that you're just
a comedy queen is belittling...

67
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,834
- Jinkx--

68
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,066
- Something I have made my whole
career on--I am talking.

69
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,300
It is something
I work very hard at.

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
- How many times have y'all
called us pageant queens?

71
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,233
- Jinkx, I told you the same
thing when you brung this up.

72
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,433
That you said "pageant queen."

73
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,533
- That's all I had to say.
- Oh.

74
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,800
- These pageant girls
keep telling me,

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,233
"I don't want to be a pageant
girl for the rest of my life."

76
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,066
Well, then, fucking stop
calling me the comedy queen.

77
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,967
I'm sick of that.

78
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,667

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,967
telenovela style.

180
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,233
- Son of a bitch.

181
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,266
And it's another
acting challenge.

182
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:40,767
- One script is<i> Casa de Locas.</i>

183
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,100
House of the Crazies.

184
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,533
The other,<i> Ella No es Dama.</i>

185
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,867
She's No Lady.

186
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,767
Detox and Alyssa.

187
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,667
First, you need to pick
your cast.

188
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,633
Detox.
- Roxxxy.

189
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:56,600
- Como?

190
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,734
[laughter]

191
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:58,767
- Alyssa.

192
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,066
- Jinkx.

193
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,300
- All right, Detox.

194
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,333
- You know I love you, Coco,

195
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,300
but I have to reform Rolaskatox.

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,934
- Por que?

197
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,800
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

198
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,934
[laughter]

199
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:14,233
- Uh-oh, I don't want the judges

200
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:18,633
to see me relying
on the crutch of a clique.

201
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:23,066
- So that means, Coco,
you're with Alyssa.

202
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:28,066
- After all that drama with
Coco, Jinkx, and me,

203
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,533
we're all on the same team.

204
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,934
Go team Alyssa.

205
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:36,166
- Caballeros,
start your engines.

206
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,700
And may the best<i> mujer</i><span style="bodyStyle"> win.</i>

207
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,900
[all shouting<i> el grito]</i>

208
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,233
- This is the first time that

209
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,734
members of Rolaskatox are
working together

210
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:53,500
since I sort of decided that
we should all be free agents.

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
- [Italian accent]
We are now r-r-r-rich!

212
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
- You're so Italian.

213
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,834
- Muy r-r-r-rico.

214
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,934
[both laughing]

215
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
- That was perfect.

216
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,367
- It's terrible.

217
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,066
- Sometimes Detox's
sense of humor

218
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:13,066
gets in the way of
taking the things

219
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,867
that need to be taken seriously
serious.

220
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,600
- Michelle already warned you.

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,533
Cliques can be dangerous.

222
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:24,333
That reunion of Rolaskatox might
be broken up real fast.

223
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,567
-<i> Coming up...</i>

224
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:28,600
You cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?

225
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,233
- Yes.

226
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,567
- You look beautiful, Detox.

227
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,567
- Ah!

228
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,600
- [laughing]

229
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,066
- [laughing]

230
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,066
- Oh, my God, that's sickening,
miss thing!

231
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,467
You have to use it.

232
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,200
- Today's main challenge is

233
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,300
serving up telenovela realness.

234
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,333
Oh, my God, I love it.

235
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,533
[trills]

236
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,967
- All:<i> Vaya con dios.</i>

237
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,066
- Telenovela is very loud
and in your face and dramatic.

238
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,400
-<i> Muerte.</i>

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,767
- And I am carrying his baby.

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,900
- [whispering indistinctly]

241
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,400
- Alyssa's not an actress,
but I guess like she said,

242
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,767
"I'll be bad in every challenge

243
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,600
and just get by
on the lip sync."

244
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,433
- I have the same disease!

245
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,133
I'm gonna be real drama there.

246
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,567
- You got to really, like,
bring it in,

247
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:28,333
'cause you rushing it like,
"I have the same disease!"

248
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,266
- I think Coco is definitely

249
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,633
trying to throw me off my game,

250
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:36,400
and I have to zone her out.

251
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,934
- Hola, hola, hola.

252
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,033
[overlapping greetings]

253
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,900
<i>Donde esta el drama?</i>

254
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,467
- All:<i> Aqui, aqui, aqui, aqui.</i>

255
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,700
- Hello, team Alyssa.

256
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,700
- La casa de locas.

257
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
- Yeah.

258
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,400
So what role are you playing,
Alyssa?

259
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,934
- I am playing a glamorous
woman of the house.

260
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:00,233
The ruler.
- Uh-huh.

261
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:04,400
- And Jinkx is my 18-year-old
virginal daughter.

262
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,500
So you cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?

263
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,834
- Yes.

264
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,900
- Coco, in the past,
you and Alyssa

265
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,400
have had your differences.

266
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,333
Have you guys worked through
that?

267
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,734
- No.

268
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,200
- Well, I'm just trying to gauge

269
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,066
how close you guys were
and how big this rift was.

270
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,667
- We were close.

271
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,133
- I'm thinking<i> The Turning Point</i>
with Anne Bancroft

272
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,266
and Shirley MacLaine.

273
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,166
- Let's do Tyra Banks
and Naomi Campbell.

274
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,800
- Oh, okay.

275
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,100
- Oh, I'm Tyra Banks.

276
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,567
- Can I hear a little bit of it?

277
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,567
- Mamacita, mamacita,

278
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:43,066
Pablo asked me
to mar-r-r-ry him.

279
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,133
- Wait a minute,
is she Italian or is she--

280
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,533
- Oh, is it coming off Italian?

281
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,633
- Yeah, a little bit.

282
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,133
- Have I been Italian
this whole time?

283
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,934
[laughter]

284
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,500
- If you hear the names of food,

285
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,800
you will violently orgasm.

286
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,066
Read my lines.
[laughs]

287
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,400
- You got a lot of lines
to memorize.

288
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,600
You know, we're down
to six girls now,

289
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
and the stakes are very high,
all right?

290
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
- Thank you.

291
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,767
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

292
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>Adios.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thanks, Ru.

293
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,600
- Adios.
- Team Detox.

294
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh, my goodness.
- Hi, Ru.

295
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,934
- So you're playing
the young ingenue.

296
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,700
- Yes, I am the virginal
18-year-old.

297
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,567
I think we know
why I'm a virgin.

298
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,333
[laughter]

299
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,500
- Now, Detox, you reunited
Rolaskatox.

300
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,467
- Uh-huh.
- Is that a good idea?

301
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:35,600
Could it be a little bit of
a easy crutch?

302
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,200
- We just are so full
of personality,

303
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,367
and we have a lot of fun
working together.

304
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,867
- Well, you know,
it's great to have fun,

305
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:45,100
but you also need to take
this challenge seriously.

306
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,066
Now, Alaska, what are you
worried about in this challenge?

307
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,300
- If every line is over the top,

308
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,767
then it's like, the really,
like, zinger lines lose their--

309
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,867
- I have to take this off.

310
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,300
[laughter]

311
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,100
- Now, Detox,
on the main stage,

312
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,633
the criticism you get is that
we're getting "B" plus.

313
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,066
We want "A" plus from you.

314
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,467
And I'm just interested that

315
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:11,233
you're going to take it to that
place wearing a mask.

316
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,767
- Whatchu talkin' 'bout,
Willis?

317
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,967
- This is getting down
to the wire.

318
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,333
Somebody's gonna go home.

319
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,133
And you got to make sure
it's not you.

320
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,133
- Right.
- You got a lot of work to do.

321
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,533
Get at it.

322
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,100
- All right, ladies,
gather around.

323
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,700
In a moment, you'll head
to the telenovela set,

324
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,934
and tomorrow on the main stage,

325
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,700
the category is...

326
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,967
<i>Latina lamorosa extravaganza.</i>

327
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,066
- Ooh.

328
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,233
- Señoritas.

329
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,066
Good luck

330
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:45,066
and don't fuck it up.

331
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,867
Bye,<i> eses.</i>

332
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,800
- Her critique was about
this mask.

333
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,300
I don't feel it anymore.

334
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,300
- Girl, I've been read too many
times for wearing masks.

335
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
- Yeah.

336
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,433
- I've been working with
this mask the whole day.

337
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:01,367
- I always listen to critiques,

338
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,233
and she told us that
for a reason.

339
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,500
- I think that people are taking
this whole mask thing

340
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,333
a little bit too seriously.

341
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,934
- So we're good on costumes?

342
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,767
- Uh, pretty much.

343
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,433
- Do you think I should wear
this dress, Jinkx?

344
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,567
The gold one.

345
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,767
- Now she's just going through
my wardrobe.

346
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,700
- I don't know what's going on
with Alyssa.

347
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,200
She's over in Jinkx's wardrobe,

348
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,900
trying to find something to wear
for the challenge?

349
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Good luck with that.

350
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,734
- Ow, fuck!

351
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,066
- What are you doing?

352
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:36,467
- I just stabbed myself.

353
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,700
Girl, all tea, all shade,

354
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,533
the dress doesn't fit.

355
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,166
- [sighs]

356
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,567
- You've got a ton of--
- Bull fantasy fat.

357
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,867
- Alyssa, for a pageant girl,

358
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,667
she sure didn't bring
no clothes.

359
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,266
I think it's time for her to go.

360
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:57,867
And I don't think I'm the only
one that feels that way.

361
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,900
-<i> Coming up...</i>

362
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,567
Meet your handsome leading man.

363
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,533
- What?

364
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,934
- [screams]

365
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:08,800
- [moans]

366
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,633
- That's your orgasm, Alyssa?

367
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,467
- Have you ever had one?

368
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:14,667
- [laughing]

369
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,166
- [laughing]

370
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:25,300
- Team Detox.

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>Hola, como esta?</i>

372
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,834
- Oh!

373
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:31,100
- My group is just about to
start shooting our telenovela,

374
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,066
and we're ready to blow it out
of the fucking park.

375
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,400
- Welcome to this lavish set,

376
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,767
furnished by Form Decor.

377
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:42,800
And say hello
to Maria Conchita Alonso.

378
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,266
- Que bonitas.

379
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,400
[overlapping greetings]

380
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,500
- And, ladies, meet your
handsome leading man...

381
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,967
Wilmer Valderrama.

382
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,500
- What?
[screaming]

383
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Shut up!

384
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,734
- He is so gorgeous.

385
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,400
I want to have his babies.

386
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
- All right.

387
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,667
<i>Accion.</i>

388
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,367
- Diego.

389
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,133
<i>Que paso?</i>

390
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,433
- He is dead.

391
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,333
And now we must determine which

392
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,333
one of us killed him.

393
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,066
- I couldn't kill him.

394
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:18,600
Diego loved me.

395
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,500
And...

396
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,433
I gave him my virginity.

397
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,867
[all gasping]

398
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,734
And--

399
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:29,767
- Cut.

400
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,734
Try to keep the pace up.

401
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:33,700
<i>Accion.</i>

402
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
- Bring us the poison.

403
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,667
[glass clinking]

404
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:55,233
Our poison bit is going on
a long time.

405
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:02,100
Roxxxy and I are sort of
standing there like--

406
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
- Cut.

407
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,133
When you're serving it,

408
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,567
you don't really
have to be serving three

409
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,533
because we can't see that
you're going one, two, three.

410
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:08,567
- Okay.

411
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,233
- So to make it faster, just--
you know?

412
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:12,734
- Oh, okay, so--okay.

413
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,266
- Ladies, let's get into
your positions.

414
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,200
Now, Roxxxy, are you inching

415
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,066
over to Wilmer's crotch?

416
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,934
- Only my hand,
but you can't see it, right?

417
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,767
[laughter]

418
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,834
- Horn dog.

419
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,767
- Action.

420
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,367
- [gasps]
- [grunts]

421
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:27,433
- [gasps]

422
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,900
- Agh!

423
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,867
- Cut.

424
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,100
Could we tighten up
the slapping?

425
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,200
It looked a little,
you know--

426
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,734
- Both: [grunt]

427
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,133
- Agh!

428
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,900
- Cut.
Okay.

429
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,567
Ladies, you're fine.

430
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,433
- What?
- Thank you very much.

431
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,967
- Bye, Wilmer.

432
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,233
- Team Alyssa.

433
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,066
<i>Como esta?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Muy bien.

434

- Si.

435
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,233
- We're prepared,

436
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,700
and we are prepared
to take this set by storm

437
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,934
and really deliver the drama.

438
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:56,934
-<i> Accion.</i>

439
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,667
- [gasps]

440
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,834
- It is I who cast the spell.

441
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:04,667
- You are<i> muy estupida</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

some Sofia "Vergar-r-a-rasa"
realness.

445
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,467
When I'm not talking,

446
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:21,066
I want to be reacting to what
other people are saying.

447
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,367
- Maria, I have some bad news.

448
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,266
If you hear the names of food,

449
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:31,066
you will orgasm so violently.

450
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,066
- Chimichanga.

451
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,667

- Nacho grande!

- Ah!
- Ay, ay!

456
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,633
- Oh, oh!

[gasping]

458
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:45,900
- Cut.

459
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,133
When Jinkxy is doing the orgasm,

460
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,700
Alyssa, you need to at least
match

461
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,734
what Jinkx is doing.

462
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,734
- Okay.

463
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,100
- Ah, come on, Alyssa,

464
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,266
I really, really want you
to pull this off.

465
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,567
We are a team.

466
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,834
- And it's supposed to be
an orgasm, so, you know--

467
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,834
- Yeah.

468
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,100
I was trying to be like

469
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,867
a 48-year-old having it.

470
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:04,066
- Yeah, but you also want to

471
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,266
steal the scene, you know.

472
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,667
- Yeah, okay.

473
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,467
- Chimichanga.

- [whimpering]

- Whoever Alyssa is sleeping
with

477
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,133
is apparently
not doing their job.

478
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,734
- [sobbing]

479
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,066
No!
- And cut.

480
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:27,266
That's your orgasm, Alyssa?

481
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,967
- Have you ever had one?

482
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,433
- Yeah.

483
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,967
I'm feeling so insecure,

484
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,333
and it's frustrating

485
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,934
because I want to be so fierce
and so sickening,

486
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:40,100
and I'm not.

487
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,767

- Have you seen Maria
or her mother?

- No esta aqui.

490
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,133
- Cut.

491
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,800
- No estan.
- No estan.

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,100
- Aqui.
- Aqui.

- Yes.
- No estan aqui.

494

They are--

Oh, my God.

Ooh.

498
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
- Cut.

499
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
- I looked at him,

500
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,467
and I forgot my line.

501
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:10,300
- Would you like to have dinner
with me?

502
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
- [purrs]

503
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,266
I forgot my line, Ru.

504
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,433
- That's not gonna do anything

505
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,834
for us as a group.

506
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:22,467
I'm nervous because
I don't want my very best

507
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:25,633
to be overshadowed
by someone else's very worst.

508
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,934
- That's a wrap.

509
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,934
[energetic salsa music]

510
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:31,967
- Ooh.

511
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,100
- Get ready for the kraken.

512
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
- Get ready for the kraken,
darling.

513
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,367
- Coming into tonight's
elimination,

514
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,233
we're all on pins and needles,

515
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:43,467
because we do not know
what the edited,

516
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,000
finished product
is gonna look like.

517
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
Look, someone's gonna go home,

518
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,800
so I need to get my wigs ready.

519
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
- Alyssa, if you wear
one more do, bitch,

520
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
where you whip it off
to one side--

521
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,266
- Girl, if you wear one more
stretch costume, girl--

522

- [gasps]

523
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,333
- Go work on your outfits,

524
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,367
'cause I think
you're running out.

525
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,500
- Ooh!
- It's done.

526
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,800
- Wait, wait, wait, Alyssa,

527
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,133
do you have enough stuff
to get through

528
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,433
the rest of the competition?

529
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,500
- Girl, yes, ma'am.

530
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,867
And I can sew if I have to sew.

531
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,967
- Alyssa, you ain't gonna
have to sew

532
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,066
'cause you'll be goin' in
everybody else's wardrobe.

533
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,934
- Oh!
- Ah!

534
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,800
- Hold on now,
let's get something clear.

535
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,300
That was for the challenge.

536
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
Baby, I ain't never wore none

865
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,667

866
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,533
this really wasn't Detox's
best effort.

867
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,433
And I expect more from her.

868
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:09,066
- Well, she slapped very good.
[laughs]

869
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,700
- Which is very important
in a telenovela.

870
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,767
- Yes.

871
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,133
- She was funny-ish
with baby<i> dos</i>

872
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,934
but could have been
so much bigger.

873
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:16,633
Like, that was
a wasted opportunity.

874
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,567
- Roxxxy Andrews.

875
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,633
- She looked so pretty
with that black hair,

876
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,233
and her makeup looked gorgeous.

877
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:24,533
And her body shape
with the cinch waist.

878
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:25,834
She just melted my loins.

879
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,834
- Well, I loved seeing her
cinched in like that.

880
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,166
And the hair, and she drew on
the Latin curls.

881
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,166
- Oh, on the face.
That's so cute.

882
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,133
Yeah.
And in the telenovela.

883
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:35,100
- She was strong.

884
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,967
Everything she did,
the physicality,

885
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,200
her voice, the pitch.

886
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
She stood out.

887
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,867
- Roxxxy redeemed herself
this week

888
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,967
from the past two weeks
of kind of letting us down.

889
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:45,433
- Alaska.

890
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,667
- Ella No Es Dama really was

891
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,467
the better of the two
telenovelas because of Alaska.

892
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,166
- It was a very layered
performance.

893
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,300
She's a gifted comedian.

894
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,467
- Tonight on the runway,

895
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,233
the dress looked really cheap.

896
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,600
But she gave us
a little more ass.

897
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,333
- Yes.
- And you like that.

898

What did you think of her outfit
on the runway?

902
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,367
- Whoever made that for her
is fired.

903
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,166

905
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,400
- And what'd you think of her
in the telenovela?

906
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,700
- That role could have been
so, so big and funny,

907
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,800
because she's so intriguing
to me.

908
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
- How is it that
she doesn't know

909
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,333
how to ham it up
in front of a camera?

910
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,066
- She doesn't know
what she's got.

911
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,900
- She was already talking about,
like,

912
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,633
having to lip sync for her life
tonight.

913
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,800
- If that inner dialogue
is saying,

914
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,066
you know,
"I'm gonna fail at this

915
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,200
or I'm not any good at this,"

916
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,066

- Jinkxy Monsoon.

00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,700
- She is a very good actress.

919
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,900
She's beautiful.
She's funny.

920
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,867
- She took that script,
and she made it her own.

921
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:49,066
- That takes a really talented
person to be able to do that.

922
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:52,367
- She looked flawless
in that telenovela.

923
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,834
- Yeah.

924
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:55,800
It was shocking.

925
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I think she looked fierce

926
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,066
the way she did it.

927
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:01,433
- I loved the<i> cojones</i>
it took to do that,

928
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:05,100
and it really did
catch me by surprise.

929
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Coco Montrese.

930
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,066
- I thought she looked gorgeous.

931
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,967
I mean, this is her color,
the shape,

932
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,200
even the cheapish flowers.

933
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,500
In the novela, there were a lot
of weird choices

934
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,800
and missed opportunities.

935
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,567
A lot of literal acting out,

936
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,300
which is, like, cardinal sin
number one.

937
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,767
- I wanted her to stand out
so much more.

938
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,633
It felt as if her role
was insignificant

939
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,800
until the end
when you realized what it was,

940
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,400
and then you just wished
that it was more than that.

941
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,100
- Silence.

00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,467

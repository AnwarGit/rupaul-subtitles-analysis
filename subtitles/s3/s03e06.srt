5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,633

you've perpetuated stereotypes.

The competition heats up.

15
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:30,400

you feel like you about to die?

00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,633
I just feel like stuff keeps
coming back

54
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,667
and just knocking me down.

55
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,934
- God, Manila won
the challenge.

56
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,900
- Yeah.
- How sad is that?

57
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,734
- I thought she did
really good.

58
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,066
- You don't think it was, like,
a little bit risky

59
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,066
that she was making fun of
some--

60
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,367
- She was making fun
of a culture

61
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:11,600
that she looks to be a part of,
but she's not.

62
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,834
You know, it just made me
uncomfortable,

63
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,767
but the judges seemed
to enjoy that.

64
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,133
So hallelu.

65
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,400
- Girls, it's just like
Margaret Cho.

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,734
That's what I was going for.

67
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,500
You know, she makes fun of her
Asian mom all the time.

68
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,633
- But she is of that culture.
That's her mom.

69
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:30,467
- It's really no different than
you doing black, Southern lady.

70
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,066
- Well, but I'm black,
and I'm from the South.

71
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,066
- She is not acting.
She is.

72
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,567
- I think that the whole
conversation is bullshit.

73
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,233
If a black girl was asked to be
funny,

74
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,166
the first thing they
immediately do is get ghetto,

75
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,867
get country, and I love it.

76
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,166
What's the difference, really?

77
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,533
- Some of us were doing it
as drag queens.

78
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,667
- Well, no, I think

79
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,567
that everybody on that set was
doing drag.

80
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,066
It was just a different
interpretation.

81
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,200
- It's your interpretation
of it.

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,333
- Yeah.
No reason to get mad.

83
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,500
- I just don't want to talk
about it.

84
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,834
- What's going on?

85
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,467
- They're just making it all,
like, a race thing,

86
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,533
and it's not.

87
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,600
- It's so not.

88
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,834
I don't mean this to be
offensive,

89
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:06,900
but do you have nail polish?

90
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,934
- [laughing]

91
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,200

But the brightest ones are
right here in Hollywood.

will you sparkle, Neely,
sparkle...

100
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,500

all: Hey!
- Hi, ladies. Wow.

00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,667

110
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,066

- Say it with me.

One by one, letters will pop
onto the screen.

Now, if you think you know
the answer, hit your buzzer.

115
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,767
But be careful, because if
you're wrong, you're out.

116
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:13,266
The last queen standing will win
a phone call home.

- Oh!

118
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,066

because I immediately think,

"Oh, my god, I have the
opportunity to call my grandma."

120
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,867
- Are you ready to play?

00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,200
She's gonna be like,
"Are you eating?"

00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,667
you're going to be guest stars
on a game show

181
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,066
we like to call...

182
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,300
Snatch Game!

183
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,066
[cheers and applause]

184
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,533
This is your chance to bring
to life

185
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,433
your best celebrity
impersonations.

186
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,467
Bottom line, you need to be
an entertainer

187
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,467
who really entertains.

188
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:26,567
I'll be back a little later to
check on your progress.

189
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,066
Gentlemen, start your engines.

190
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:35,734
And may the best Cher win,
okay?

191
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,533
- I remember Shangela saying,

192
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,934
"Oh, I would call
my grandmother,

193
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,533
and I would love
to just check up on her."

194
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,900
And I thought to myself,

195
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,567
"I don't need the phone call
right now."

196
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,934
Well, listen, the more I hear
about your grandmother

197
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,734
and, like, how she's kind of
on her own,

198
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,367
the phone call would be
better used by you, I think.

199
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,700
- Oh, my god!

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,767
- You want it?

201
00:07:54,767 --> 00:08:00,834
- It was a really sincere gift
that was so unselfish of her.

202
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,600
It touched me.

203
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
- So what you doing?

204
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,600
- Child, miss,
I'm Joan Crawford.

205
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,967
- Oh, work.

206
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,667
Do you ever do, like,
impersonations?

207
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,667
- Oh, bitch, I got this nailed.

208
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,900
I am Joan Crawford.

209
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,300
Yes.

210
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
- I'm debating between
Anna Nicole and Fran Drescher.

211
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,233
- I don't even know.
Who is that?

212
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,133
- Fran Drescher.
♪<i> The nanny ♪</i>

213
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,467
- You are doing Tina?

214
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,700
- Nico-Tina Turner.

215
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,934
She's doing Nico-Tina.
I'm doing Alicia Keys.

216
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,433
- Okay, I think I've decided
on it.

217
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,600
- What have you decided on?

218
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,667
- Anna Nicole.

219
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,200
- Girl, you're being
a bit flip-floppy.

220
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
- I've decided
I'm gonna do Anna Nicole

221
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,333
because she loves pink;
I love pink myself.

222
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,734
Should I make
a silver and pink dress?

223
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,800
- W-w-a-n-d.

224
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,066
What would Anna Nicole do?

225
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,333
I love my girl Stacy.

226
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,700
But I don't feel that she's
completely confident

227
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,133
in what she's saying.

228
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,266
So I'm wondering, "Is she gonna
be able to pull this off?"

229
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,367
- Today we're doing
the Snatch Game,

230
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,834
celebrity impersonation.

231
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,133
- I'm a little concerned
about my character,

232
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,667
'cause I don't think
Alicia Keys is funny.

233
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,266
- So how are you gonna
combat that?

234
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,900
- I'll do my best, honey.

235
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
- So, um, what are you
gonna do?

236
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,834
- Um, I'm gonna do
Imelda Marcos.

237
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,333
- Yay!

238
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,300
- After all this, like, Asian
accent talk this morning,

239
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,066
I think that I'm gonna go out
on a limb

240
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,967
and do another Asian accent.

241
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,266
I'm going to be showing a lot of
my Filipino pride.

242
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,633
[door squeaking open]

243
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,500
- Hello, lady-kins!

244
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,967
- Hi!
- Hi, Ru!

245
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,166
- Hey, Delta.
What you have here?

246
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,233
- I am doing Cher.

247
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,767
- What?
- I know.

248
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,367
- I happen to know she's a fan
of this show.

249
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,367
- Oh, wow.

250
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,500
- You know
she'll be watching this.

251
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah, no pressure.

252
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,967
Every queen in the world is
gonna be watching this,

253
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,467
and everyone
who's ever done Cher

254
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,767
is gonna be watching this.

255
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,600
- Sure.
- So you have to represent.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,100
- I can certainly try.

257
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:01,500
- Hey, Raja.
- Hi, Ru.

258
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,533
- Who do we have here?

259
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,900
- I'm doing Tyra.

260
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
- Now, didn't she win the last
<i>RuPaul Drag Race?</i>

261
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,033
- No, not the other Tyra,
the actual Tyra.

262
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,033
- [giggles]

263
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,266
- I wanted to do her

264
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,934
'cause this is someone
that I know firsthand,

265
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,500
and I've been in the same room
with all of her Tyra-isms.

266
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,767
Sometimes she's, like,
quite proper

267
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:17,800
and she seems really educated,

268
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,533
and then she'll just like,
"Hey!"

269
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,900
You know, "Mm-hmm!"

270
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,600
- Tyra-ize them, hunty.

271
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,900
- Honey, word!
Uh!

272
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,467
- [laughs]

273
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:28,700
Yara Sofia.

274
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,867
- Hi.

275
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,600
- Hola, mami.
- Hola.

276
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,633
- Who do we have here?

277
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,567
- Amy Winehouse.

278
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,100
- You're from Puerto Rico.
- Yes.

279
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,900
- She's from England.
- England.

280
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,500
- How are you gonna do that?
[laughs]

281
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,033
- Well, I've been watching
Hatty Potter, so probably--

282
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,300
- Harry Potter?
- Hatty Potter, yeah.

283
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,266
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.

284
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,500
[both laughing]

285
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,333
- [with not an English accent]
Can I have some water?

286
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,066
- [laughs]

287
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,200
- How'd it sound?

288
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,633
- By George,
I think you've got it!

289
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:01,734
- Really?
- Yes.

290
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,934
All right, darling,
I'm gonna go this way.

291
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:06,633
Carmen Carrera.
- Hi, my love.

292
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,700
- Look at that face.
It's beat down.

293
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,233
Now, I see that you have padded
your already fat ass even more.

294
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,333
Stand up.
Let me take a look.

295
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,467
Are you doing J.Lo?

296
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,567
- I am.

297
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,133
- You are doing J.Lo?
- Yeah.

298
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:24,867
- You know that you are sitting
behind a desk?

299
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,367
- Well, I asked for a throne,

300
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,467
so I'm just hoping that
I have that when I get there,

301
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:30,667
'cause I'm gonna be
really upset,

302
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,934
and I'm gonna have to call
somebody.

303
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,700
- Yes, thank you very much,
Jennifer.

304
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
And I will see you on the set.
- Yes.

305
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,734
- All right, see you
in a minute.

306
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:37,834
- Thank you.

307
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,967
- Alexis Mateo.

308
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,166
- Hi, Ru.

309
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,166
- I know exactly who this is.
- Who is it?

310
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,200
- It's Alicia Keys.
- Oh, you got it right.

311
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,567
- How are you gonna make
Alicia Keys funny?

312
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,867
- I'm gonna be a pregnant, butch
Alicia Keys.

313
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:53,100
- [giggles]

314
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,467
Well,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.

315
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,533
I see a blonde wig.
Dolly Parton?

316
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,734
- Anna Nicole.

317
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,066
- How are you gonna convey
Anna Nicole Smith?

318
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,367
- The fabulous shoes
with the pink on them.

319
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,800
- Oh, okay.
- With my purse.

320
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,400
- So you're gonna rely on your
purse and your shoes?

321
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,800
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm not sold.

322
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,133
- Yeah?

323
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,133
- Yeah, because you know

324
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,667
you were in the bottom two
last week.

325
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:17,633
- Yes.

326
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,133
- What are you gonna do to
ensure

327
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,567
you won't be there again
this week?

328
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,367
- I'm gonna give everything
I have, because--

329
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,166
- Well, you said that last time,
giving everything.

330
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,233
It's got to be more than just,

331
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,700
"I'm gonna give
everything I have."

332
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,367
- I'm gonna bring
something new.

333
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,500
- You got to bring it, baby.
- I will.

334
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,200
- I'm rooting for you,
Stacy Matthews.

335
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,900
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, baby.

336
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,266
And they call this queen Mariah.

337
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,600
- Howdy do?

338
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,900
- Oh, my go--am I feeling
a little Joan Crawford here?

339
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,066
- Yes.
- I love it!

340
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,834
- Okay, she was such a bitch,
and I love her.

341
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,533
- Well, it's funny you're doing
Joan Crawford,

342
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,433
because a lot of the criticism
you've gotten

343
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,066
on the main stage

344
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,633
are all the things
that Joan Crawford is not.

345
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,433
She's strong. She's powerful.
She's concise.

346
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,066
- I'm very much Joan Crawford.

347
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,667
I don't think that on the runway
I've never given anything

348
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,934
but confidence and strength
and poise and elegance.

349
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,633
- Mariah, will you walk me
to my car?

350
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,333
[giggles]

351
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,600
All right, ladies,
gather around.

352
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,867
Today's Snatch Game contestants

353
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,200
are sexy celebrities
in their own right.

354
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,767
Model and red carpet phenomenon
Amber Rose is here.

355
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,100
[applause]

356
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,967
- Oh, my god, what?
Amber Rose?

357
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,467
I love Amber Rose.

358
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,367
- And one of my favorites,

359
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:39,233
actress and comedienne
Aisha Tyler will be here.

360
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,600
- Oh, wow.

361
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,066
- Amber and Aisha are also
your guest judges this week.

362
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,500
all: Ooh.
- Yes.

363
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,233
Ladies, the game is on.

364
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:53,100
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

365
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,467
All right, see you later.

366
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,133
- Bye, Ru.

367
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,433
- I just want to punch a wall.

368
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,667
Why am I here?

369
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,600
Why am I here?

370
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,900
I feel like this is the lowest
point in the whole competition.

371
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Whatever.

372
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,867
- What are you over?

373
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,066
- Well, she keeps bringing
the god damn bullshit up.

374
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,533
I can't...

375
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,834
- What do you mean?

376
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,233
- "Well, you said that
last week."

377
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,266
Don't keep bringing that up.

378
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,400
That's not helping me.

379
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,767
- Stacy, maybe that is trying
to help you.

380
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,266
- But it's not.

381
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,567
- But that's what I'm saying,

382
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,333
is maybe she's trying
to give you a heads-up.

383
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,800
I know how you feel.

384
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,233
But if she gave you
that recommendation

385
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,967
of she's not feeling it,

386
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,967
I would come up
with something else.

387
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,500
Who else--who else
is pop culture right now

388
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,533
that you can do?

389
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,066
- What about Mo'nique?
- Mo'nique.

390
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,066
Do fucking Mo'nique.
- [sighs]

391
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,867
- Don't get frustrated.
Let's do this.

392
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,066
- I don't want to give up,

393
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,500
because this is a dream for me.

394
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,066
I don't want to go
the fuck home.

395
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,066
- Hello, and welcome
to the new Snatch Game.

396
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm your host, RuPaul.

397
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,834
Now let's meet our first
contestant.

398
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,266
She's a model from South Philly.

399
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:07,066
Please welcome Amber Rose.

400
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,300
- Hi.

401
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,667
- Up next, she's a talented
actress and comedienne.

402
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,333
Please welcome Aisha Tyler.

403
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,433
Hello, Aisha.

404
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,233
- Hello.

405
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,700
- And let's give
a Hollywood hello

406
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,967
to our star-studded celebrity
panel.

407
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,467
Well, hello, Cher.

408
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,600
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.

409
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,700
- Well, you know, I don't know
what the hell I'm doing here.

410
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,066
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.

411
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,266
- [laughing]

412
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,400
And next to her, we have

413
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,467
the former first lady
of the Philippines.

414
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,066
Imelda Marcos is with us.

415
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,767
- Mabuhay, mabuhay!

416
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,867
- At least this time, she picked
a Filipino.

417
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:49,100
- Of course, next to her, we
have media mogul and supermodel

418
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,700
Tyra Banks is in the house.

419
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,200
Hello, Tyra.
- Hey, Ru.

420
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,734
- Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.

421
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,700
What do they call that?

422
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,767
- Smizing.

423
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,300
- [laughing]

424
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,467
- Next to her, we have Academy
Award winner Mo'nique.

425
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,500
Mo'nique, is everything...

426
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,433
- Precious!

427
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,900
- Uh-oh, is Precious
back there?

428
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,333
- Mm-hmm, she better be
cooking me something to eat.

429
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,266
- [laughing]

430
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,066
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

431
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:18,066
With us
is the fantastic Tina Turner.

432
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,200
Hello, Tina.
- All right, RuPaul.

433
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,066
- Are you gonna be nice or
rough on the Snatch Game?

434
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,066
- I always do it rough.

435
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,500
- [laughing]

436
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,600
- Next to her is the late, great
Joan Crawford.

437
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Now, that is not a wire hanger.
- It's not.

438
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,567
- What is it?
- It's a wooden hanger.

439
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,333
- Mariah's Joan Crawford,
I think it's a little crunchy,

440
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,500
and I don't think Joan

441
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,433
would ever allow herself
to look that bad.

442
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:51,300
- Next to her, of course, is
Grammy winner Alicia Keys.

443
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,633
- Ooh, ooh!

444
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,100
New York!

445
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,900
Now, Alicia, a little birdie
tells me

446
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,633
that you got a secret
to tell us.

447
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:05,266
- Yo, I am pregnant,
and I am fierce, ah!

448
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,400
- All right, next to her
is the incomparable--

449
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,600
Jennifer Lopez is with us.

450
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,266
And, honey, I got your rider.

451
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,400
- Yeah, compliment, compliment,
question.

452
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,133
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

453
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:20,533
- Next to her is England's
gorgeous rock superstar

454
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,967
Amy Winehouse.

455
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,100
Hey, Amy.

456
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,367
- Hi, how are you?

457
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:26,667
- [laughing]

458
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,934
- I think this is your first
game show in America.

459
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,633
Have you done game shows
in England?

460
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,900
- Yes, yes.
[garbled speech] Once.

461
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,800
Um, I have...

462
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,233
- Yes.

463
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:41,266
All right, Amber, Aisha, I will
ask a series of questions,

464
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:44,200
and our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.

465
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,166
You give an answer you think
will match theirs.

466
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,233
Are you ready to snatch
the stars?

467
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,734
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

468
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,967
- Starting with Aisha.

469
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:58,900
Crazy Daisy is so crazy, she
thinks a Kardashian is a...

470
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,166
- Country in Africa.
- That's a very good answer.

471
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,567
Let's see if you got any matches
up here.

472
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,233
Oh, you've got more shoes,
Imelda.

473
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,166
- These ones have sparkles
on here.

474
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,400
It match your outfit.

475
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,066
- Did you write down
your answer? Good, good.

476
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,700
- Designer shoe?

477
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,467
- Not a match
but a very good answer.

478
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,200
All right, Tyra.

479
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,533
- I only have one answer
in my hand.

480
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:23,066
And this answer
is the only answer.

481
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,967
Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!

482
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:29,066
I hate her. I hate her.
I hate her!

483
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,734
She ruined my life!

484
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,166
- [laughing]
- Smizing.

485
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,266
- All right, Mo'nique.
- Yeah?

486
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,767
- No, it's cool. It's cool.
We cool, Mo'nique.

487
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,233
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.

488
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,800
All right, let's go to the great
Joan Crawford.

489
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,900
- My eyebrows.
- "My eyebrows."

490
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,734
- That was almost...

491
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:48,467
nothing like what I put down,
but...

492
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,533
- All right, let's go
to Amy Winehouse.

493
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,600
Crazy Daisy thinks a Kardashian
is a...

494
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,367
- Lubricant remover.
- Lubricant remover.

495
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,767
- That's a great answer,
actually.

496
00:18:58,767 --> 00:18:59,867
- It is a great answer.

497
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:03,333
Unfortunately, Aisha,
it's not a match.

498
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,066
Up next, Amber Rose.

499
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:09,967
Psycho Sally is so psycho,

500
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:13,800
instead of kissing her dates
good night, she blanks them.

501
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
- She stabs them.

502
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,767
- Let's start with Cher.

503
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,133
Instead of kissing her dates
good night...

504
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,934
- She buys them tickets
to my never-ending tour.

505
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,066
- Not a match.

506
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,433
All right, Tyra Banks.

507
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,600
- That answer is "smizes."

508
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,133
- She smizes them.

509
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,800
- And Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!

510
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,734
- [laughing]

511
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,667
Tita Turter, what do you have?

512
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:41,400
- She sends them rollin' down
the river.

513
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,734
All right.

514
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,066
- All right, Joan Crawford,
Psycho Sally...

515
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,433
- She cuts their rose bushes.

516
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:49,700
- No, unfortunately, that is
not a match.

517
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,533
- Mariah could've given us
a little bit more drama.

518
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,166
You always remember
the shrieking kind of--

519
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,467
you know, that intensity
from Joan Crawford

520
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,700
and especially
in<i> Mommie Dearest.</i>

521
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,166
It would've been nice to see
a little bit more

522
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,467
of that extremity.

523
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,633
- Alicia Keys, let's see
if you match Amber Rose.

524
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,800
- I match you, Amber.

525
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,233
- Yes.
- Completely.

700
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,433
When people are talking
about you,

701
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,066
that means
you're doing something right.

702
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,100
This hair is not soundproof.

703
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,300
- If she hears it,
then she hears it.

704
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,667
I don't have to scream it
out loud,

705
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,467
but I will use my normal tone
of voice,

706
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,834
and I will let her know that
"you know what?

707
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,066
Do it yourself."

708
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,567
- Just so you know, Cousin It
can still hear you.

709
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,734
- What makes a good
impersonator,

710
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:59,867
and what makes a good female
illusionist?

711
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,700
- Carmen, you should've asked
this question yesterday.

712
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,066
- Right.

713
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,867
Maybe I should've thought of
y'all answers yesterday.

714
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:08,633
- Don't be a jerk!
Such a jerk.

715
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,066
- Sorry.

716
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,633
- I remember my elementary
school teacher

717
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,867
called me a jerk one time.

718
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,667
- Really?
- I called her a heifer.

719
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,600
I grew up in Gainesville,
Georgia.

720
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,300
It was not the easiest
experience.

721
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,200
No, I pretty much was picked on
for one reason or another.

722
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Either I sounded too white
or I wasn't black enough.

723
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,066
I just didn't fit in.

724
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,233
I just knew I needed to get

725
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,800
where I had a lot more
opportunity.

726
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,767
And I stumbled into the world
of drag.

727

Girl, I'm gonna get my life.

They call this queen Mariah.

- Her legs are amazing.
- Gorgeous legs.

766
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:17,567
- I am a wild animal
on the runway.

767
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:20,533
I stalk my prey, I hunt,
and I pounce.

in this competition.

Moving forward, I want you to

You three may leave the stage.

Let's start with Raja.

839
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,233

840
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,166
[clicking tongue]

841
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,633

[laughter]

843
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,767
- You bring it to the runway
every time.

844
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:38,133
And I love this global warrior
princess you've got going on.

845
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,967
And as far as your Tyra Banks, I
laughed out loud several times.

846
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:44,100
- I thought because
you know her so well,

847
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,867
you could've done so much more,

848
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,567
because she is a human
caricature.

849
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,133
- I loved
your runway look today.

850
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,667
I thought that it was bold,
drama.

851
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,200
You know, it really felt
editorial.

852
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,300
It really felt high fashion.

853
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,667
And that was really exciting
to see.

854
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,700
- Thank you, Raja.

855
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,834
Up next, Alexis Mateo.

856
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,233
- I loved your Alicia Keys.

857
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,567
You killed that.
It was so, so funny.

858
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,133
- I love the color,
and I love the bling on it.

859
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,934
You look like a real housewife
of Dubai.

860
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:12,233
- I love gaudy things,

861
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:15,567
and that's very gaudy
and sparkly and glamorous.

862
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:16,934
And I think you look great.

863
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,934
And the fact that you were
flirting with me was a plus.

864
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:23,400
And I was like, "Damn, I'm gonna
get some Alicia tonight."

[laughter]

866
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,367
- Stacy.

867
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:33,333
You told me that you were going
to be Anna Nicole Smith.

868
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,600
What had happened?

869
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,066
- I feel like I'm relating more
to Mo'nique,

870
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,667
so that's why I switched.

871
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,867
- You stayed physically
in that character.

872
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,166
Your facial expression
was completely different.

873
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,166
You know, you had the--

874
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,433
yeah, and you held it, mama.

875
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,333
You never fell out.
Look at--

876
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,867
[laughter]

877
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,066
- You're so beautiful.

878
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,867
I mean, you're representing
the big girls,

879
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:52,734
and you're doing a great job.

880
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:55,967
I mean, you have, like, breasts,
and it looks amazing.

881
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,533
You look so good.
Like, wow.

882
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:02,467
- I'm so proud of you tonight,
Stacy.

883
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:03,800
You stepped it up this week.

884
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,600
You need to now realize
that you can't go back.

885
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,633
- Yep.

886
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,433
- All right, thank you, Stacy.

887
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:13,166
Raja, Alexis, Stacy...

888
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,667
you may leave the stage.

889
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,133
Yara Sofia.

890
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:20,567
Let's start with you.

891
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,066
Aisha?
- I loved your look today.

892
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,200
I thought it was really
original.

893
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,667
It was really exciting.

894
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,500
That being said, I struggled
a little bit

895
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,800
with your Amy Winehouse.

896
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,900
I could not understand the
accent that you were doing.

897
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
I was like, "Is she German?"

898
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,433
- I'm totally into your
dark, wicked bitch look

899
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,533
that you got going on.

900
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:41,066
I like your own brand

901
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,533
of what you're bringing
to this competition.

902
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:47,533
- Because Amy is such a big
character, we want more.

903
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:50,367
You have it.
Give it all.

904
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:54,066
- I will. I will.

905
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,734
- Next up, Mariah.

906
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:58,433
How'd you feel
walking the runway?

907
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,400
- Frankly, I'm surprised to be
down here.

908
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,834
I definitely believe that
there's someone more qualified

909
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,600
to be in my position right now.

910
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,233
- Who?
- Carmen Carrera.

911
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,233
She played a bitchy version of
herself.

912
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,400
If I wanted to be offensive,

913
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,066
I could play a knock-off
Filipino.

914
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,166
But I'm not a judge, so--
- I'll speak for myself.

915
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,667
You know,
being a Joan Crawford fan,

916
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:22,233
I was so happy that you chose
to do that role.

917
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,700
I was disappointed, though,

918
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,233
that there were a lot of missed
opportunities with punch lines.

919
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,600
Were you happy with your
performance?

920
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,200
- I was--I was--I was pleased
with my performance, yes, ma'am.

921
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,467
- All right.

922
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,066
Next up, Delta.

923
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:39,300
- If you're gonna be a queen
and you're gonna deliver Cher,

924
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,767
bitch, you better deliver Cher.

925
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,900
You were shy Cher.

926
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,467
- There are so many Cher-isms,

927
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,600
and I didn't want to rely
on what you've seen.

928
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,533
And I thought what I would do
was amp it up,

929
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,867
and I didn't turn the knob
completely.

930
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,467
- Delta, what's going on?

931
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,900
Why are you holding back?

932
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,867
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

933
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:01,066
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

934
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,400
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

935
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
the judges and I will
deliberate.

936
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,166
You may leave the stage.

937
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,967
Okay, just between us girls,
what do you think?

938
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,333
Let's start with Raja.

939
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,600
- Raja on the runway was,
for me,

940
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,467
far and away, the top dog today.

941
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,500
- Being that she has worked
with Tyra,

942
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,800
she could have made it
a little more irreverent.

943
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,967
- But then Tyra would have sued
the shit out of us.

944
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,233
[laughter]

945
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,600
Let's talk about Alexis.

946
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,066
- Her Alicia
was fully realized,

947
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,200
not just the voice

948
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,066
but the look, the physicality,
the jokes.

949
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,233
It was like
your granddaddy's boat;

950
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,433
it was tightened up.

951
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:38,900
- I'm kind of stuck with Alexis.
- Really?

952
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,967
- 'Cause I feel like
she's stuck.

953
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,066
I feel like we're seeing the
same thing in different colors.

954
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,266
- But she killed Alicia Keys,
in a good way.

955
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:48,166
- Well, let's move on
to Mo'nique.

956
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,834
- She was funny even when
she didn't speak.

957
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,066
She really was in that character
at all times.

958
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:54,734
- As far as the runway goes,
really?

959
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,800
Your favorite drag look are
those pants,

960
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
which happen to be--
you know, she's hanging

961
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,567
with her besties,
Poly and Esther.

962
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,567
- Yara Sofia.

963
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,533
- Obviously, the accent
did not work.

964
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,133
- In the beginning,
it was funny.

965
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,900
Then it got, like, really dry
and not in a good way.

966
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,934
- But she made brave choices
on the runway.

967
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:11,900
The dreads were off the hook.

968
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,200
That face makeup was what-what.

969
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,767
- Miss Mariah.

970
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,633
- I don't understand
the black cheeks.

971
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:20,166
- It was Lily Munster.
- It was!

972
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,533
That wasn't Joan Crawford.

973
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,066
She would never go out without
blending all that in.

974
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,066
- It was a really bad
Joan Crawford.

975
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,700
There was just so much
that she didn't do.

976
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,066
- Well, it's been her criticism
before

977
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,433
that she sort of fakes her way
to the middle.

978
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,433
- She could sleep her way to
the top.

979
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,700
- Even when you get to the top,

980
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,266
you're gonna have to have
something to deliver.

981
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:36,934
Delta Work.

982
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:40,100
- It's Cher. You learn that
in Drag School 101.

983
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,700
- You need to have
that confidence.

984
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,767
When you walk into a room,
it's like, "Honey, I'm here,

985
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,266
and I'm Cher."

986
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,600
She didn't do that.

987
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,066
- I just want to say to Delta,
"Schnap out of it!"

988
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,567
Silence!

989
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,900
I've made my decision.

990
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,533
Tina!

991
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,667
Bring me the axe.

992
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,500
Welcome back, ladies.

993
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,633
Now, based on your performance
in the Snatch Game

994
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,400
and your presentation
on the main stage,

995
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,700
I've made some decisions.

996
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,567
Raja...

997
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:16,066
your impersonation of Tyra Banks
smizing

998
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:18,066
brought tears to my eyes.

999
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:19,367
You're safe.

1000
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,133
Alexis Mateo.

1001
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:26,934
No one, no one, no one

1002
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,300
can do Alicia Keys like you.

1003
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,467
You're safe.

1004
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:38,300
- Stacy, I had all but given up
on you.

1005
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,333
But you played
to your strengths,

1006
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,233
and you came out on top.

1007
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,734
Isn't that precious?

1008
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:47,066
- Yes.

1009
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,500
- Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge.

1010
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,400
[applause]

1011
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,867
And you've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas

1012
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,066
from ALandCHUCK.travel.

1013
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,166
- After being in the bottom

1014
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,800
and all these bitches
talking shit,

1015
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,600
saying, "Stacy Matthews,
why are you here?"

1016
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
Fuck those bitches, honey. 

1017
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,166
- However,
you will not be immune

1018
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,567
from elimination next week.

1019
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:17,066
From this point forward, no one
will receive immunity.

1020
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:22,967
Ladies, make every moment count.

1021
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:25,200
Mariah...

1022
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,400
your impersonation
of Joan Crawford

1023
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,333
was not Mildred Fierce.

1024
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,700
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1025
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:39,066
- Being bottom two,
I didn't realize

1026
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:41,300
how emotional it could be.

1027
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,533
It's definitely intense.

1028
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,233
- Yara Sofia.

1029
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:48,233
Playing a mess does not give you
permission to be messy.

1030
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:51,867
Delta Work,
your impersonation of Cher

1031
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:56,600
didn't make any of us believe.

1032
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,834
I'm sorry, Delta, but you are up
for elimination.

1033
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:03,967
- To see Stacy win
and I'm in the bottom two

1034
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,200
was, just, like, the travesty
that's gonna go down

1035
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,166
in, like, history as WTF.

1036
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:13,633
- Yara, you may join
the other girls.

1037
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:17,100
Two queens stand before me.

1038
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,333
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1039
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:25,266
and save yourself
from elimination.

1040
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:28,867
The time has come...

1041
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:33,467
for you to lip-sync
for your life.

1042
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,467
Good luck.

1043
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,200
And don't fuck it up.

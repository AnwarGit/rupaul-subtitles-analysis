To decide which
of the eliminated queens

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,233
deserve to return.

I'm gonna do one of these.

Sorry about it, Shangela.

that another queen
is coming back,

- Boy, oh, boy.

Now as you know,

87
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,066
I gave the judges
a one-time opportunity

88
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:17,867
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens

89
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:22,066
if they could come to
a unanimous decision.

90
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,266
So...

91
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:27,166
let's see which queen,
if any,

92
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,100
is behind that door.

93
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,734
The moment of truth is upon us.

94
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,934
- I can't,
I don't wanna look.

- Yes.

I'm really happy that, you know,

106
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,100
the judges wanted me
to come back.

107
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,500
Like, that makes me feel
even more confident.

I have to bring it now.

- No, no, no, no!

00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,166

Carmen's used to

132
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,967
having balls thrown at her face.

00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,834

and I'm a little nervous.

I'm, like, "Damn,
she's gonna get me."

- No!

184
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,633
- All: Oh!

185
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,166
[buzzer buzzes]

186
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,700
- Up next, of course, is...

187
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,133
Carmen, hmmm.

188
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,734
- I think I'm gonna
have to choose Raja.

189
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:14,800
- No!
- Yeah!

190
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
- I want her to gag.

191
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,100
- Dunk her ass
like a donut, okay?

192
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,066
- Nooo!

193
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,066
- Aah!

194
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,133
- [laughing]

195
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,066
- Raja!

196
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,934
- [laughing]

197
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,500
- All: Whoo!

198
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,767
- The harder you throw,

199
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,066
the more you look like a dude,
okay?

200
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,300
That's all I'm saying.

201
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,367
- Oh, my God!

202
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,467
[buzzer buzzes]

203
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,567
- Oh, time's up, time's up.

204
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,767
All right, ladies.

205
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,667
With a total of 14 dunks,

206
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,133
the star pitcher
of RuPaul's Pink Sox is...

207
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,600
Alexis Rodriguez Mateo!

208
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,633
Condragulations, Alexis.

209
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,300
Now you kids go dry off

210
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,333
and I'll see you back in the
you-better-work room.

211
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,734
See you in a minute.
- Bye!

212
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,166
- Bye, Ru!

213
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,333
- Okay, kids.

214
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,066
Now that you're all warmed up,

215
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,900
I want you to meet
some real athletes.

216
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,300
- Oh, shit!

217
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,066
- Whoo!
- Hey!

218
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,967
- Come on in, babies.

219
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,567
Come on in.
Whoo!

220
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,967
- There's five guys
coming into the work room

221
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,533
and it smells like testosterone.

222
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,400
- For this week's
main challenge,

223
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,867
you'll be transforming these
straight jocks

224
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,834
into drag queens for a day.

225
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:38,300
- Oh, my God!

226
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,800
- [laughing]

227
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,266
Now using your own drag,
hair from Wig USA,

228
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,100
and other materials
we've provided,

229
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,200
I expect to see
a strong family resemblance.

230
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,233
Think of them as the Venus
to your Serena.

231
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,567
Gentlemen,
please introduce yourselves

232
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,200
and tell us your sport.

233
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,266
- Hi, I'm Matt.

234
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm 29, and I play baseball...
hard.

235
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,266
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

236
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,400
- Sorry about it.

237
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,367
- I'm Drew, I'm 23,
and I play rugby.

238
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,133
- My name is Slava, I'm 23,
and I play water polo.

239
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,734
- Hi, I'm Chevy, I'm 27,
I play baseball.

240
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,200
- My name's Christopher,
I'm 32,

241
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,066
I play basketball
from San Antonio, Texas.

242
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,166
- Yes.

243
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,600
- And yes, everything is bigger
in Texas.

244
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,700
- Now, Alexis, since you
won the mini-challenge,

245
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,800
you get to pair up
the guys and dolls.

246
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,233
- Heh, heh.

247
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,266
I love this part.

248
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,700
Come with me.

249
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,734
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

250
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,066
Raja, meet your partner.

251
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,533
- Hey, my baby.

252
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,266
Come to mama.

253
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:47,133
- Manila, meet your partner.

254
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,467
- Hey!
- Bam!

255
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,767
You, come on.

256
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:51,800
Heh, heh, heh.

257
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Yara.
- Oh!

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,834
Thank you, darling.

259
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,233
- Carmen.

260
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,800
Meet your partner.

261
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,166
With Chevy's body,

262
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,767
it's going to be very difficult
for Carmen

263
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,000
to stand on stage
naked like her.

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,333
And you're mine, yay.

265
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:11,467
I keep the best one for me.
Slava.

266
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,200
- Now turning these jocks
into drag queens

267
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
will take every ounce
of charisma,

268
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,033
uniqueness, nerve and talent
that you've got.

269
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,133
So put some muscle into it.

270
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:26,900
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

271
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,433
And may the best woman win.

272
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:34,100
- Yeah!

273
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,934
- Can I hit one out there?
- Nope, no baseball.

274
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,300
No sports today,
you're a lady.

275
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,467
- Yes.
- Oh, really? Doesn't matter.

276
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,834
- [laughing] Yeah.

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
- Sell it.

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,700
Hands on your hips,
hands on your hips, always.

279
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,834
- Hands on my hips.
- Yes, yes, yes.

280
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,834
- Hands on my hips.
I'm liking this shit.

281
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,066
- Yeah, you have, like,
a boner a little bit.

282
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:57,266
- It's a little one?

283
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,533
I think it's 'cause
the air is in there.

284
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,467
[laughing]
- I was like, "Okay, kill it."

285
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,300
It's not the first time
I got a straight guy excited.

286
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,367
- [laughing]

287
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,500
- Oh!

288
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,667
- So the challenge today is
we have to transform

289
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:14,200
these straight jocks
into our drag sisters.

290
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,767
- Yeah, those are gonna be
your tits.

291
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:16,967
- [laughing]

292
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,934
- I hope so.

293
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,667
It's like water polo.

294
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,233
- [gasping] You have to shave.

295
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,233
- I'm not shaving that.

296
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,400
That's my jungle hair over here.

297
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
- Drew, he's afraid

298
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,200
of what are we going to do.

299
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,100
- I have to be a jock
for a second.

300
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
- So now you're gonna play.

301
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,567
- Yes, I just--
I'll work a little,

302
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,133
and I'll play a little,
you know?

303
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,633
- I have a lot of work to do.

304
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,567
- Carmen, are we gonna have to
teach these boys how to tuck?

305
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,467
- I have to.

306
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:50,200
- Have you ever put your balls
up above your penis?

307
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,066
- Ooh.

308
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,934
- There's, like, a cavity
up in your body,

309
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,266
that sometimes
your testicles can--

310
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,934
they go up there
any time you want.

311
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,767
Like, it's a winter cabin
they can go hang out in

312
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,066
if it gets too cold.

313
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:05,967
- I'll show you so you can see
the contours on my body.

314
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm welcoming him into the house
of Carrera.

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,300
The minute you tuck,

316
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,166
the minute you pull that pee-pee
back,

317
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,567
you feel like a woman.

318
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,467
You need to, like,
put your penis away.

319
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:17,800
- Put my penis away.

320
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,867
- Okay.

321
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,333
- So where does the shaft go?

322
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,133
- That's the one that goes
between your legs.

323
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,467
- And you've been doing this
for how long?

324
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,467
- A while now.

325
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,066
- And you're not all
tuckered out?

326
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,500
- Oh, hell no.

327
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,700
- These are my titties.

328
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,800
- Oh, my God.
- Be gentle with them.

329
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,133
- Oh, my God.
They're so soft.

330
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,200
They feel better
than the real thing.

331
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,500
- Slava is flirty, flirty,
flirty.

332
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,233
- I wanna hear about
your first guy kiss.

333
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,333
- My first guy kiss?

334
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,333
Oh, my gosh.

335
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,333
I was 15, he was 26.

336
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,767
He was straight.
Bam!

337
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,867
- No way.
- Yes.

338
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,133
- I respect that.

339
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,667
- Things that come out
of his mouth,

340
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,433
I'm going, like, "Really, dude,
focus right here.

341
00:12:56,433 --> 00:13:01,166
We're trying to make you
a woman, not a husband."

342
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,233
- Hello, hello, hello.

343
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,934
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, darling.

344
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,200
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Ru.

345
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,166
- Hi, Chris.

346
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,767
So Raja,
now what are you doing

347
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,934
that's gonna make you sisters?

348
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,400
- I'm gonna put my little stamp
as far as styling him,

349
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,533
and making him really feel
a little bit more like Raja.

350
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,100
- Do you have any surprises up
your sleeve, Raja?

351
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,066
- Not just yet.

352
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,400
I've gotta, like,
really dive in,

353
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,767
and we're gonna play with
some makeup

354
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,100
and then the surprise will
probably come at the end,

355
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,233
I hope.

356
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,700
I am looked at by the judges
as being someone

357
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,533
who puts on the funny, cool,
fashion-y costumes,

358
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,133
and does a fierce runway.

359
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,633
How do I make this guy

360
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,166
do the same thing that I do?

361
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,166
Dear God,
please help me.

362
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,900
- Carmen Carrera and Chevy.

363
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,767
It's like a car dealership,
isn't it?

364
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:45,967
- [laughing]

365
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,066
- How will we know
that the two of you are sisters?

366
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:52,066
- Well, we're gonna both be
serving body and sex.

367
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,600
- [laughing] Oh.

368
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,967
Well that sounds like
a Carmen Carrera sister.

369
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,266
- Yeah, the one and only
body queen.

370
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,734
- What are you the most
concerned about

371
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:00,867
in this challenge?

372
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,633
- He uses that sexuality.
- True.

373
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,066
- That's a tough one
right there.

374
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,467
- But it's many years
in the making.

375
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,900
- I don't think it's just
about the look.

376
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,834
I have to kind of transfer
that essence of Carmen Carrera

377
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,867
into this guy.

378
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,600
- Hey, Yara.

379
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,667
- Hi.

380
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,633
- Oh, my goodness.
You're shaving him.

381
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:18,667
- Yes.

382
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,467
- Are you shaving Drew all over?

383
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,834
- No, I didn't...
- [laughing]

384
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,567
No, no.
- He doesn't let me.

385
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,100
- What worries you
the most about this?

386
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,166
- I'm not much of a dancer
or anything,

387
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
so getting the footwork down
is really my main concern.

388
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,533
- But you play rugby.

389
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,066
Can we see you do
a little twirl?

390
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,066
You're wearing your heels now.
- Try it. Go, go.

391
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,734
[indistinct]
Hey, hey, whoa.

392
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:38,367
Walk, walk, walk, aah!

393
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,467
- But you know what?

394
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:43,467
I don't see much challenge
there, Yara.

395
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,367
I expect your sister
to have higher heels.

396
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:51,333
I want to see Liz Hurley,
fuck-me pumps on the runway.

397
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,633
- Okay.
- She's gonna reflect on you.

398
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,533
- Yes.
- So you have to call the shots.

399
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,667
- Yes, I will.

400
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,166
- Good luck, you guys.
- Thank you.

401
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,633
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

402
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,667
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hey, Ru.

403
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,600
- You have a sister, don't you?
- Yes.

404
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,967
- Do you get her into drag?

405
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:10,433
- No, she's a butch lesbian, Ru.

406
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,567
- What's your biggest challenge

407
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:14,066
in turning Slava into your
sister?

408
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,133
- Making him concentrate
while we have to work.

409
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,266
- It's focus.

410
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,934
Slava plays water polo.

411
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,367
You have to have focus
in sports.

412
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,200
Help him transfer that focus

413
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,367
into doing drag.

414
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,967
- Hey, Manila.

415
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,667
- Hi, Ru.
- What do you have planned out?

416
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,533
- Well, I'm going to be
putting him in, like,

417
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,767
this little kimono.

418
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,734
- Oh, my.

419
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,066
And will so much body
be showing?

420
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,734
- So much body will be showing.
- Wow.

421
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,133
What's your biggest challenge?

422
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,200
- Fuchsia's kind of a brick.
- Uh-huh.

423
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,900
- So I'm gonna have to
break down her face,

424
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,166
and make her as feminine
as possible.

425
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,200
Attractive manly men,

426
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,533
don't make attractive
drag queens.

427
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,400
Fuck. This is gonna be hard.

428
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,233
<i>- Gather around, everybody.</i>

429
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,467
Tomorrow,
on the main stage,

430
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,400
we will be joined
by our guest judges,

431
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,800
actress and comedian
Margaret Cho...

432
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,100
- All: Ooh!

433
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,734
- And the always cheerful,
Sharon Osbourne.

434
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,200
- Yay!
- Ooh!

435
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,934
- Oh, and one more thing.

436
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:18,333
In addition to the glamorous
looks you've been working on,

437
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,734
you need to style...

438
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,734
cheerleader outfits.

439
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,433
- Oh, okay.

440
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,800
- And then come up with
a fun fight cheer

441
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,100
that supports safe sex.

442
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,667
- [laughing]

443
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,867
Not only walking
on the runway as models,

444
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,433
now we have to cheerleading?

445
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,567
Oh.

446
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,100
- You'll both perform
your cheer tomorrow

447
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,467
on the main stage.

448
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,700
Go team go.

449
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,834
And remember,
don't fuck It up.

450
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,233
- Ready?
- Both: Okay!

451
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,734
- This week's main challenge
is to turn straight jocks

452
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,700
into our drag sisters.

453
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,133
And the twist is,

454
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:01,333
we have to do a cheerleading
routine about safe sex.

455
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,633
- Wrap your dick,
wrap up your dick.

456
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:05,900
- Wrap your dick!

457
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,400
- [laughing] Yes!

458
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,767
- Then we're gonna do the

459
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,900
♪ Safe sex ♪
And we're gonna switch.

460
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,266
- What's up, bitches?
- Oh, my God.

461
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,500
Wow.
This is disturbing.

462
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
♪ Waa waa waa waa ♪

463
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,066
Raja's jock look a mess.

464
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,567
- Yaay!

465
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,467
- I don't know
what the bitch was doing.

466
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,734
But girl,
you don't look that good.

467
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,800
- I don't know about
Raja's sister.

468
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,133
She's supposed to be a heather.

469
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:35,834
I don't know, she kind of looks
like a Sprepper.

470
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,934
It's basically a Sprite mixed
with Dr. Pepper.

471
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,667
It's not necessarily
a good thing.

472
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,433
It's usually, like,
a booger quality.

473
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,433
Like, oh!

474
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:47,100
Like, "That's such a Sprepper."

475
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,066
- It's time for me and Slava to
go to the runway and practice.

476
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,734
Look at the judges.
You give them poses.

477
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:53,767
- Oh, God!

478
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,967
- Keep the balance,
keep the balance.

479
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,133
Alexis Mateo always known
by the "Bam!"

480
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,600
So I'm making him
say it as well,

481
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,333
'cause he better show the judges

482
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,133
that he is part of
the fa-mi-ly.

483
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,400
Bam!
- Bam!

484
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm a drama queen, bitch!

485
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,667
- No, you're not a drama queen.

486
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,567
You're a drag queen,
God damn it.

487
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,066
Come on, say it!
- Bam! Bam!

488
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,266
I'm a drag queen.

489
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,867
- I hope that everything
goes well

490
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,333
and he doesn't show more diva
than me tomorrow.

491
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,834
'cause we're gonna
have a problem.

492
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,433
- Mm-hmm.
- Bam!

493
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,500
- Look at the judges.

494
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Seductive.

495
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,300
You want to fuck the judges.

496
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,400
I wanna fuck You guys.

497
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Yes, I'm here.

498
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,900
Eat it, bitch.
You know what I mean?

499
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,967
Grab your waist.

500
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,567
Right.

501
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,133
Left.

502
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,066
<i>Echa pa lante,</i>
look at the judges.

503
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,133
- I'm looking.

504
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,600
- And then left.

505
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
No, we're gonna do right again.

506
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,834
Left.

507
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm a little worried.

508
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,433
Get him the attitude.

509
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:52,700
- You better not complicate it.

510
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,967
- No, no, no.
- You're gonna regret this.

511
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,200
- I'm scared to go home.

512
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
- Ready, one, two, right foot.

513
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,233
I'll go slower.

514
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,133
Chris in heels,
it's a little funny.

515
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,633
It's not sexy yet.

516
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,266
- I just gotta learn
the count thing.

517
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,734
Are you gonna actually tell me?

518
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,166
- I'm just gonna tell you when.
- Okay.

519
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,467
- I'm gonna be, like,
"Let's go, Chris," all right?

520
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,066
So make sure that you're--
- Or, you mean my stage name.

521
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,300
- Yeah, Enigma.
Sorry, girl.

522
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,800
I know that he has
really good intentions.

523
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,967
But I know that I can only
do so much.

524
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,133
I don't want you to forget this,
'cause it's kind of important.

525
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm just hoping that Chris
remembers the few steps

526
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
that I taught him
in front of the judges tomorrow.

527
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
- Titties up, titties up.
- Titties up.

528
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,233
- When you get here
and you do your twirl,

529
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,667
like, you can look down at your
ass and then look up at them.

530
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,066
- What about my titties,
is that just not cool?

531
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,133
I mean, I love titties.

532
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,233
- No, because I'm not, like,
a titty girl.

533
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,667
I'm like a butt girl.
- [laughing]

534
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,100
- Let's do it again.
- All right.

535
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,066
I only got about two more walks
down here in me.

536
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,400
- All the pain that
you're feeling right now

537
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,767
is the man leaving your body.

538
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,467
You're just becoming more
feminine and more feminine.

539
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,433
- How about my toes
leaving the shoe?

540
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,367
- Yeah.

541
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,433
He's just, like, complaining,

542
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,200
and he's just, like,
"Oh, my God."

543
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,033
And then give us a twirl
to show us body.

544
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,467
No, that's butch.

545
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:09,066
Be, like, really girly, like...

546
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,433
- When you're walking,
like, look at the judges.

547
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,700
- Okay.
- Okay?

548
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,300
- If you catch one of
their eyes, that's good.

549
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,700
- Can I point?

550
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,166
- Ladies don't point unless
they're picking out shoes.

551
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,333
I want those pairs.

552
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,433
- How's this?

553
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:21,500
- Well, don't--

554
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,133
what woman do you know
stands like that?

555
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,467
Oh!

556
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,800
Practice on this line,

557
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,133
by putting one foot
over the other

558
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,667
like you're doing a drug test.

559
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,533
Work the runway, fish!

560
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,567
- Fish?

561
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,767
- And strike another pose.

562
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,433
Matt has a really huge
personality.

563
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,567
Okay, you're gonna strike
a feminine pose.

564
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,867
- Oh, okay.

565
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,133
- Not like you're poppin'
a squat in the woods.

566
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,133
- Okay.
- Okay?

567
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,467
It gets annoying.

568
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,133
We'll work on the poses
when we're not on the runway.

569
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,400
I just want you
to get comfortable with--

570
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,533
I just want you to get
comfortable with the runway.

571
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,567
And if you do this
to me tomorrow,

572
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm going to seriously
hunt you down...

573
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
- All right, all right!
- And kill you.

574
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,333
- I'm just having fun
on the stage, man!

575
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,700
- Okay, okay, okay.

576
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,734
- Does your family know
that you're straight?

577
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:06,367
- [laughing]
Yeah.

578
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,200
My little brother's gay.
- Oh, no way.

579
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,467
- Yeah, yeah.

580
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,567
He's one of those angry
gay people.

581
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,667
- Why?

582
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,767
- He just thinks that
everybody hates him

583
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,300
'cause he's gay or whatever.

584
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
Did you ever do drag
in high school?

585
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
- No, hell no.

586
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,133
I didn't come out
in high school.

587
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,767
I think people knew
that I was gay.

588
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,734
They didn't have the balls
to come and ask me.

589
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,200
I didn't have a sense of pride
in being gay.

590
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,166
- Uh-huh.

591
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,600
'Cause it was still taboo
to you.

592
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,533
- Yeah, that's why I was, like,
really angry at the world

593
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,600
for a little bit.

594
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,367
You feel wrong
for the most of your life.

595
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,066
And then you don't know why
you feel wrong.

596
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,467
And then you just get mad
at people.

597
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:38,900
Like, "why do you make me feel
wrong?" You know?

598
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,533
Well, how old is he now?
- 19.

599
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,066
He's 19 now.
- Oh, he's still really young.

600
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,133
- Just a kid.

601
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,166
- He'll get over all of that.
Trust me.

602
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,600
- I hope so.
- He will.

603
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,233
Once he sees his big brother
in drag.

604
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,500
- It's kind of a motivator
For me to do this, you know?

605
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,734
- Yeah.
He's gonna love it.

606
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,800
- Make sure that you don't eat
anything

607
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,767
that's gonna make you bloated
for tomorrow.

608
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,900
- Okay.

609
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,200
- But you're trying to make him
look like you.

610
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,533
So why wouldn't he be bloated?

611
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,734
- Ooh!

612
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:08,266
- Tell her her mom's bloated.
- You're--

613
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,767
- So we're teaching our sisters
to read.

614
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,166
- It's a natural talent
in a Luzon family, honey.

615
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,333
- You've got the perfect
daughter, Manila.

616
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,633
- Matt is just like Manila.

617
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,734
Completely obnoxious.

618
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:21,133
- Yo, you guys like
my lobster hat?

619
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:25,100
- Manila, meet your cell mate,
Matt.

620
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,500
- Do women really slap tables?

621
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,333
- I just slap tables
all day long,

622
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,066
you don't even know,
for real.

623
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,367
- Good morning.

624
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:37,934
- Challenge day.

625
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,367
We're back into the work room

626
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,967
and it's so much
that has to be done.

627
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,867
- Let's make you into a fish.

628
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:46,900
- I'm nervous as hell.

629
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,967
- No, no, you can do it.
You can do it.

630
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,066
- All right, all right.

631
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,600
- We are teammates, you know?
- All right.

632
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,533
- We need to practice.
Rush. Come on.

633
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,767
- Both:
Ready? You're gay.

634
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,200
- Keep your peeker--
Pecker.

635
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,333
Fuck.
- Pecker.

636
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,500
- What is a pecker?
- Keep your pecker--

637
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,734
- What is a pecker?
- Pecker is your dick.

638
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:01,300
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

639
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,100
- We have the exact same amount
of time that we usually have,

640
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,934
except that this time, we have
to get ourselves in drag

641
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,467
and then a person that has never
been in drag before in drag.

642
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,166
[exhales]
All right. I'm ready for you.

643
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,767
- Whoa.
You're gluing his brows?

644
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,500
- Mm-hmm.
- What's it do?

645
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,800
- It lays them down and then
I can, like, cover them,

646
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,867
and then I can draw them

647
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,734
wherever I want to put
new eyebrows.

648
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,567
The most intimidating part
of this challenge

649
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:25,967
is that it's not just me.

650
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,767
I now have to, like,
completely do an overhaul

651
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,767
on this masculine straight guy.

652
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:35,300
- Ancient Chinese secret.
- Ancient drag secret.

653
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,734
- Did you have people who
came out in high school?

654
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:38,867
In your school,
in Puerto Rico?

655
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,333
- No, I was the only one.

656
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,900
- I had a really hard time
in high school.

657
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,667
I was, like, really close to,
like, being suicidal.

658
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,133
It was, like, left and right.

659
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,567
I couldn't, like,
walk around the school

660
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,066
without being, like,
tormented.

661
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,266
- But you know what,

662
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,100
I went to my ten-year
high school reunion in drag.

663
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

664
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,433
- How was the reception?

665
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,867
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

666
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,367
- We all had a blast together
for the first time in my life.

667
00:23:58,367 --> 00:23:59,400
Like, I had a great time

668
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,667
with people I went to
high school with.

669
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,166
- [laughing]

670
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,066
- So you're legally married?
- Legally, yeah.

671
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:07,133
- So if you move--
- It would be invalid.

672
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,533
New Jersey's the only state
that really gives a lot

673
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,500
of the same rights

674
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,533
that they give
a straight married couple.

675
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,633
- So you're stuck
in the armpit of America

676
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,900
because you're gay.

677
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,567
- I think that straight people
take a lot of things

678
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,834
for granted.

679
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,166
You can settle down
with any girl and have kids

680
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,133
and live the American dream,
but it's, like,

681
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,700
so much harder for gay people
to do that.

682
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,967
- Turn around.
It's not that difficult.

683
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,800
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

684
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,500
When I first saw myself
transformed,

685
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,633
my heart just stopped.

686
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,667
My breath just gasped,
and I was, like, whoa!

687
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,934
I can't even believe this.

688
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:41,266
Oh, my God.

689
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:42,633
- Alexis' jock...

690
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,066
he's a drag queen.

691
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,500
This is your first time?

692
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,667
Mm-hmm.

693
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,834
- We're gonna run out together,

694
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,367
shake your pom pom's like crazy.

695
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,533
Just be, like, aaaah!

696
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,200
And then we stop at the edge
of the stage--

697
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,934
- Oh, we perform on stage?
- Yeah.

698
00:24:57,934 --> 00:24:58,934
- Oh, wait, wait, please.

699
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:00,166
Please just--please don't.

700
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,533
Really, honestly.

701
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,867
Dude, focus!

702
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:03,800
Please!

703
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,467
Like, I'm on the line, here.

704
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,633
- Are you angry at me?

705
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,934
- No, I'm just really,
like, freaking out.

706
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:11,200
- You'll be all right.
Take a deep breath, bro.

707
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,266
- Thank you.

708
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,066

Welcome to the main stage

Welcome back.

- Margaret,
you're Cho beautiful.

723
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
- Thank you.

724
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,100
Well, I was raised
by drag queens,

725
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,333
like some are raised by wolves.

726
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,734
So I know drag.

727
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,066
- Well then,
welcome home sweetheart.

728
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,934
Sharon Osbourne,
the coolest mom ever.

729
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,433
Welcome to the show.

730
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,433
- Thank you, my darling.

731
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,867
- How's Ozzy?

732
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:08,467
- All I can tell you is, Ru,
he absolutely adores you.

733
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,967
- [laughing]
Welcome.

734
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:12,567
This week,
our queens were challenged

735
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:16,934
to turn straight jocks into
their glamorous drag sisters.

736
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:21,066
But first, we asked them to lead
a fun fight cheer

737
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,333
in support of safe sex.

738
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,767
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

739
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:29,066
And may the best woman win.

740
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:33,233
- Both: Whoo!

741
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,734
Divas, divas, here we go!

742
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:36,567
Safe sex is the way to go!

743
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,633
Ooh, you wanna moan?

744
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,533
Ooh, you wanna growl?

745
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,433
Make it safe!
And make us proud!

746
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,266
- I love you.
- And you love me.

747
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,233
- Both:
Safe sex fraternity!

748
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,900
Whoo!

749
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,667
- Safe sex mother fuckers!

750
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,834
- Wrap that dick!

751
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,066
Safe sex, don't get pregnant!

752
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,734
- Both: Ready?
You're gay!

753
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,734
- B-A-R-E!

754
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:58,333
- B-A-C-K!

755
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,567
- Both: No bareback,
no bareback!

756
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,233
No, no, no bareback!

757
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,333
- I need a C!
- C!

758
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,400
- I need an O!
- O!

759
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,300
- Give me an N!
- N!

760
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,533
- How bout a D?
- D!

761
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,967
- Another O!
- O!

762
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,100
- Another M!
- M!

763
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,166
- What's it spell?

764
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,333
- Both: Safe sex!
Woo-hoo!

765
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,433
- All: [laughing]

766
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,633
- Both: Ready?
Let's go!

767
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,967
- Give your back a cleaning!

768
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,433
- Have that rubber
catch that semen!

769
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:27,867
- Give me that W!
- W!

770
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:30,300
- Give me the R!
- R!

771
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,900
- Give me the A!
- A!

772
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,066
- Give me the P!
- P!

773
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,867
- What that spell?

774
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:37,934
- Both: Wrap your dick!

775
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,400
Wrap up your dick!

776
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
Wrap your dick!

777
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,066
Wrap up your dick!

778
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,066
- Both: Hey, hey, you, you!

779
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,767
You need to get a clue!

780
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,600
Be safe, don't chafe!

781
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,100
Your dick will turn dark blue!

782
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,133
Uh-oh, she said,
my pussy's turning red!

783
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,367
- Ooh!

784
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,133
- Both: They'll burn when they
pee.

785
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,066
Protection is the key!

786
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,166
Safe sex!

787
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,567
- [laughing]

788
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,767
- Well, that was short.

789
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,600
[laughing]

790
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,400
- All: [laughing]

791
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,667
- Both: Ready?
Okay!

792
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:23,533
Always wear a condom,
and use a dental dam.

793
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,066
Abstinence is for boogers,

794
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,300
but we love our diaphragm!

795
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,700
- [laughing]
- A diaphragm?

796
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,233
- A what?
A diaphragm!

797
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,433
- A who?

798
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,200
- Both: You can use a diaphragm

799
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,133
with spermicidal lube!

800
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,200
Safe sex!

801
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,734
Whoooooo!

802
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,667
- All: [laughing]

803
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,467
- All right, kids.

804
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,066
We are gonna do us some runway.

805
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:51,300
First up,
Alexis and Avals Mateo.

806
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,100
Sisters in the name of love.

807
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,066
- Those outfits are to die for.

808
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,367
- Some birds did.

809
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,333
-<i> Me and Slava are walking</i>
<i>on that runway</i>

810
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,767
<i>like we are true divas.</i>

811
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,333
<i>He got my style,</i>
<i>he got my walk.</i>

812
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,200
<i>He got my signature move.</i>

813
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,834
-<i> Look at that bum!</i>

814
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:08,900
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

815
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,633
-<i> Unidentified flying asses.</i>

816
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,266
<i>Raja and her sister Enigma.</i>

817
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,400
-<i> Enigma, please.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>

818
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,133
<i>It's the Cheetah Girls.</i>
<i>- It is!</i>

819
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,300
-<i> I know for a fact that</i>
<i>Chris is doing the best job</i>

820
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,467
<i>that he can.</i>

821
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,300
<i>And I hope that</i>
<i>the judges can see that.</i>

822
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,066
-<i> I think Enigma looks</i>
<i>very vulnerable.</i>

823
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:32,567
<i>Her face is vulnerable</i>
<i>but her</i><span style="bodyStyle"> legs</i><i> look like sailors.</i>

824
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:37,800
-<i> Up next, we have Yara</i>
<i>and Drewlita Sofia.</i>

825
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,433
<i>Goldfinger.</i>

826
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,500
-<i> This is real Mandrell sisters</i>
<i>realness.</i>

827
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,900
-<i> Yes.</i>

828
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,200
-<i> We are doing our catwalk,</i>
<i>and I feel so great.</i>

829
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,867
<i>He's doing everything</i>
<i>I taught him.</i>

830
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,867
-<i> Drewlita has that</i>
<i>"don't fuck with me" look</i>

831
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:50,867
<i>on her face.</i>

832
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,233
-<i> She does.</i>

833
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,734
-<i> I think it's real "Madonna</i>
<i>after yoga" look.</i>

834
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,567
-<i> It's Kabbalah Madonna.</i>

835
00:29:55,567 --> 00:30:00,433
<i>Up next, Carmen and Lolita</i>
<i>Cruz-Carrera.</i>

836
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,266
-<i> Jujubee is back.</i>

837
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:04,000
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>and he's serving it.</i>

838
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,633
<i>We're giving a lot of body</i>
<i>right now.</i>

839
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,500
<i>We're giving attitude.</i>
<i>We're giving pretty.</i>

840
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,967
<i>We're definitely representing</i>
<i>Carrera.</i>

841
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,734
-<i> This is just like</i>
<i>the Miss New Jersey Pageant.</i>

842
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,000
-<i> Representing Miss Patterson,</i>
<i>New Jersey.</i>

843
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,533
-<i> She sells sea shells</i>
<i>by the Jersey shore.</i>

844
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:21,667
<i>Last but not least,</i>
<i>the Luzon sisters.</i>

845
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:22,667
<i>Oh!</i>

846
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,166
-<i> Oh, snap it, Lagerfeld.</i>

847
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,567
-<i> Geisha to go.</i>

848
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:29,100
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>just as we practiced.</i>

849
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,233
<i>Except that Matt is really</i>
<i>serving it fiercely.</i>

850
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,800
<i>He's truly a Luzon.</i>

851
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,900
-<i> I think it's murder</i>
<i>on the orient runway.</i>

852
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,100
-<i> I think it's more</i>
<i>Kill Bill 2.</i>

853
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,266
-<i> Kill Bill 2 meets To Wong Foo.</i>

854
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,633
-<i> Memoirs of a gay-sha.</i>

855
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,467
-<i> China dolls.</i>

856
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,066
- Welcome, sisters.

857
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:54,367
Thank you for giving us
something to cheer about.

858
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,800
Now it's time for
the judges' critique.

859
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,834
Let's start with Alexis
and Avals Mateo.

860
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:02,867
Hi, Avals.

861
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,400
Are you chilly up there?

862
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,567
- Chilly?
- Yeah, your nipples are hard.

863
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,667
- Oh, that's 'cause
I'm a little horny.

864
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,333
- [laughing]

865
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,934
- You really embraced
your feminine side.

866
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,667
You're really getting off on it,
aren't you?

867
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,100
- I really, really am.

868
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,667
- You've probably got a stiffy
going on under there somewhere.

869
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,800
- [laughing]

870
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,333
- I think that Alexis
did a great job on the makeup

871
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,400
and the hair.

872
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,066
- I think the cheer was sloppy
at points.

873
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,400
I think because you tried to put
too much into it.

874
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,567
- You have this
family resemblance

875
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,467
that's in the body,
it's in the face.

876
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,734
You were giving me Kardashian.

877
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm keeping up with you.

878
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,066
- Next up, Raja
and her sister Enigma.

879
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,633
- We discovered that we both
have a mutual love

880
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,934
for old movies.

881
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,934
And we thought of maybe
a little bit more

882
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,133
of an old Hollywood glamour.

883
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,266
- What old movie
did you pattern her after?

884
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:02,533
<i>Tarzan?</i>

885
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:03,533
- It feels a little jungle.

886
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:04,567
It felt a little bit more like

887
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:05,967
<i>La Dolce Vita.</i>

888
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,333
- The walk, however.

889
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,166
It's a bit like a sailor.

890
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,166
- You know, I would
have expect Raja to instill

891
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,734
a little bit more of your
ability in Enigma.

892
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,367
- I thought the cheer
was quite athletic.

893
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:22,066
I can't remember what you were
cheering about though.

894
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,400
- Um, about bare backing.

895
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,066
- What does that mean?

896
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,100
- It means when you, um,
are fucking without condoms.

897
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,333
- Okay.

898
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,967
Well, that--see I've learned
something new today.

899
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:34,066
- Which we don't encourage,
we don't encourage.

900
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,233
- No, no, no, no.

901
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,266
Actually, I'm wearing a condom
right now.

902
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:40,367
- [laughing]

903
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,200
- Next up, we've got Yara Sofia

904
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,367
and her sister, Drewlita.

905
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,200
- Did she resist?
- Yes.

906
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
- What did she resist?

907
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,533
- Hair removal, tucking,
dancing, singing.

908
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:54,867
- So you resisted everything?

909
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:57,633
- Well, I'm historically
relatively shy.

910
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,100
So I'm just glad that I got out
here to try something new--

911
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,433
- But you have your sister now.
- Exactly.

912
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:05,834
- So you felt more outgoing once
you were walking the runway?

913
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,600
- Absolutely.

914
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
- I thought the cheer was quite
sweet.

915
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,266
You were, like,
fanning your bums.

916
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,800
- [laughing]
- Thank you.

917
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,767
- Well, you guys look amazing.

918
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,066
You look like Heart,
circa 1982,

919
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,066
you know, right when
they were going disco?

920
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,333
- You did such a beautiful job

921
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,834
giving Drewlita that sort of
Madonna face.

922
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,533
Which I think is fierce.

923
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,467
- And they both have man-hands,
just like Madonna.

924
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:32,066
- Yes.
- [laughing]

925
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:35,667
- Up next, Manila
and her drag sister Fuchsia.

926
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,967
- She's a true Luzon.
- Oh, really?

927
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:42,066
- Yes, this personality
is driving us nuts.

928
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:45,533
- You did an amazing job,
Manila, with the makeup.

929
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:49,433
Because the before and after
is just really incredible.

930
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:53,200
And Fuchsia, you seem to have
embraced the whole process.

931
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,633
- Hey!
- Hey!

932
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,367
- [laughing]

933
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,367
- I love this look.

934
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:01,533
Just giving me that perfect

935
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,734
Hong Kong garden restaurant...

936
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,767
I'm ready to order.
- [laughs]

937
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,533
- Would you date you?

938
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,467
- Yes. Hard.

939
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:12,667
- [laughing]

940
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,066
Up next, Carmen Carrera

941
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,200
and her sister, Lolita Cruz.

942
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,300
Do you feel pretty?

943
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,500
- Yes, absolutely.

944
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,200
I threw a little swagger into my
step be all right.

945
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
- Now Carmen, because
your sister is beefy,

946
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,967
very masculine,

947
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,667
did you ever consider maybe

948
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,066
doing something that sort of
feminized the body

949
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,300
a little bit more?

950
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,700
- You know, I don't care
what kind of body you have.

951
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,300
You know, you can be--
you can do naked.

952
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,200
If I was, you know,
100 pounds overweight,

953
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,867
I would still do my pasties
and get naked.

954
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:43,700
Because that's how much
confidence I have inside.

955
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,934
And I want to bring that out.

956
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:48,266
- From the head up,
there is some similarity.

957
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:51,200
It's just the arms the shoulders
that are still, like--

958
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,333
you know, like...
- [laughs]

959
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,133
You know, He-Man.

960
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,633
- You took care of yourself and
you're like, "Here, sister,

961
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:58,700
"try this on, girl.

962
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,433
Put this on.
You'll look fierce."

963
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,967
You're known for your body,

964
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,300
I know in your head you think
if you're 100 pounds heavier,

965
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,934
you'd still rock it.

966
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:10,567
I don't really buy that.

967
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:15,200
- Now sisters, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

968
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,567
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

969
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,867
the judges and I
will deliberate.

970
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,200
You may leave the stage.

971
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Just between us girls.

972
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,433
Let's start with Alexis
and Avels.

973
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:32,867
- They had a connection.
And I like that.

974
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:36,100
- The pro is, they did work
in synchronicity,

975
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,300
but I didn't understand
3/4 of it.

976
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,633
- Slava might have surpassed
Alexis.

977
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:42,633
- [laughing]

978
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:45,934
- Raja and Enigma.

979
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,433
- Raja is such a beauty.

980
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:52,400
And then you had this big,
strutting bloke.

981
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,300
- I didn't really feel
a sisterly connection.

982
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,667
It was more like a
mother-daughter kind of thing.

983
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,900
- I got, like,<i> Mommie Dearest</i>
in Christina.

984
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,367
Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

985
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,200
- This is one of the bottom two
for me tonight.

986
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,100
- Yara Sofia and her sister
Drewlita.

987
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,533
- Love the outfits.

988
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:13,133
But I didn't think that there
was such a great connection.

989
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,834
- Drewlita, you know, is an
incredible transformation.

990
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,066
- Yeah, she was really pretty.

991
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,300
- I didn't really get a sibling
thing from them.

992
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,433
- Manila and her sister,
Fuschia.

993
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,100
They had a lot of fun with this.
- Mm.

994
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,133
- And Fuschia was a gas.

995
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,867
- Manila and him
were really good together.

996
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,100
You could tell that they were
enjoying each other.

997
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,867
- The biggest transformation
for me was Fuschia tonight.

998
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:36,200
Matt is a big ol' jock.

999
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,433
- Carmen and Lolita
Cruz-Carrera.

1000
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,066
I don't know if she threw Lolita
under the bus.

1001
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,800
Lolita's build was so stocky.

1002
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,433
- It was more like
he was trying to help

1003
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:49,100
his less attractive sister,
you know, get laid.

1004
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,300
- Was Carmen meant
to dress down?

1005
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,834
She has such a magnificent body
on her.

1006
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:58,233
- And that made the awkwardness
of their bodies together

1007
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,900
more pronounced.

1008
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,567
- There are a million tricks up
Carmen's sleeve, you guys.

1009
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,967
- Sure.
- Trust me.

1010
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,800
She looked out for herself
all night.

1011
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,367
- Silence!

1012
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,533
I've made my decision.

1013
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:13,233
Bring back the sisters.

1014
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,367
Welcome back, ladies.

1015
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,767
Now based on
your jock transformations,

1016
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,100
and your presentations
on the main stage,

1017
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,300
I've made some decisions.

1018
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,934
Alexis Mateo.

1019
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,333
- Wait, wait, shh.

1020
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,767
- You were a real player
this week.

1021
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,433
And I thought
I was seeing double.

1022
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:35,934
Double-D.

1023
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:38,066
You're safe.

1024
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,066
- Thank you, guys.

1025
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,900
- [exhales]

1026
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,066
- Manila.

1027
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,867
You served up two China dolls.

1028
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,100
And 20 minutes later...

1029
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
we're still hungry for more.

1030
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,400
Condragulations.

1031
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,066
You are this week's MVP,

1032
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:00,967
and the winner
of this week's challenge.

1033
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:01,934
- Yeah!

1034
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:04,600
That's my girl!

1035
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,567
- You've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas.

1036
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,567
Courtesy of alandchuck.travel.

1037
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,467
And for helping you
with your win,

1038
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:17,100
we are awarding your jock
the same prize.

1039
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,633
- Oh, ho, ho!
Shit! Yeah!

1040
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,767
I'm going on a cruise!

1041
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,500
- Raja.

1042
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
You were off your game.

1043
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,867
And your sister act was
none the better for it.

1044
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:37,467
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1045
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:42,800
- Ru tells me that I have to
lip-synch for my life.

1046
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,133
I couldn't believe it.

1047
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,367
- Yara Sofia.

1048
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,500
You're safe.

1049
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,633
Carmen Carrera.

1050
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:00,233
Your look was a home run.

1051
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:03,533
But you left your sister
sitting on the bench.

1052
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,300
I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.

1053
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,166
- I don't know what to feel
right now.

1054
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:14,633
If I go home,
I'll be upset about it.

1055
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:17,333
I'm just gonna be Carmen
and do what I do best.

1056
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,233
I'm just gonna turn it out.

1057
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,066
- Two queens stand before me.

1058
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,734
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1059
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:29,600
to save yourself
from elimination.

1060
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,533

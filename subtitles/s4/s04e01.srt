- Shut the Cher show down.

165
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,900
Don't nobody do anything Cher
or Cher-adjacent.

Chad Michaels
is first and foremost

169
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:22,700
a celebrity impersonator.

170
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
That's my passion.

171
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,667
Cher has been what I'm most
well-known for.

172
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,467
This is my work outfit, baby.

173
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,667
- Cher comes to her for tips.
- [laughs]

174
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,333
I really do my best
to impersonate her with reality.

175
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,166
Like, you'll never see "ho!"

176
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,834
I will never do that
because she doesn't do that.

177
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,333
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

178
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,734

179
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,300
- I immediately saw Cher,

180
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,700
so I want to see what else Chad
has to offer.

181
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,200
[cheers and laughter]

182
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:54,734
- My name is Sharon Needles,

183
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,433
I'm 29 years old,

184
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,667
and I'm from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

185
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,200
I look spooky,
but I'm really nice.

186
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
At least for now.

187
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,767
- My first impression
of Sharon Needles

188
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,200
was "Wow, what a whack job."

189
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
- Yes, the princess.
I'm the queen.

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
- The three words that would
describe Sharon Needles

191
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,834
are "beautiful," "spooky,"
and "stupid."

192
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,133
- Ow!

193
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,700
Eat it.

194
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,266
My name is Latrice Royale.

195
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,333
39 years of age.

196
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,734
- Hi, I'm Willam.
- Latrice.

197
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:26,934
- I'll hold your bag for you.

198
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:27,967
- Oh, I know you will.

199
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,800
[whoops]

200
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,934
Home team, home team.

201
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,133
- Miss thing came painted.

202
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,500
She had stones on her face,

203
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,166
and she was giving me all that.

204
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,266
- [delighted exclamation]

205
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:41,066
Latrice Royale is large
and in charge.

206
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,400
Chunky yet funky.

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,567
Wow.

208
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,934
Bold and beautiful, baby.

209
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,266
Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,066
Girl, the shade,
the shade of it all.

211
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,367
- The season four family.

212
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,667
- Look at this here, honey.

213
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,600
[cheers and applause]

214
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,700
- I want to know if I'm
the oldest bitch in the cut.

215
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,934
- You have to be.

216
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,166
[laughter]

217
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
[sirens]

218
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,233
[exclaiming variously]

219
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,166
- Girl, you've got she-mail.

220
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,066
[electronic sizzle]

221
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:14,066
We are living
in desperate times.

222
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,367
Birds falling from the sky,

223
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:19,467
dead fish fouling the sea,

224
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:25,133
once-fertile areas becoming
dusty, dried-up wastelands...

225
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,600
and that was just my last visit
to the lady doctor.

226
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,500
[laughter]

227
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
This is a test...

228
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,433
this is only a test...

229
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,333
to find out which one
of my girls

230
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,734
has the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

231
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:44,066
to snatch the title of America's
next drag superstar.

232
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,100
You are the hope
for future generations

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,667
of glamazons everywhere.

234
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,467
Ladies, tighten your tucks.

235
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:56,066
This is the beginning
of the rest of your life.

236
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,800
[progressively quieter]
Life... life...life...life...

237
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,233
life... life...life...life...
life...

238
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,066
[laughter]

239
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,967
[cheers and applause]

240
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:07,133
- Hello, hello, hello!

241
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,500
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

242
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,600
[cheers and applause]

243
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,834
Now, enjoy this moment.

244
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:18,500
Because it won't last for long.

245
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,567
Now, you've signed on
for a competition

246
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:26,166
that requires severe stamina
and devastating acts of beauty.

247
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,533
But if you dream big
and play to win,

248
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,633
it will all be worth it.

249
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,400
In addition to winning the title

250
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,066
of America's
next drag superstar,

251
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,633
the champion
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

252
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:44,500
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,

253
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,867
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,

254
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:52,367
and headline
Logo's Drag Race Tour,

255
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:56,233
featuring Absolut Vodka:
cocktails perfected.

256
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,266
But wait, there's more.

257
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,233
- More?

258
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,266
- America's next drag superstar

259
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:06,433
will walk away
with a cash prize of...

260
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
$100,000.

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,967
[cheers and applause]

262
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,533
- Oh, my god.

263
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,834
- When I heard $100,000,

264
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,767
I just wanted
to just pee on the floor

265
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,400
and start doing flip-flops.

266
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,166
- That's the good news.

267
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,133
But here's the bad news.

268
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,700
- Oh, here we go.
- Okay.

269
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,166
- You may need to spend
that prize money quickly

270
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,700
because, according
to the Mayan calendar,

271
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,633
2012 is the year the world ends.

272
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,967
This week,
you'll need to survive

273
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:48,767
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.

274
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,467
[distorted voice]
The Rupocalypse.

275
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:57,133
[cheers and applause]

276
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,000
- Bring it on, bring it on!

277
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,066
- Oh, wait a minute.

278
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,333
Somebody's missing.

279
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,300
- No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,166
- Somebody is missing.

281
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,133
- 13, 13.
- 13, it's complete.

282
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,967
- I know.

283
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,834
Oh, pit crew.

284
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,900
[cheers and applause]

285
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,900
- Oh, my god.

286
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,734
- I'm sitting on that box,
it ain't opening.

287
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:23,834
- I'm going to kick that box.

288
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,266
- All right, boys,
let me see what you got.

289
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,800
- Hallelu, I'm back, bitches!

290
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,900
[scattered groans and applause]

291
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,233
Yes!

292
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,967
I'm back, bitches.

293
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,066
- Oh, hell to the no.

294
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,767
It's time to make room
for new queens.

295
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:51,834
- New queens?

296
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:52,867
- Yes, ma'am.

297
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,066
- Well, what about you, Ru?

298
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,266
- Oh, bitch.

299
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,600
Oh, you know what...

300
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
[laughter and chatter]

301
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,066
Pit crew,

302
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,400
take this box out back,

303
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,667
throw in a rabid honey badger...

304
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,467
- Yes!
- Work!

305
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:10,467
- And set it on fire!

306
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,467
[cheers and applause]

307
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,633
- What about my money!

308
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,600
Hallelu!

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,066
- Bye.

310
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,734
- Hallelu. Hallelu.

311
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,567
Hallelu, love you, Hallelu.

312
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,800
Let that be a lesson
to all of you.

313
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,533
My show, my rules.

314
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,734
Now, are you ready
for your close-up?

315
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,800
[cheers and applause]

316
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:39,767
- Today we have
our photo challenge,

317
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,867
and RuPaul said that we should
be ready for the Rupocalypse.

318
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm really, really excited
to see what's gonna happen.

319
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,300
- Hello, Chad Michaels.

320
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,500
- Hi, Ru.

321
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,867
- I want you to meet
our favorite photographer,

322
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:52,967
Mike Ruiz.

323
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,266
Now, he's here to shoot

324
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:56,266
your totally toxic photo spread.

325
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,433
- Okay.

326
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:00,533
- Now, the pit crew
will be using their hoses

327
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,133
to spray you
with hazardous waste.

328
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:07,834
All of this while you spin
around in this toxic dump.

329
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,233
- I'm a soldier and I'm ready.

330
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,500
- All right.

331
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,100
- I want the queens
to embody the apocalypse,

332
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,433
but maintaining,
like, a lot of beauty

333
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,433
and fashion sensibility.

334
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:20,066
- Think Karen Silkwood, darling.

335
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,066
[camera flashes]

336
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,066
- Uh-oh.

337
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,066
- Electric storm.

338
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,166
- Find your li--
- Careful.

339
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,300
- Today just threw me
off balance.

340
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,266
And I was a little bit wobbly,

341
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,600
but I got through it,
got my bearings.

342
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,166
- Play to the camera.

343
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,333
- That queen is poison.

344
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,900
Dida Ritz.

345
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
- Beautiful, yes.

346
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Give me, like,
crazy body shapes.

347
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,567
- You are a survivor, darling.

348
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,800
Grace Jones, darling.

349
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,667
- Beautiful.

350
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,500
- Give us toxic shock. Yes.

351
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,667
- Oh, beautiful.
To the camera, to the camera.

352
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,300
- Whoa!
- Oh.

353
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,066
You're traveling back in time.

354
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,166
- Back in time, darling.

355
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,367
- Kenya has such
a beautiful face,

356
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,900
but she does this really weird
thing with her mouth.

357
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,433
Her mouth is, like, wide open,
like she's trapping flies.

358
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,100
- Give it to Puerto Rico!

359
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,367
Beautiful.

Milan, find the camera.

361
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
- Don't cover your face.

362
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't cover your face too much,
thank you--hold on!

363
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,834
- Ooh!

364

00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:25,934
- Hi, Ru.

369
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,800
- Did I meet you
at the free clinic?

370
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,266
- I think so.

371
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,800
I quit going.

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,834
It's so expensive.

373
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,400

374
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,667

And I'm like, "damn."

383
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,734
- Queen down!

384
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:57,767
- I couldn't let my fall
be the death of me.

385
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,066
- End of the world glamour.
That's right.

386
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,066

out of your face a little bit.

391
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,734
I want to see
that gorgeous face.

Yes, but beautiful.

You're not afraid,
you're giving me beauty.

- Aftershock.

395
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,367
Glow, baby, glow.

396
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,533

00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,433
a 300-pound Latino here
in a second.

402
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,533
- Oh, man,
she said "300-pound Latino."

403
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,133
Sharon Needles.

404
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,700
She creeps me the fuck out.

405
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,367
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, my God.

406
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,500
I feel like I need
to pray the rosary

407
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,734
when I'm talking to you.

408
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,834
It was hard to have
a conversation and not cringe.

409
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,333
- Girl, look what this duct tape
did to me.

410
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,667
- Ooh, you did get
a little rug burn there,

411
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,233
didn't you, mama?

412
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,266
- The duct tape for what?

413
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,767
- I taped my titties up today...

414
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:05,800
- Oh.

415
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,066
- And because I
was in it for so long,

416
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,500
and it was pain--
I just ripped it off.

417
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,633
- Oh, my god, wait, come here.

418
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,667
- Look.

419
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,600
- You know, the stakes are high,
but damn.

420
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,400
- Give me all
of your Princess fierceness.

421
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,533
- I think the pit crew
just shot on your chest.

422
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,066
Princess of the apocalypse.

423
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,934

Make it severe.

Uh-huh.

There's a hole in your ozone.
Now fill it.

438

- Give me beauty face.

439
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,200
Madame LaQueer
was giving me comedy face

440
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,266
when I really wanted
high-fashion face.

441
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,133
Give me beauty.

00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,166
- The last cover of<i> O Magazine.</i>

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,767
It burns so good.

444

Yes, back to the camera.

448
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:10,934
A little sexier.

449
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,300
- I don't do photo shoots.

450
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,867
I don't like 'em.
I don't never know what to do.

451
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,700
I feel awkward and just, like,
"What do you want me to do?"

452
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,567
- Face-fuck the camera, Latrice.

453
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:19,567

459
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,166
- Were those your underwear?

460
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,934
- Wait a minute,
are those your panties?

461
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,533
- Ooh, yes.
- Keep spraying her.

462
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,700
- They're artificially
inseminating her

463
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,834
with that toxic waste.

464
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,533

As soon as I walked in
and saw some body splatters

00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,967

I'm like,

468
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,700
"Yes!
Some of these bitches fell."

469
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,934
Shoot me.

470
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,433
- Release the kraken.

471
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:53,834

- [laughs]

480
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,734
- It was a total shocker

481
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,467
to see how these girls looked
as boys.

482
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,533
- Oh, my god, the princess.
I was like,

483
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,467
"Dude, you look
like a construction worker."

484
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,066
Latrice...she went from looking
like Aretha Franklin

485
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,834
to Biggie Smalls.

486
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,734
- Everybody's so tiny
without shoes and hair.

487
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:29,600
Y'all don't look
like such a threat no more.

488
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,800
- [laughs]

489
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,066
- Kiss my ass.
- Ooh!

00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,367
Now, wait a minute,
let's all get along.

491
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,734
There's no fighting.

492
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:38,533
- Willam is getting
on my nerves.

493
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,734
Shut up, bitch,
and just go back in that box

494
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,667
where Shangela
popped out of and...leave.

495
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,066
- I just want to say
that I love everyone,

496
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,667
and can we all just get along?

497
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,667
- Shut up.

498
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,667
- Oh, what?

499
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,166
- She wants to get along
with everybody.

500
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,300
I don't know.
- Oh.

501
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,133
- Every one of you.

502
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,533
I love you all.

503
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,300
The first day,
at least just try to get along.

504
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,133
And wait till a bitch
steals something of yours

505
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,266
or sabotages you,
and then you can wreak.

506
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,567
But let's not walk in here
like you own the shit.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,734
- They brought us
to this old hotel

540
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,166
in the middle of a sketchy area.

541
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,433
And I'm like,
"What are they gonna do?"

542
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:06,900
- Ladies, I've invited you
to this godforsaken place

543
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,066
for this week's main challenge.

544
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:12,600
It's here that you will scavenge
among the ruins

545
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
to put together
a fabulous outfit

546
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,333
that screams
post-apocalyptic couture.

547
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,367
Now, you can use your own wigs,
undergarments, and shoes,

548
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,467
but the rest has to be looted.

549
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,066
Now, you're probably wondering,

550
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:32,066
"Ru, where am I going to get
all these materials?"

551
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,567
[laughs]

552
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,166
Well, you know what they say...

553
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,567
only three things will survive
the Rupocalypse:

554
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,433
Cockroaches,

555
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,433
Cher...

556
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,567
- Amen.

557
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,567
[laughter]

558
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:49,300
- And drag queen zombies!

559
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,633
- What?

560
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:51,767
[doors creaking ominously]

561
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,800
[snarling and groaning]

562
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,867
- The zombies
were scary as hell.

563
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,867
They got, like, guts coming out
and eyes popping out.

564
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,233
I'm like, mm-mmm, no, ma'am.

565
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,300
- When I saw the zombies comin'
after me,

566
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,266
I was about to hit it.

567
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,834
- [snarls]

568
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:16,100
- All right, you've got three
minutes to grab what you can.

569
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,967
And avoid being eaten alive.

570
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:22,934
Gentlemen, start your engines.

571
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,166
And may the best woman live.

572
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,300
[whimpers]

573
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,567
[zombies groaning]

574
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,867
- Give it, bitch!

575
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,700
- So I'm running around
in between these zombies

576
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,734
and I realize that they're
former competitors

577
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,200
from competitions past.

578
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,166
Shannel, Venus,
Morgan McMichael's, Delta Work.

579
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:52,133
- I got to see Akashia, Raven,
Pandora Boxx, Ongina.

580
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:53,734
- Drop it, bitch.

581
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:56,533
- Oh, maybe some--oh, oh, yeah,
you're not a zombie.

582
00:22:56,533 --> 00:23:00,600
For a quick second, I thought
Chad Michaels was a zombie.

583
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,100
It's just that Halloween mask
of a face that she has.

584
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,633
- Mine.

585
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,066
- Give me that, give me that,
give me that.

586
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,266
No, no, no, no, no.

587
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,567
Bitch, bitch, you crazy.

588
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,266
I'm from new York, motherfucker.

589
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,300
- Oh, well, of course, a corset.

590
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,633
- Girl!

591
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,533
- I'm looking
for anything sparkly,

592
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,500
anything structured,
anything that I can glue

593
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,800
onto a costume that I create,
and then, after that,

594
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,333
I just start
grabbing everything.

595
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,533
- Sorry, girls.
- [screeches]

596
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,500
- Oh! Hi.

597
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,867
Oh, you're drop dead gorgeous.

598
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,433
Ooh, I dig the look.

599
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,600
Oh, no, honey, I'm on your side.

600
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,300
- When I saw the zombies
and then Sharon Needles,

601
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,433
I thought she probably felt
like she was at home.

602
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,533
- God, it's like
a family reunion.

603
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,367
Hey, sorry, sis.

604
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,100
- [screams]

605
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,300
Black people don't stand there

606
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,400
while zombies
are coming at them.

607
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,767
They run, bitch.

608
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:55,600
[screaming]

609
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:06,967
[snarling and growling]

610
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,300
[indistinct yelling]

611
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,433
[objects clattering]

612
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:13,467
- [screaming]

613
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,433
No, no!

614
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,533
[screams]

615
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,734
Oh, Hallelu!

616
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,266
Oh, Hallelu!

617
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,066
[munching sounds]

618
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:26,066
[emergency alarms sounding]

619
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,066
- Welcome back, girls.

620
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,333
[cheering]

621
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,667
- We get back to the workroom,

622
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:38,367
and there's more supplies
to help us with our outfits.

623
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,266
And everybody just went off.

624
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:42,834
- Can we flip this over?

625
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:43,867
- Uh-uh-uh.

626
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,533
- I grabbed it.

627
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:50,400
- We're like drag queen savages
who've been locked up.

628
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,900
We were just tearing each other
apart to get in these boxes.

629
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,066
- That shit's mine!
Everything in here is mine.

630
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:57,066
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.

631
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,900
- Thank god I'm good at math.

632
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,100
One small corset
plus another small corset

633
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,133
equals one fat-ass
corset, bitch.

634
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,066
[laughter]

635
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,367
[hammering]

636
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,600
- Get it, Lashauwn, get it.

637
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,200
- Going to break
that motherfucker.

638
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
- So Ru tells us
that we have to make

639
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,867
a "post-apopaloctic" outfit,

640
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,400
and I don't know
what that means.

641
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,166
It's the end of the world.

642
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,500
I sew for a living.

643
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,867
And I can't go down the runway
lookin' a fool.

644
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,500
- Yay, I got it.

645
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,300
- Lashauwn thinks he's Magellan,

646
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,734
splitting the earth in half
or something.

647
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:40,066
- I don't think art historians
would appreciate that.

648
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:43,600
- I don't know what she's doing.

649
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,667
Lashauwn might be going home.

650
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,934
- Hello, hello, hello.

651
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:51,967
all: Hi.

652
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,400
- Let's get this
end-of-the-world party started.

653
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,834
Hi, Princess.

654
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,100
Wow, what do we have here?

655
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,300
- I'm kind of going
for Rupocalypse

656
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,800
meets<i> Black Swan</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
meets the princess.

657
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,367
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

658
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:08,166
- How does this say
"end of the world"?

659
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,800
- Well, it's
kind of armor.

660
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,934
Like, if a ballerina

661
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,967
were preparing
for, you know, a comet.

662
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,467
- Mmm.

663
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:19,500
But I'm looking
for post-apocalyptic couture,

664
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
<i>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.</i>

665
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,533
- So after the comet
has landed, then?

666
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,533
- Yes.

667
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,700
- Okay, I got you.

668
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,800
I'm definitely nervous

669
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,066
about how much time
we have left.

670
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:31,767
I just need to rethink and redo.

671
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:32,867
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

672
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,300
- Okay, cool.
- I can't wait.

673
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,266
- Thank you.
- All right.

674
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,266
Well, Sharon Needles.

675
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,266
- Hi, Ru.

676
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,300
- Wow. Tell me about this.

677
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,233
- I'm kind of going
for a Linda Hamilton,

678
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,633
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
trapped under the city

679
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:50,367
because of an impending
nuclear dust cloud, and--

680
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:51,500
- Now, I love all that,

681
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,734
but how are you
going to make that read

682
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,333
on the main stage?

683
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,633
- I am a little nervous.

684
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm worried that the judges

685
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,100
aren't going to quite
get the look, but...

686
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,967
to get anywhere
in this competition,

687
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,100
you got to take a risk.

688
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,367
- I noticed you have a Tammy
Faye Bakker tattoo on your arm.

689
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,333
- I do.

690
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,500
She was a huge idol to me
as a kid.

691
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,867
I didn't even know
she was selling Christianity.

692
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,266
I thought
she was selling me makeup.

693
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,133
- [laughs]

694
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,633
All right, I'm going to let you
get back to work, okay?

695
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,900
- Okay, thank you.

696
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,967
- Lashauwn Beyond.

697
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,066
- Hi, Ru.

698
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,333
- What do we have here?

699
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,400
- Well, this is just a top.

700
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,500
And that's my hair.

701
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,633
I'm gonna make it
look explosive.

702
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:26,900
- That's your hair?

703
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,767
- Yes.
- Wow.

704
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,066
- I want to dye it,

705
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,066
but I'm still trying
to be couture and pretty.

706
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,834
- So the silhouette is gonna
be a traditional silhouette,

707
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:38,266
where it's a bustier
and a full bottom.

708
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,266
- I'm not too sure yet.

709
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,934
- You're not sure yet?

710
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,900
You know, there's $100,000
at stake here.

711
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,166
- I know.

712
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,700
- And you don't seem too worried
about the time here.

713
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,133
- I am, I am, I am.

714
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,667
- Huh.
Well, time is running out...

715
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,266
- You're right.
- For all of us.

716
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:53,233
- I know.

717
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,066
- You've got
a lot of work to do,

718
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,500
and there's $100,000
on the line.

719
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,200
- Stop reminding me. Oh, my god.

720
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,133
- Yeah, so...
- It's making me sweat.

721
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,400
- I'm not finished,

722
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,433
so I'm really feeling a certain
type of way.

723
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,467
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

724
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,633
Oh, Lord.

725
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,066
- You have got
to make it happen.

726
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,667
- I will.
- All right, thanks, Lashauwn.

727
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,433
- Take care.

728
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:14,600
- Jiggly Caliente.

729
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,633
- Hey, mama.

730
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,867
- May I call you Jiggly?

731
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,400
- Of course, mama,
everything jiggles.

732
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,567
- [laughs]

733
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,633
Now, tell me about this
post-apocalyptic couture.

734
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:28,533
- This is my<i> Escape from New</i>
<i>York</i><span style="bodyStyle"> post-apocalyptic outfit.</i>

735
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:29,467
- Ah.

736
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,567
- So I need my solar panel
pieces

737
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,266
to make my lights light up.

738
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:36,934
- I don't see a real dress.

739
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,900
- I'm gonna wear a corset.

740
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,767
And I'm finishing that up
with some more...

741
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,066
garbage.

742
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:47,967
- All right, listen.

743
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,066
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

744
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:50,300
- Yes, mama.

745
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,867
- So you just bring it.

746
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,500
- I will, definitely.

747
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,700
- Alisa.

748
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,867
- Hi, Ru, how are you?

749
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,066
- Hey,<i> mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Now, what do we have here?

750
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,233
- This is what I will be wearing
after the Rupocalypse.

751
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:01,367
- [laughs]

752
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,300
You are a breastplate girl,
aren't you?

753
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,333
- It's basically a swimsuit
with some titties on it.

754
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,867
- Hey.
- Hello.

755
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,900
- Now, you know
that the judges are...

756
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,333
let's just say they're
a bunch of bitches.

757
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,567
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?

758
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:14,633
- Oh, I'm so ready.

759
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,467
I'm sure that they're gonna
love it.

760
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:18,500
- Listen, you've got to bring
your game.

761
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,734
- Oh, I'm doing it, Ru.

762
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,200
- All right, get back to work.
- All right, Ru.

763
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,867
See you later.

764
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,967
- Latrice Royale.

765
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:26,200
- Well, hello, Ru.

766
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,934
- Sounds like a gorgeous
after-dinner cocktail, yes.

767
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,266
- Sweet and delicious.

768
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,233
- All right, honey.
Ooh, you're making me thirsty.

769
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:34,700
Now, listen, I've lived
a long time,

770
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,133
and I've had those years
where it felt like

771
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,834
it was the end of the world
as we know it today.

772
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:40,834
- Yes.

773
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,600
- What was your end-of-the-world
moment?

774
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,767
- Really, you really
want to know?

775
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:45,767
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,266
- Um...when I went to prison.

777
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:50,100
I went to prison.

778
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,166
Um, I made some stupid mistakes,

779
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,467
and I got 18 months in, uh--
in the hole.

780
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:58,633
And during that period,
I lost my mom.

781
00:29:58,633 --> 00:29:59,900
- Mmm.

782
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,600
- And those were my worst two
fears come true.

783
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,633
That was a dreadful,
tragic year for me.

784
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,800
I couldn't even go to my
mother's funeral.

785
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,166
It was the most
degrading experience

786
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,066
I've ever had in my life.

787
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,867
But I'm a survivor,

788
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm a fighter,
and I persevered

789
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,767
through triumph,
you know what I mean?

790
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:19,734
- Yeah.

791
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,100
- I had a plan when I got out.

792
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,600
And my community
came to my rescue.

793
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,633
They had a "Get Latrice Royale

794
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,400
back on her feet
and on the stage" benefit.

795
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,533
- Wow.

796
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:29,500
- And it worked.

797
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,233
Now I'm on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

798
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,200
living my dream.

799
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,433
- I love it.

800
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,467
All right, kiddo.
Get back to work.

801
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,266
- Thank you, sweetie.
- All right.

802
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,934
All right, ladies, gather
'round.

803
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:45,000
Now, tomorrow, you'll make your
doomsday debut

804
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,600
on the main stage,
where we'll be joined

805
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,767
by our extra-special guest
judge,

806
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,400
one of my best girlfriends...

807
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,300
the mistress of the dark,
Elvira, will be here.

808
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,567
[cheers and applause]

809
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,600
- I'm so excited, I can't even
put it into words.

810
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,734
She's my idol since I was five
years old.

811
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,567
- Ladies, the human race

812
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,900
depends on you for the survival
of drag.

813
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,967
But if you fail, it's not the
end of the world.

814
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,567
Oh, wait a minute, it is.

815
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,333
So don't fuck it up. Bye.

816
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,066
all: Bye.

817
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,100
- Good morning.

818
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,400
Yay.

819
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,600
- Mama, what a mess.

820
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
- This is a freakin'
disaster area.

821
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,967
- Today is runway day.

822
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,133
It is elimination day.

823
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:40,066
It is all getting very real,
bitches.

824
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,166
- Someone's going home
today, girls.

825
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,367
- So, Lashauwn, how you feeling
about your look?

826
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,533
Is it coming along?

827
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,400
- To be honest with you,
I really don't know.

828
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,567
- What was Ru's feedback?

829
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,834
- I think she was really...

830
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,400
hinting that it wasn't enough.

831
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
- Uh-huh.

832
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,266
- You want to impress her.

833
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,233
- Absolutely.

834
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,066
- And I don't feel like I did.

835
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,333
- It's coming together.
It's gonna be fine.

836
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,800
Lashauwn is a little bit
on edge.

837
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,533
But you got to put the rooter
to the tooter at this point.

838
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:07,967
You've got to just sell it.

839
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,934
You crazy and creative
and outside the box.

840
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,066
You're always "beyond."

841
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,633
- I know you trying to let me
have it, too.

842
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:14,834
- No, well, as far as the looks
and the way you look,

843
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:19,867
it doesn't get any better
than this.

844
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,166
- Thank you.
- Okay, you better do it, honey.

845
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,467
- Talk to me, boo.
How you feeling?

846
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,767
- About the challenge?
- Yeah.

847
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,967
- Feel like everything
will be fine.

848
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,066
I just got to work it out.

849
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,233
- Well, you know, I'm a little
nervous,

850
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,600
but I think it's going
to be fine,

851
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,533
and I think that my mom
is going to be really happy

852
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,266
to see this, so...

853
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,300
- In 2007, I lost my mom,

854
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,266
and it was a rough year.

855
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,367
- If you don't mind me asking,
um, how did she pass away?

856
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:53,300
- My mom had an aortic aneurysm.

857
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,066
She had complications after
surgery.

858
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:59,500
And...she just...went down.

859
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,633
- What was your relationship

860
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:01,700
like with your mom?

861
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,200
- My mom was always there.

862
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,066
But me being a drag queen was,

863
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,400
like, one of the biggest

864
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,700
arguments we've had, 'cause she

865
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,533
never understood why I wanted
to do it so much.

866
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:13,266
The last few months that she
was alive, she did understand.

867
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,734
I was able to tell my mom
everything.

868
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,633
I'm angry.

869
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:19,834
When everything was
on the table,

870
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:25,400
I had three months with my mom
and...three months?

871
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,300
Like, damn.

872
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,867
- Your mother is here.

873
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,867
She's here...you know, and

874
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:35,834
just--just do what you need
to do and bring it.

875
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,834
- Are you nervous at all?

876
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:37,967
- Wait, are you trying
to read me

877
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,867
and tell me I should be nervous?

878
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,734
- Nah, it's cute for, like,
pirate couture.

879
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,767
- I changed my outfit last
night,

880
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:48,233
but today I'm feeling really
nervous about it.

881
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,934
- Are you upset that you had to
change your outfit?

882
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,066
- Ru just didn't like it.

883
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,166
She wasn't feeling it,

884
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,900
so I had to go more
post-apocalypse with it.

885
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,467
I was just so in my head about
it, about her being like...

886
00:33:58,467 --> 00:33:59,667
"Nope," so I was like, "I'm just

887
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,767
"gonna--fuck it, I'm just

888
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:01,800
gonna change it all."

889
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,066
I took a risk in my look and I'm

890
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:06,600
freaking out, because if you

891
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,667
mess up, you go home.

892
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,633
- Okay, I'm going in on this
bitch.

893
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:14,900
- All right.

894
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,967
- You got an instant facelift
with this, dahling.

895
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,233
- What the fuck is that
on her head?

896
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,600
- I don't know what that is,
girl.

897
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,867
- The weakest out of everybody,

898
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,934
I would say, is Sharon Needles.

899
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,600
Sharon's outfit looks more like

900
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,066
a brown tube sock that she just
stretched out.

901
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,333
Looks like she got it at a
discount costume store.

902
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,934
She's not at that point, right
now, to compete, so, if

903
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,300
anything, I feel like she's

904
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,433
gonna be the first one
to go home.

905
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:42,767
- Can I just tell you, like,

906
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,066
I'm so glad that you're here?

907
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,467
- I'm so glad you're here, too.

908
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:46,633
- No, because I don't know

909
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,934
anybody else who does your drag.

910
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:49,900
- Right.

911
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,166
- You know, and I know that

912
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,300
some of the other queens are

913
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,066
just like, "Why is she here,
she's a freak."

914
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,066
- Really?

915
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,500
Well, they can think all they
want.

916
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,867
There's a million kinds of drag.

917
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:01,433
And it's not just being a fishy,
annoying girl.

918
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,467
- Yep.

919
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,467
- I think some of the girls

920
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,834
here, particularly the beauty

921
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,600
queens, might be looking at me

922
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,066
as just a freak.

923
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,900
And I want to show them that I

924
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,934
have everything that it takes
to win this competition.

925
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,233
And more.

926
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,967
- You are exactly the type
of guy that I go for too.

927
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,300
- Oh, stop it.

928
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,867
- Like, that whole, like, meth
look, like, that's...

929
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,300
- "Meth look."
- [laughs]

930
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,333
- Only I could take that
as a compliment.

931
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,533
- Have either of you ever been,

932
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,734
like, arrested or...?

933
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:31,667
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, yeah.

934
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,266
Um, I have a DUI.

935
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,567
The day I got my call to come

936
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,767
here is the--my last day that I
was--I was on probation.

937
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,066
- Really?

938
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,900
- Uh-huh, so it was like--that
was such a blessed day.

939
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,367
Over the last year I've been
dealing with a DUI.

940
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,333
It's just been such a struggle
for 15 months.

941
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,934
I've been without being able to
drive.

942
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:49,734
It's hard for me to keep a
regular job.

943
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,100
They arrested me in drag.

944
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,767
- No!
- Biggest fear ever.

945
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:53,734
- Oh, okay, I thought--

946
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,266
- In handcuffs, in full paint,

947
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,900
full body, everything.

948
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,934
- I kind of would like that,
though.

949
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:58,967
- No.

950
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,133
They made me undress in front of

951
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,367
a room full of people
they had arrested.

952
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,834
Like, nobody would touch me.

953
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:04,667
They ruined my life
for 15 months,

954
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,200
but it's over now, and my life
is about to change.

955
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,633
I'm ready for the whole country
to know who Alisa Summers is,

956
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,100
and I hope they're ready for me.

957
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,066
- I just feel like my stuff
needs more.

958
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:18,467
- I'm worried that they're not
gonna get it.

959
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,767
Honestly, I think you better

960
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,133
create a really good story
for it.

961
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,066
- Okay, what I'm gonna say is,
<i>"Escape from New York--"</i>

962
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,500
ooh, shit, it's falling apart.

963
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,533
- Yeah, that's not good, either.
- Yeah.

964
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,233
- Jiggly's costume is a hot
mess.

965
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:33,300
It's all hot glue and scissor
work.

966
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,233
It's just like an explosion
of aluminum foil.

967
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,500
- Baked potato couture.

968
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,400
- You look like you're ready to
bake at 350.

969
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,066
[laughter]

970
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,633
[applause]

971
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:07,166
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

972
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,800
Well, look what the zombies
dragged in.

973
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,934
Michelle Visage, you're back and
better than ever.

974
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:16,467
- Don't you know it, my lovely
lady in red.

975
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,867
- Mike Ruiz, I'd stop the world
and melt with you, darlin'.

976
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,700
- Oh, here we go again, Ru.

977
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,066
- [laughs]

978
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,633
Sometimes it's champagne,

979
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,567
sometimes it's pretzels
and beer,

980
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,266
but Santino's still here.

981
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,700
[laughter]

982
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,233
- And the eternal beauty,

983
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:38,066
mistress of the dark, Elvira.

984
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,734
- [gasps] Me?

985
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:40,867
- Hey, girl, you're gonna put

986
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,500
somebody's eyes out
with those things.

987
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,934
- [gasps] I hope it's not yours.

988
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:44,967
- [laughs]

989
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,300
Now, this week I asked our

990
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,066
queens to rise from the glittery

991
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,233
ashes and blow us away with

992
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:53,834
their post-apocalyptic couture.

993
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,133
Are you ready to see what's on

994
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,333
the other side?

995
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,800
- Bring it.
- Yeah.

996
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
- Gentlemen, start your engines,

997
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,066
and may the best woman win.

998
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,700
- First up, Willam.

999
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,633
- Not Willem Dafoe.
- No, not Willem Dafoe.

1000
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,800
- And not Will.I.Am.
- Not Will.I.Am.

1001
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,333
- Very Westwood, too.

1002
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,800
Only one boob, though.

1003
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,867
- Yeah, the other one got lost

1004
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:19,433
in the apocalypse.

1005
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:20,667
- As I'm walking down
the runway,

1006
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,500
I'm trying to give them some 90s
supermodel.

1007
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,633
Ass, ass, titties, hair, hair,
gas mask.

1008
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:29,100
- Cloudy with a chance of acid
rain.

1009
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,166
- I like the gas mask on the

1010
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,200
back of her head, it's very
two-faced.

1011
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,734
- Willam's a real gas.

1012
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,200
[laughter]

1013
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,500
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

1014
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,834
- Two queens enter,
one queen leave.

1015
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:41,867
- Yes, ma'am.

1016
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,400
- Is that a dream catcher

1017
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,500
covering her private parts?

1018
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,333
- Yes.
- [laughs]

1019
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,767
- I knew I looked fierce,

1020
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,667
I knew that my outfit could not
be touched.

1021
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,333
I felt like all the attention
was on me.

1022
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,333
I was just ready to serve it to
all the judges.

1023
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,600
- I think that's a honey badger

1024
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,633
on her shoulders.

1025
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,633
- Maybe we do need another hero.

1026
00:38:57,633 --> 00:38:59,066
- We might just need another

1027
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,800
hero, Santino.

1028
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,333
- Lashauwn Beyond.

1029
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,100
- Oh!
- Fabulous.

1030
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,433
- Lashauwn be hot.
- Yes, ma'am.

1031
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,400
She's got the whole world on

1032
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,900
her...head?

1033
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,433
- I thought a giant chicken laid
an egg up there.

1034
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,200
- I live for what I put down the
runway.

1035
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,600
I had the world on my head, and

1036
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,500
my "post-apoc-oloptic" couture
costume.

1037
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
It was sickening.

1038
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,533
- Now, I wonder if she can get

1039
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,800
cable TV with that on her head.

1040
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,867
- [laughs]

1041
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,467
- Chad Michaels.

1042
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,834
- Okay.
- Oh.

1043
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,734
- Ooh, how chic.

1044
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,767
She could walk a mile for

1045
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:33,800
a camel toe.

1046
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
- Real fish caught in the net.

1047
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,233
- I'm a perfectionist.

1048
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,133
It's something I pride
myself on.

1049
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:40,133
I'm feeling very confident.

1050
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,900
I love what I'm wearing, very

1051
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,667
post-apocalyptic diva, and I'm

1052
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,233
feeling really, really good.

1053
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,734
- Very "Lawrence of my labia."

1054
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,100
[laughter]

1055
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,800
- Up next, The Princess.

1056
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,166
- [gasps]
- Wow.

1057
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,633
- Wow, clown slippers.

1058
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:58,133
Looks like a life jacket.

1059
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,066
- Yes, queen overboard.

1060
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,233
- I'm giving the judges

1061
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,000
<i>Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> couture.</i>

1062
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,700
I feel like I'm really living

1063
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,900
for what I'm serving.

1064
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,066
I love it.

1065
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,533
- In case of emergency, your

1066
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,867
scarf can be used as a flotation
device.

1067
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,433
[laughter]

1068
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:13,767
Kenya Michaels.

1069
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,734
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1070
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:17,333
- She's a phoenix rising from
the ashes.

1071
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,767
- That's right.
- That's it.

1072
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:19,900
- Firebird.

1073
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,100
- Walk that walk!
- [squawks]

1074
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,934
- I feel amazing.

1075
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:29,467
I'm feeling fire, I'm<i> fuego!</i>

1076
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,633
That moment I remember for all

1077
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:32,834
my life.

1078
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:34,066
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.

1079
00:40:34,066 --> 00:40:36,767
Lil' Kim in the house.

1080
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,133
- Something's sprouting back
there.

1081
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:42,033
- Her garden is in full bloom.

1082
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,800
- Latrice Royale.

1083
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,133
- Yes, she is.
- Whoo!

1084
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,934
- Ooh, it's Latrice
from Whoville.

1085
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,367
- Yes, mama.

1086
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,300
- I'm Latrice, so of course I

1087
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,600
stomped it on out, and I'm

1088
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,567
givin' big girl sexy, showin'

1089
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,367
all my curves and swerves, and

1090
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,467
givin' a little face, givin' a

1091
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,567
little attitude,
and a lot of ass.

1092
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:03,266
- Yes, beyond thunder thighs.

1093
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,066
[laughter]

1094
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,533
Serve, honey.

1095
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,467
- Mm-hmm.

1096
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,467
- A queen for all seasons,

1097
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,333
Alisa summers.

1098
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,400
She's got goggles up there.

1099
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,934
- Apparently,
she's going skiing.

1100
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:15,967
- Ooh, I hate when drag queens

1101
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,233
have bigger boobs than me.

1102
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,300
- I'll say.

1103
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
The hills are alive.

1104
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,633
- I'm givin' them sexy, I'm

1105
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,567
givin' them dominatrix, and I'm

1106
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:25,633
on top of the world.

1107
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,400
There's no feeling like that,
ever.

1108
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,633
- And she's an all-terrain
vehicle.

1109
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,767
- Yes.

1110
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,400
- She a ATV summers, all-terrain
vajay-jay.

1111
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
- That's right.
- Oh!

1112
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,333
[laughter]

1113
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,934
- Paris, London, Tokyo, Milan.

1114
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,066
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

1115
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,200
- Wow.

1116
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,400
- This is an infected Betsey
Johnson, right?

1117
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,633
- Yes, it is.

1118
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:44,934
-<i> Love is a Battlefield.</i>

1119
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,467
- I'm serving the judges
savage beauty.

1120
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,066
I'm feeling ferocious.

1121
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:51,600
- I'm ready to attack.

1122
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,734
- Milan is burning.

1123
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,233
Now, let this be a lesson to all

1124
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,934
of us--don't smoke in bed.

1125
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,066
[laughter]

1126
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:03,200
- Next up, Jiggly Caliente.

1127
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,433
- Oh.

1128
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,300
- Look, she's got a leg up on
the other girls.

1129
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,367
- Yes, she does.

1130
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,700
Apparently, hoarding is the new
black.

1131
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,667
[laughter]

1132
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,133
- I'm here on the runway, and

1133
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,433
my adrenaline is on fire.

1134
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:15,734
Everything is pulsating through

1135
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,100
me, and I'm like, "Oh, here we

1136
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,667
"go, bitch, I'm gonna show you

1137
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,734
plus-size supermodel."

1138
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:21,700
- She's one hot potato.

1139
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,633
- And she seals in her natural
juices.

1140
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,700
[laughter]

1141
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,900
- Dida Ritz.

1142
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,166
- Work.
- Come on, girl.

1143
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,533
- Yes.
- Ooh.

1144
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:31,533
- Chocolate Barbie doll.

1145
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,433
- Legs for days.

1146
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,100
- I'm doin' my runway,
it's sickening.

1147
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,367
I am definitely channeling

1148
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:39,266
Naomi, I am channeling Giselle.

1149
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,900
I'm feeling it.

1150
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,200
- You know, everything tastes

1151
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,433
better when it sits on

1152
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:44,633
a Dida Ritz.

1153
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:45,834
- With thighs like that--

1154
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,800
- You better ass somebody.

1155
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,633
- Crack is whack.

1156
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,333
- Oh, Madame LaQueer.

1157
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,066
- Looks like my leftovers
last night.

1158
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:58,567
- Give her an inch, she'll take

1159
00:42:58,567 --> 00:42:59,600
a foot.

1160
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,233
- Take that, Betty Rubble.

1161
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,500
- I'm serving attitude and I

1162
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,166
feel so great, like I have never

1163
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,567
felt before in my life.

1164
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:08,734
- The entree of the evening,

1165
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:09,800
filet of sole.

1166
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,934
- Mmm, goes great
with some toe jam.

1167
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:14,166
- Mmm.
- Ew!

1168
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:17,066
- All right for Sharon Needles.

1169
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,233
- Ooh, look at those eyes.

1170
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,133
- Nosferatutu.

1171
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,567
- Oh, she's bleeding.

1172
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,066
- A dead woman walking.
- Oh, my goodness.

1173
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,800
- Zombies.

1174
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,333
- Somebody call a dentist.

1175
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,433
- I hope she's wearing
a dental dam.

1176
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:30,934
[laughter]

1177
00:43:30,934 --> 00:43:32,500
- Coming down the runway, the

1178
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,767
best part was slowly letting out

1179
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,834
a giant mouthful of fake blood

1180
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,633
all over my body, and that's

1181
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,967
when I really saw Ru's
eyebrow raise.

1182
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:42,367
It's a disco bloodbath.

1183
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:43,333
- Oh.

1184
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,633
- Ooh.
- It is.

1185
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:47,100
- Anyone told her
about fluoride toothpaste?

1186
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,734
- Gingivitis never looked
so good.

1187
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,433
Welcome, ladies.

1188
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,867
Judgment day has arrived.

1189
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:02,300
Now, based on your totally toxic

1190
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,900
photo shoot and your

1191
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,500
post-apocalyptic presentation,

1192
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,800
I've made some decisions.

1193
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Will the following queens please

1194
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,834
step forward.

1195
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:14,934
Willam.

1196
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,300
Milan.

1197
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Dida Ritz.

1198
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,066
Latrice Royale.

1199
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,100
Madame LaQueer.

1200
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,667
Phi Phi O'Hara.

1201
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,867
Chad Michaels.

1202
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,133
Seven of you look like you've

1203
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:44,734
been to hell and back.

1204
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:46,900
Con-drag-ulations, you're safe.

1205
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,700
- [exhales]

1206
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,834
- Just safe?

1207
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:53,934
My outfit was amazing, and not

1208
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:55,500
"just safe."

1209
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,500
- You may leave the stage.

1210
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,734
Oh, ladies?

1211
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,500
While you're back there, you may

1212
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,066
want to think of ways to make a

1213
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:13,367
more memorable impression
next week.

1214
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:15,734
- Yes, ma'am.

1215
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:16,934
- That's all.

1216
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,433
Ladies, you six represent the

1217
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:30,066
best and the worst of the week.

1218
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,600
It is time for the judges'
critiques.

1219
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:38,166
First up, Lashauwn Beyond.

1220
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:40,567
In the workroom you seemed
kind of nervous.

1221
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,133
Do you feel
more comfortable now?

1222
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:43,367
- No.

1223
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,667
It's a competition.

1224
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:46,066
I'm always worried, I'm worried

1225
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:47,233
now, I'm nervous.

1226
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,533
- America's next drag superstar

1227
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:51,300
needs nerve.

1228
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,233
She doesn't need to be nervous.

1229
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:55,700
- I am impressed that she can

1230
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,867
carry that giant thing
on her head.

1231
00:45:57,867 --> 00:45:58,834
I mean, I have this giant thing

1232
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,633
on my head, and it's bad enough.

1233
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,600
- [laughs]

1234
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,066
- As a symbol I think it's

1235
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,367
really great, of, like, a

1236
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,066
strong, black woman with the

1237
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,266
world on her head.

1238
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:09,433
I love all the disparate parts

1239
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,200
that you put together to create

1240
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,600
this overall silhouette.

1241
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,667
- Is there anything you'd like

1242
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,066
to say to the judges, Lashauwn?

1243
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,934
- I'm just in disbelief.

1244
00:46:16,934 --> 00:46:19,066
- What can't you believe?
- That I'm here.

1245
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:20,066
- Bitch, you're here.

1246
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:21,066
- Yeah, honey, you better snap

1247
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,200
out of it, you're here.

1248
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,066
Play to win.
- Okay.

1249
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:26,100
- Thank you.

1250
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,300
Up next we've got
Sharon Needles.

1251
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,734
- Hello, RuPaul.

1252
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:31,567
- How'd it feel up there
on the runway?

1253
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,433
- Oh, I felt drop-dead gorgeous.

1254
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,767
[laughter]

1255
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,967
- This is my kind of ghoul.

1256
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,233
I mean, I love the blood,

1257
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:41,800
and this is a whole different

1258
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,333
kind of take on drag queens.

1259
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,500
- You know, everyone sort of

1260
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,800
like survived the apocalypse,

1261
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,266
and made do with what was left.

1262
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:49,066
You took it one step further,
and you didn't survive

1263
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,066
the apocalypse.

1264
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:51,166
And then you came back to life

1265
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,166
to terrorize these bitches.

1266
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,166
[laughter]

1267
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,367
- Thank you, Sharon Needles.

1268
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,133
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.

1269
00:46:58,133 --> 00:46:59,667
- Hey, mama.

1270
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,500
- Okay, no one's gonna
accuse you

1271
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,800
of not havin' a great pair
of legs.

1272
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,233
- [laughs]
- First of all.

1273
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,333
But there's a little too much,

1274
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,433
it's sort of like,
"Oh, my god, ah."

1275
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,066
I'm getting my eyeballs
assaulted.

1276
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:13,400
Just a little bit less could
have been more.

1277
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,633
- Jiggly is a ball of energy,

1278
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:16,333
and funny, and I love that.

1279
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,367
- Thank you.

1280
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,867
- But, girl, right now
you're a mess.

1281
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:20,834
Things are fallin' off.
Fix your tutu.

1282
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,767
I be seein' your privates
and stuff.

1283
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:25,166
- No, girl, that privates
are put away.

1284
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,333
- Jiggly, is there anything
you'd like to say to the judges?

1285
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,834
- There's more, so much more.

1286
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,300
- More than what you've got on?

1287
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,100
- Well, but I'm talkin' about
all my clothes, all my drag,

1288
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,600
when I wear it out here--

1289
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,533
- We've heard that story before.

1290
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,400
You have got to bring your

1291
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,900
A game every single time.

1292
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,967
There's $100,000 at stake.

1293
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,834
- The time to bring it is every

1294
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,967
single time you come out
to this runway.

1295
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,133
Every single time.

1296
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,567
- I will, mama.

1297
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,734
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.

1298
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:56,200
-<i> Hola.</i>

1299
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
- So why a firebird?

1300
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,700
- I really--she's a firebird

1301
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,233
because if you're thinkin', uh,

1302
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:02,533
end of the world, you're think

1303
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:04,800
on fire, and I love that.

1304
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,967
- You pounded this runway.

1305
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,233
You came out, you were on fire.

1306
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,600
I wish you had your wings with

1307
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,100
you right now, because I'd like

1308
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,200
to see the work you put
into them.

1309
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,633
- You know that old phrase,

1310
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:15,734
"Don't get your panties
in a bunch"?

1311
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:17,066
- Yes.

1312
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:19,066
- Your panties look a little bit
like they're in a bunch,

1313
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,100
like a little diaper.

1314
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,834
- My problem is, it doesn't

1315
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:23,467
look really post-apocalyptic,

1316
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,567
but I still think you're

1317
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,467
beautiful, and you kill
a runway.

1318
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:27,467
- Thank you.

1319
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:28,800
- Thank you, Kenya.

1320
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,233
Next up, Alisa Summers.

1321
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,567
Tell me about your outfit.

1322
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:35,967
- I wanted to give kind of
a post-apocalyptic S&amp;M goddess.

1323
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:37,500
- And tell me the significance

1324
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,967
of the tool jutting out
of the areola.

1325
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:42,567
- I like to shoot fire
out of my titties.

1326
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:43,700
- Oh, okay.

1327
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,600
- The boobices, where'd those
come from?

1328
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,667
- What it is, it's like--it's

1329
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,967
built like a swimsuit, and it's

1330
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,300
just got the titties built right
onto it.

1331
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,367
- I was getting scared.

1332
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,400
I thought you were gonna say you

1333
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,734
pulled everything up
from down there.

1334
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:55,066
- From down here, all the way
up, yes.

1335
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,667
- You've got some big ones,
girl.

1336
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,567
And I'm feeling right now like

1337
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:00,500
my makeup is looking natural.

1338
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:02,867
- When you came out, I didn't

1339
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,200
really see anything

1340
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,900
post-apocalyptic
about your wardrobe.

1341
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,767
It's not couture, either.

1342
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:10,166
Even had you come out looking

1343
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,133
like a big garbage heap, or

1344
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:13,433
something, then there would have

1345
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,233
still been more effort made,

1346
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:17,166
to me, than what you have on.

1347
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,500
- Who the frig says what

1348
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,500
couture is, anyway?

1349
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,533
I don't get it.

1350
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:22,300
For him to say that's not
couture.

1351
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
Well, it's couture to me, girl.

1352
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,300
- [laughs]

1353
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,800
- And I love how much makeup you
have on.

1354
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,934
- Thank you.
- We kind of match.

1355
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:31,233
- All right.
Next up, the princess.

1356
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:32,500
- Nice outfit.

1357
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,233
Who shot the lifeboat?

1358
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:35,533
- It feels like it has a

1359
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,567
nautical theme, a little bit,
to me.

1360
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:40,266
- I'm kind of like Dennis Hopper
in<i> Waterworld.</i>

1361
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:41,567
- I love that you approached it

1362
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,200
from a nautical standpoint, the

1363
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,734
world being consumed by water,

1364
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:46,467
as opposed to fire and
brimstone,

1365
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,433
which is what everyone else did.

1366
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:48,500
- Thank you.

1367
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,467
- You put together
a well-constructed look,

1368
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:52,700
but there's no dirt, and you're

1369
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,667
going through an apocalypse.

1370
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:54,800
Like, it's completely--like,

1371
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
your whites are whiter
than I've ever...

1372
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,600
[laughter]

1373
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,633
Done my laundry in my life.

1374
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:00,734
- All right.

1375
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:03,367
Well, girls, I think
we've heard enough.

1376
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,467
- While you enjoy an Absolut

1377
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:06,934
cocktail in the interior

1378
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:09,000
illusions lounge, the judges

1379
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,500
and I will deliberate.

1380
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,533
You may leave the stage.

1381
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,600
All right, just between us

1382
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,667
girls, let's start with

1383
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,600
Lashauwn Beyond.

1384
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,367
- I thought the outfit
was fierce.

1385
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,200
I love the headdress, but she's

1386
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
kind of uncomfortable,
she kind of

1387
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,100
looks like she's at her first
prom, and--

1388
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,367
- Yeah, what was that about?

1389
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:28,600
- Eh, maybe she needs a couple

1390
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,367
more years to cook, you know?

1391
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,800
- I thought Lashauwn, more than

1392
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,700
any of the other queens, really

1393
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,433
met this challenge head on.

1394
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,467
- There's definitely some skills
that are worth exploring,

1395
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,734
but she definitely needs to

1396
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:40,066
overcome her shyness.

1397
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:41,967
- Yeah, it's cute for a taste,

1398
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:43,433
but not for a swallow.

1399
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,100
- Sharon Needles.

1400
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
Now, I really dug her outfit.

1401
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,166
It really told the story.

1402
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,400
- It's obvious she's polished,

1403
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,967
and she knows what she's doing,

1404
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:54,100
but I want to see her in girl
drag, too.

1405
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,166
- I love Sharon Needles.

1406
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,266
It's hard for me to find

1407
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,667
something bad about that.

1408
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,333
- Jiggly Caliente.

1409
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,266
Really funny, funny kid, but

1410
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,367
that costume, I don't even know
where to start.

1411
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:06,400
- She looked like she threw

1412
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,767
everything but the kitchen sink

1413
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,333
in there, but I think I saw

1414
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,333
the kitchen sink in there.

1415
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,533
- [laughs]

1416
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:13,266
- It was the complete opposite
of the apocalypse.

1417
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:14,400
- Right.

1418
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,834
- But I'm so in love with her
as a person.

1419
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:18,200
- Me, too.
- Kenya Michaels.

1420
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,233
Cute kid.

1421
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:20,400
When she walked down the runway,

1422
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,767
she dazzled us with

1423
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,934
those wings, but then she just
lost them.

1424
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:25,133
- Yeah.

1425
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:27,100
- She lost the most exciting
part of her outfit.

1426
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,066
- I did have an issue with

1427
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:29,300
the bedazzled diaper.

1428
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,600
Not apocalyptic at all.

1429
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,567
- No.

1430
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,066
- But that bitch
is fierce.

1431
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,200
- Alisa Summers.

1432
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,233
- She's so stunningly

1433
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:37,500
beautiful, I think she's used to

1434
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,867
kind of resting on those

1435
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:40,867
laurels, do you know
what I mean?

1436
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,233
I think it threw her
a little bit.

1437
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:43,633
You know, you need more
than beauty.

1438
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,533
- I got to say, Alisa 's outfit

1439
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,300
was very tacky.

1440
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,066
- She built her whole costume

1441
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,133
around that breastplate, instead

1442
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:52,367
of using it as a detail within

1443
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,500
some, like, grander, couture
sort of concept.

1444
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,066
- Right.
- Right.

1445
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:58,166
- Her outfit reminded me
of the worst movie in the world.

1446
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,633
- What?
-<i> Showgirls.</i>

1447
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:01,567
- Stop it right now!

1448
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,266
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mistress of the dark.

1449
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:04,667
- I mean, my favorite movie.

1450
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,567
- All right. The Princess.

1451
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:07,667
- I loved the blue and

1452
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,133
the orange together.

1453
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,066
That was my high school colors.

1454
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:12,133
- Go bears!

1455
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,400
- I liked and appreciated her

1456
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,367
overall look, but it wasn't

1457
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,200
really post-apocalyptic.

1458
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,900
I wasn't picking up
her references.

1459
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,133
- You know, I immediately got

1460
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:22,300
that<i> Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reference.</i>

1461
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,700
I love the Pete Burns,

1462
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,967
androgynous sort of vibe.

1463
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:27,266
I think she's great.

1464
00:52:27,266 --> 00:52:28,300
- All right.

1465
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,734
Silence!

1466
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:36,533
Bring back my girls.

1467
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,834
Welcome back, ladies.

1468
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,967
Now, which one of you bitches

1469
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:44,233
will inherit the earth?

1470
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:48,633
Lashauwn Beyond.

1471
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:51,467
Your post-apocalyptic outfit

1472
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:54,066
towered above the other queens,

1473
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:59,300
but your personality fell flat.

1474
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,734
You're safe.

1475
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:01,967
- Thank you.

1476
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:04,066

Jiggly Caliente.

1478

Your totally toxic photo shoot

1479
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,333
was winning, but your

1480
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,200
post-apocalyptic couture was

1481
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,633
an unnatural disaster.

1482

I'm sorry, my dear, but you are

1483
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,667
up for elimination.

1484
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,967
- When Ru tells me I'm in the

1485
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,433
bottom two, I want to die.

1486
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:32,567
I know the outfit looks jank,
but damn.

1487
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,066
- Sharon Needles.

1488
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:38,200
You killed this bloody

1490
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:43,934

1496
00:53:54,066 --> 00:53:55,233

1497
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,200

1499
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,533
That's sequinqueen.com.

1500

I'll have my dress made

1504

00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,367
- With a plunging neckline.

1506
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:14,500
- Hey, wait a minute.

1507
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,934
- All right, Sharon, you may

1508
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:18,800

1509
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,900
The Princess.

You're safe.

- Thank you.

1516
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,166
- Kenya Michaels.

1517
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,533
You pummeled the runway, but

1518
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,333
your firebird didn't fly with

1519
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:50,200

1520
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,133
Alisa Summers, your

post-apocalyptic showgirl left

1522
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:59,300
little to the imagination, but

1523
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,533
you were not "breast in show."

1524
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,967
Kenya...

1525
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,467
you are safe.

00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:11,867
Thank you.

1528
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,266
- Alisa, I'm sorry, my dear,

1529
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:21,834
but you are up for elimination.

1530
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:23,400
- Ru says I'm in the bottom two.

1531
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,667
It was just like, "really?"

1532
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,066
I--I can't believe it.

1533
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:27,967
I can't believe it.

1534
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:30,433
- Two queens stand before me.

1535
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:32,467
Ladies, this is your last chance

1536
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,500
to impress me and save yourself

1537
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,934
from elimination.

1538
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,567

00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,934
a queen for all seasons.

1598
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,900
Just not this one.

1599
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,633
Now sashay away.

1600
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:04,700
- [whispering indistinctly]

1601
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,734
- I definitely didn't think I'd

1602
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:06,900
be the first person to go.

1603
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,066
I definitely thought there were

1604
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:09,600
other people more eligible to go

1605
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
home before me, but I'm not

1606
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,066
disappointed in myself.

1607
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,233
I'm disappointed in what could

1608
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:15,300
have been.

1609
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,767
- Jiggly Caliente.

1610
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,133
May I call you Jiggly?

1611
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,066
- Yes, mama.

1612
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:27,266
- Shante, you stay.

1613
00:58:27,266 --> 00:58:28,934
- Thank you.

1614
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:31,433
- You may join the other girls.

1615
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:34,967
The toxic 12, con-drag-ulations.

1616
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:37,767
You live to die another day.

1617
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,834
Now, remember, if you can't love

1618
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:41,900
yourself, how in the hell you

1619
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,934
gonna love somebody else?

1620
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,600
Can I get a "amen" in here?

1621
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,300
all: Amen.

1622
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,333
- [laughs]

1623
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,533
Now let the music play.

Honey, this hour is jam packed.

63

- Face.
- Face.

64
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,834
- Beauty face.

65
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,867
Because when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

66
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,533
too much is never enough.

00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,700
- $5.00.
Try something new.

68
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,066
- But before we race
to the finish line,

69
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,133
let's go back
and pay our respects

70
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,800
to the nine amazing queens

71
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,066
that didn't make it
to the winner's circle.

72
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,567
- Hey, everybody,
look at me.

73
00:02:58,567 --> 00:02:59,600
Here I am.

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,834
- We are in my home.

75
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,633
I'm gonna show a few
of my things to you.

76
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,800
- Hey, RuPaul
and casting directors.

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
- I'm the one
you're looking for!

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,900
- Now, when Shangela
sent in her casting tape,

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,967
she'd been doing drag
for only three months.

80
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,066
- Now, you have to forgive me

81
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,934
because I had to drag myself
out of bed

82
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,166
to pull this video together.

83
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,433
[sniffles] Bitch think
he got the swine flu.

84
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,500
[sniffles]

85
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,467
- But what she lacked
in experience,

86
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,734
she made up for in enthusiasm,

87
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:28,066
showmanship,
and attitude.

88
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,367
- Some bitches,
when they in drag,

89
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,367
they are catty,
hateful hos.

90
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,400
But nobody likes a hateful ho.

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,333
Mm-mmm.

92
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,300
No, you need to be sweet
to people.

93
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,433
Girl, I got diesel breath.

94
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,667
[laughter]
- It's every single...

95
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,567
- Our next queen,
Nicole Paige Brooks,

96
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,934
was tasteful
and sophisticated.

97
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,667
In short, Atlanta eleganza.

98
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,367
- Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

99
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,166
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!

100
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,433
We just started,

101
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,266

my number one rule,

which is what?

103
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,633
If I can hear you over me,
you need to what?

104
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,633
- Shut the fuck up!

105
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,867
- You may remember me

106

season one,

107
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,767

108
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:11,967
and you got to see
my audition video on the show.

109
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,800

- RuPaul.

114

this time.

117
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,400
- We knew we loved
the marvelous Mystique

118
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,767
from the moment she shared

119
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,533
her most important
beauty secret--

120
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,266
two piece and a biscuit.

121
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,500
- Well, I already ate
that one piece,

122
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,867
and here's the other,
you know.

123
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,367
That two piece and a biscuit
can give you hips and curves

124
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,066
and everything else.

125
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,834
Drag for me
is a creative outlet,

126
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,400
and it's an expression on life,

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,533
and it's the art
of the illusion.

128
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,834
You know I'm a size 0,

129
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,734

and even a little bit of ass.

166

- Hi!
I'm Sahara Davenport!

167
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:30,166
Drag means, to me, freedom
of expression definitely.

168
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,066
What I can say
is drag has taken me places

169
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:36,834
where my career as a dancer
was unable to.

170
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:41,066
If I had to describe Sahara,
I would say

171
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,967
she has the grace
of Debbie Allen.

172
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,200

173
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,233

00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,166
at rupaulsdragrace.com.

179
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,500
- For me, Jessica
is a gift to myself,

180
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,066
because it gave me opportunity

181
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:11,500
to do things that as David
I was afraid to do.

182
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,266
- In drag,
comedy and timing

183
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,633
can be as important
as a tight tuck.

184
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:21,066
Pandora Boxx's
hilarious audition tape

185
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,500
proved she understood
the importance of all three.

186
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,166
- Tell us, Pandora Boxx,

187
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,066
what is the secret
to your success?

188
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,767
- Well, Michael, you see--

189
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,900
Oh, hold on.

190
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,700
I hope you don't mind
if I do something.

191
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,800
- Uh...okay.

192
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,300
- I'm 37 years old...ooh.

193
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,433
I just--that's the first time
I think I've said it out loud.

194
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,433
It's only been a week.

195
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,500
I don't know if you know,

196
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,800
but I did audition last year.

197
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,233
I didn't make it, clearly,

198
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,367
and I'm not bitter.

199
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,433
It's a kind of like
a little, um...

200
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,467
like a Swiss Miss kind of--

201
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,934
well, it's best
I just show you.

202
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:52,900
[claps]

203
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,266
Here I am.

204
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,333
<i>♪ Yodelay, yodelay ♪</i>

205
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,900
<i>♪ Yodelay-ee-hoo ♪</i>

206
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,266
- Tatianna's audition tape
was second to none

207
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:06,066
when it came to femininity
and sheer beauty.

208
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,500
- And if I don't get chosen
this time,

209
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,767
I'm gonna try again
next season

210
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,333
and the season after that

211
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,066
and the season after that.

212
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,934
And you're eventually
going to get tired

213
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,200
of seeing my face,

214
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
so it's in your best interests

215
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,467
just to get it over with now
and put me on the show, 'kay?

216
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,500
- All these girls
have sashayed away,

217
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,300
but even though
they left the race,

218
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,266
they're still
spreading the love,

219
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:33,734
and you can catch their acts
all over the country.

220
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,233
Find out where.

221
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:38,700
Just go to rupaulsdragrace.com

222
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,800
- Can I get a amen.

223
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,066
-<i> ♪ A-a-a-a-men ♪</i>

224
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,333
Oh!

225
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,900
- This year's queens
tore up the main stage

226
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,200
like never before.

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,300
And to help me
count down the top ten

228
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,200
most unforgettable
fits and fashions,

229
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,600
I've invited
three unforgettable queens

230
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,834
from last season--

231
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,467
the divine Ongina,

232
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,900
the fabulous Shannel,

233
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,166
and last season's winner,
the queen herself,

234
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,200
the incredible
BeBe Zahara Benet.

235
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Cameroon!

236
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,567
[laughter]

237
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,667
Hi, ladies.
- Hi, Ru.

238
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,567
- Welcome back
to the<i> Drag Race.</i>

239
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,633
- Thanks for having us.

240
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,066
- Shannel, you moved
to another city.

241
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,433
- Seattle.

242
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,834
- Now, did<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
change your life?

243
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:24,934
- The world.

244
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,066
All three of us--

245
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,533
we've just been in every city,

246
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,100
and it's been--
it's been amazing.

247
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,934
- Yeah, I've been reading
about you all,

248
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:33,633
and, BeBe, you moved
to a new city, too, didn't you?

249
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,633
- New York.

250
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,066
- People recognize you
on the street?

251
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,900
- Yeah, and that's
overwhelming too.

252
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,500
- So you've been watching
the show.

253
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,934
- Crazy 12 girls
you have there.

254
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,400
- I put together
the top ten list

255
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,500
of the most unforgettable
fits and fashions

256
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,633
on the runway.

257
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,066
Coming in at number ten

258
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,300
are the death-defying drops

259
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,300
of Miss Two Piece and a Biscuit
herself, Mystique.

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,934
Whoa!

261
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,266
Wow.

262
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,500
It always felt like she was
gonna break something.

263
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,767
- She dropped it
like it was hot.

264
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:05,867
- She sure did.

265
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,133
[laughter and applause]

266
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,934
Now, do any of you
do splits at all?

267
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,000
- Mm-mm.
- No?

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,433
I would think you could,
Shannel.

269
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,700
- I'll juggle, but no splits.

270
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,533
- Yeah, only in the comfort
of my own bedroom.

271
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,633
- [laughing]

272
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:20,633
- Honey, she had one foot
on the dresser.

273
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,633
- I think big girls
are always fabulous, though.

274
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,700
- Being a big girl,
you knew

275
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,533
that she had to pull out
all the stops.

276
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,000
- She's pretty too.
- She is pretty.

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
- Very pretty.

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,367
She's not afraid
of the cosmetics.

279
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,400
- No.

280
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,500
- She will get in there,

281
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,867
and she'll paint
for the Rose Bowl, honey.

282
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,266
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes.

283
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,433
She baked it
like Betty Crocker.

284
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,600
She did a thing
called cooking her makeup.

285
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,867
Do you guys cook?

286
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,300
- I mean, the queens
have to cook.

287
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,233
- Well, it's when you put
your foundation on your face

288
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,300
and you let it sit and warm to
your own body's temperature...

289
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,433
- I never knew that.
- So that it's--yeah.

290
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:51,433
- I cook.

291
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,867
- I'm cooking right now,
right?

292
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,533
I'm actually wearing
a Crock-Pot right now.

293
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,633
- Oh, okay.
- [laughs]

294
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,100
- Bet you can't guess
where it is.

295
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,667
- [laughs]

296
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,633
- I'll give you a hint.
It's near my lovin' oven.

297
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,266
[all laugh]

298
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,600
- I really like
her personality.

299
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,100
- Yeah.
- Yes.

300
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
- Now, after the burlesque show,

301
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,500
we asked our girls
to walk the runway

302
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,633
in their best high-class drag.

303
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:20,066
Coming in at number nine
is Miss Tatianna,

304
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,633
who brought it home
in Galliano realness.

305
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,200
Now, what did you think
of her dress?

306
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,400
- It was prom-y,
a little too short.

307
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,266
- I would've liked it
to have swept the ground.

308
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,934
- And a little train.
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:34,166
- Maybe not the earrings
with the necklace.

310
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,700
- But, you know,
give or take a necklace

311
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,967
or an earring or two,
that was one of her best looks.

312
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,967
Now, everybody knows my girls
are the crème de la crème,

313
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,900
but coming in at number eight

314
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,533
is Miss Jujubee in her getup

315
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,166
from the
Starrbootylicious episode.

316
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,500
Now, Jujubee was wearing her

317
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,834
"Imelda Marcos goes to the prom

318
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:57,066
in the Ashford &amp; Simpson
collection from Sears" dress,

319
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,467
but it was gorgeous.

320
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,333
You know, normally
that could not work,

321
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,967
but something about her humor
pulls that off.

322
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,367
- She seemed very bubbly
and kind of peppy.

323
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,233
I think she paints
really, really well.

324
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,100
- Reminds me
of a little Ongina.

325
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,367
[laughter]

326
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,066
- I like her
because she's Asian.

327
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,400
So go, Asians!

328
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,233
- Without the hair.

329
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,400
- Well, yeah.

330
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,266
No, she's--
I really like that dress.

331
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,467
- Yeah.

332
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,767
- I mean, you know,
if I wore that dress,

333
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,200
it would probably drown me,
but for her, it works.

334
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,667
- It works for her.
- And I think it's gorgeous.

335
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,500
- And, you know,
there's a certain consciousness

336
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,767
that Jujubee has that is, um...

337
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,867
it's kind of got a wink
to everything that she does,

338
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,200
and it made it work.

339
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
- She was a real transformation,
too, from boy to girl.

340
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,233
- I was surprised.
- Big difference there.

341
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,333
- Yes.
- Big difference.

342
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,633
- Yeah.

343
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,266
I think with a lot
of the kids this season

344
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,400
that the difference is huge.

345
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
- Yeah.

346
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,767
- I like her boy name too.
It's Airline.

347
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,300
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

348
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,767
- Yeah.
- No, I think that her--

349
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,200
She could actually use her
boy name as a drag name, yeah.

350
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,834
- Sure.
- But Jujubee is great.

351
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,066
- Jujubee is fantastic.

352
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,066
Do you know the meaning
of "jujubee," what that means?

353
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,200
- No.

354
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,166
- I think it's a--
- It's a candy.

355
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,500
- Yes, well, the--
it is, I think, in Thailand,

356
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,633
the truckers who are
traveling cross-country

357
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,834
chew this candy to stay awake
at night.

358
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,266
- Because it gets stuck
in your teeth

359
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,834
and then you can't even separate
your gums,

360
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,633
and you spend more time
picking it out of your teeth

361
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,667
than you do swallowing it.

362
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,300
- She has pizzazz,

363
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,266
and she's always going, "Pah."

364
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,433
- In the Country Queens episode,

365
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,867
Jessica Wild's country couture

366
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,467
left the others in the dust,

367
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,967
and it has her coming in
at number seven.

368
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:30,533
Was she bootylicious or what?

369
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,066
- Hip-alicious, bootylicious--

370
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,633
she's padded for life.

371
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:35,800
- Now, of course,
she was padded.

372
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,166
Now, you don't pad,
do you, Ongina?

373
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,200
- No.

374
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,133
- And, of course, Shannel

375
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,433
doesn't need to pad,

376
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,467
because she's got it.

377
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,467
- Junky trunk, right?

378
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,266
- Now, um, our queen--

379
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,900
any tips for padding
for the kids out there?

380
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,967
- Um, I don't pad.

381
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,100
- Oh, you don't pad?

382
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,266
[laughter]

383
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:51,633
- I don't pad.
- That's a lie.

384
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,066
- Do you think
that Jessica's pad job

385
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,900
was acceptable by our queen?

386
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,100
- Well, you know what?

387
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,200
- I just--of course it's due.
- Yeah, yeah.

388
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
- I think it was--yeah.

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,633
It was realistic,

390
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,900
but then again,
you have to figure out

391
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,834
how tall you are
and how short you are

392
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,100
to make it that realistic.

393
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,166
- Right.
- You know?

394
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,867
- So I shouldn't get that made.

395
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,233
- Well, you can get it made,
but you have to--

396
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,934
- In that size.
- You can make it to your body.

397
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:14,967
- Oh, okay.
- Right.

398
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,367
- Some girls, you know,
only pad here

399
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,266
when they really should pad,
like, say, from the knee up,

400
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,400
or they may have--

401
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,700
They may--a lot of times,
girls, I think

402
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,100
will put their pads too low,
too,

403
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,166
because they want to hear
a lot of hip hugger things.

404
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,767
And then they've got, you know,
an ass that sits on the ground,

405
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,100
which, I mean,
I'm the last one to talk,

406
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,133
but, you know, see...

407
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,500
- Well, I think that Jessica

408
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,967
did her padding very well
this time.

409
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,934
Now, we asked our judges
to work the runway,

410
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:37,600
and divas like Kathy Griffin,

411
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,834
Dita Von Teese,

412
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,400
and Miss Debbie Reynolds

413
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,700
showed us queens a thing or two
about being fabulous.

414
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,166
Coming in at number six

415
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:50,767
are the stunning runway stylings
of our<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> judges.</i>

416
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,166
What'd you think
of our star power

417
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,367
on the runway this year?

418
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,200
- Kathy Griffin coming out
with the damn bar--

419
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,767
but I love
Debbie Reynolds too.

420
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,133
- Debbie Reynolds.
- Oh, my God, she's adorable.

421
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,233
- She introduced herself
as Princess Leia's mother.

422
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,867
And Henry Rollins--he gets
sexier with age, actually.

423
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,800
- If you need a housekeeper.

424
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,700
- Talking about sexy,
Dita Von Teese...

425
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,834
- Oh, yes.
- Amazing...

426
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,066
- Yeah, true living pinup.

427
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,133
- In the Rocker Chick challenge,

428
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,467
my girls had
to transform themselves

429
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:23,100
into rock star divas.

430
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,633
And together, they come in

431
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,600
at number five
on the countdown.

432
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,166
- I was really impressed
with Raven and Tatianna.

433
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,800
-<i> ♪ This groove</i>
<i>is for my girls ♪</i>

434
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,467
<i>♪ Little lady boys and girls ♪</i>

435
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,567
- Especially Raven--
I think that the hair was just--

436
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,600
the color contrast
was really hot.

437
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,300
- Well, she was paying homage
to Terri Nunn,

438
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,066
who was from the group Berlin,

439
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,900
and that was Terri Nunn's
trademark hairdo.

440
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Now, I know that you did
the rap on my song.

441
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,567
- Yes.
- And you have a song out now.

442
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,066
- Yeah.
- What's it called?

443
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,900
-<i> I'm the Shit.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, God.

444
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,066
[laughter]

445
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,066
Now there were a lot of looks
this season

446
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,233
that drew inspiration

447
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:05,066
from history's
greatest superstars.

448
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,367
But in the Once Upon a Queen
episode,

449
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,567
a star was born,

450
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,133
and that's why Raven
is number four

451
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,066
on the countdown.

452
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,700
- I love Raven, and I also am
a huge Streisand fan.

453
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,834
So I loved it
'cause it was<i> Goldmember</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

454
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,266
meets<i> The Main Event.</i>

455
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,367
- It was a very surprising look
for her.

456
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,500
- She took out her piercing.

457
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,834
- She took out her piercings.

458
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,934
- Which made the look
a little bit more high glamour,

459
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,867
because if she would have
kept them on,

460
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,133
then it would have not worked
for me.

461
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,934
- Although I kind of
secretly would love

462
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,700
to see Barbra Streisand
with those piercings.

463
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,233
- Yeah.
- Can you imagine?

464
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,533
- Yeah.
Maybe she is pierced...

465
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,767
Down there.

466
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,834
[laughter]

467
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:48,667
- For the busy drag queen
on the go,

468
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,600
versatility is a must.

469
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,633
So I love it
when a single outfit

470
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:56,400
suddenly turns into two
or three or more.

471
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,133
Coming in at number three,

472
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:03,700
behold the many country looks
of Tyra Sanchez,

473
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,967
the other Tyra.

474
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,934
- If you're going to work
with the first outfit

475
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,300
and then you have to run out
to lunch

476
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,200
on the second outfit
and then dinner on the third--

477
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,600
- Right, and then
the escort agency calls.

478
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,166
[laughter]

479
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,934
- I like reveals,
because I think it keeps you

480
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,133
very interested
and it's, like,

481
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,200
the "oohs" and the "ahhs"
and really gives you

482
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,066
that whole showgirl
aspect of it.

483
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,066
- Yes.

484
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,200
In season one,

485
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,333
there were a few little spats

486
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,700
between the contestants.

487
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,934
Right, girls?
- Maybe.

488
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,100
- Just a few.

489
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,600
Well, this season,
we had a shootout

490
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,700
at the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Corral.</i>

491
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Coming in at number two,

492
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,800
it's the terrible Ts,

493
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,734
Tyra versus Tatianna.

494
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,333
What are the judges not seeing?

495
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,900
- Tyra is a complete bitch.

496
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,266
- She talks so much shit
about so many people

497
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,734
but won't say it
to their face.

498
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:55,500
- The reality is in this field
there is so much cattiness.

499
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,900
After having been dressed
for so many hours

500
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,367
and under the lights
and all of that,

501
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,567
you know, tensions are high.

502
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:01,834
I mean, God knows in our season,
I mean,

503
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,867
I had lots of frustrations
myself.

504
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:04,900
Things happen.

505
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,200
Sometimes you just have
to vocalize it.

506
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,734
- All right, kids, we are down
to number one in our countdown.

507
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:13,867
- Ru, can I say something?

508
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,600
I think it's time I take over.

509
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,300
- Uh, BeBe, you may be
the next drag superstar,

510
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,333
but it's still my show.

511
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,200
- Well, I think the moment
has come for us

512
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,333
to reveal the most unforgettable
fits and fashion

513
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,133
from the runway all worn by you.

514
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,166
- Me?
- You!

515
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,200
- Me?
- Obviously you.

516
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,367
- Oh, my God.

517
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,367
I'm back.

518
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,567
- My favorite
is the very Lacroix one

519
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,133
with the pleats
and the three shades of cream,

520
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,400
beige, and a little lavender.

521
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,533
- I think that looks so pretty.

522
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,934
- That was our Wedding show.

523
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,233
I played the mother
of the bride.

524
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,300
- It's gorgeous.
- Then the red and black.

525
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,867
- Right, now that was very
Miss Ross.

526
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,066
- But it was so beautiful.

527
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:09,934
That was so striking

528
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,333
and the silhouette
of the body...

529
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,800
- And I love
all the ostrich feathers

530
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,433
on the lilac dress,
the strapless.

531
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,834
- What made some of those
outfits so fantastic

532
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,867
was the fact that you
changed hair color.

533
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,133
- Well, Mathu always wants
to top himself.

534
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,867
I think with
the punk rock outfit,

535
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,700
I think that's probably
the biggest hair

536
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,633
I've ever worn in my career.

537
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,066
Ladies, thank you so much
for stopping by.

538
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm so happy
for all of your successes,

539
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,967
and I can't wait till we're all
on the<i> RuPaul Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Tour</i>

540
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,200
all over the world.

541
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,300
- Thank you.
- Yes.

542
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,834
- Thank you
for making it happen.

543
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,967
- You guys make sure
you tune in next week

544
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:55,600
to see who will be crowned
the next drag queen superstar.

545
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,734
Now, I hope you're hungry...

546
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:58,066
- [belches]

547
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:01,100
- Because I've been digging up
some tasty tidbits,

548
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,834
unseen morsels,

549
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,900
and delicious
behind-the-scene nuggets.

550
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,867
[growls]

551
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,200
all: Cherry pie! Cherry pie!

552
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,533
Cherry pie!

553
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,633
- Now naturally, there was
some fierce competition

554
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:13,633
between the queens.

555
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,867
- It's a competition.

556
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,266
- But what impressed me the most

557
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,166
was the mutual love and support,

558
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,567
because when it comes to drag,

559
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,867
support is essential.

560
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,400
- I'm trying to get this bitch
just to stay on.

561
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,900
I hope I can make
some new drag sisters

562
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,700
to really give me some tips,
help a bitch out.

563
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,567
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,033
- We all genuinely want
each other to look good.

565
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,700
- Do you have time, baby,
to help me just put this on?

566
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,200
- People that are
helping each other,

567
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,834
they're helping each other
because they want them to stay.

568
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,600
- And so you just take
your white,

569
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
highlight all this area,
and make that pop.

570
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,533
Granted, this is a competition.

571
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,900
It's also a learning experience.

572
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,533
- You, like, want me
to wrap it around you?

573
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,033
- Put--poom, poom, poom, yeah.

574
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,367
This look too bad?

575
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,700
If you are going to win,

576
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,834
you are going to win
no matter what.

577
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,433
That's why if I need
to give you my panties,

578
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,066
I give you my panties,

579
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,200
because if I'm going to win,

580
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm going to win
with or without panties.

581
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,800
- Our girls weren't afraid
to talk about anything,

582
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,967
including a drag queen's
best kept secret.

583
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,333
I'm talking about padding.

584
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,633
Are you a padded queen?
- I do pad, yes.

585
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,333
- I wear hip pads, yeah,
but I don't wear a butt pad,

586
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,600
'cause I have
a little bit of a--

587
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
- Okay.

588
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,100
- Did you see my ass?

589
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,233
Did you see my hips?

590
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,467
Boys don't have that.

591
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:24,734
I molded that.

592
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,233
- I think you've got
quite a shape there.

593
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,300
- Well, yesterday,
I wore hip pads.

594
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,066
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,

595
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,066
but if you're trying to do drag,

596
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,667
use your pads to look
at least like a girl.

597
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,800
- Now, you don't have padding.
You're not a padded queen.

598
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,166
- I like being thin.

599
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,300
I like--I modeled myself after,
like, a supermodel.

600
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,400
We're not like that in L.A.
We don't pad.

601
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,867
That's an East Coast, Midwest,
Southern thing

602
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,233
where they're pageant girls.

603
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,266
- It's private,
you know what I mean?

604
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,734
I'm putting on my body.

605
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:55,066
- This season,
the drag queens proved

606
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:58,367
that they were talented
celebrity impersonators.

607
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,867
But behind the scenes,

608
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,500
these queens
stepped up their game

609
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,467
and started doing each other.

610
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,600
- Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.

611
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,900
- "Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia."

612
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,667
- [laughs]

613
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,967
- [mocking laugh]

614
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:16,900
- I hot glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.

615
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,066
- "Tyra, can you pass over
that hot glue gun, please?

616
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,900
"I'm fixing to glue
some rhinestones

617
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,533
onto my gown that
I'm trying to fix and make."

618
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,834
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,

619
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:29,066
but technically,
I'm doing Beyoncé.

620
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:31,533
- "I love Beyoncé."

621
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,467
- As drag queens,
we make our own families,

622
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,266
but when the girls talked
about their real families,

623
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:40,066
the emotions ranged
from admiration

624
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,233
to something more complicated.

625
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,333
- "Dear son,
this is your mommy speaking.

626
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,633
"You're a very talented child,

627
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,266
and you could be
whatever you want."

628
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,800
She wrote me a note once before

629
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,533
when I was competing
for something

630
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:53,600
when I was, like, 20,
and I've kept it.

631
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,066
"So remember, if you don't do
what you're trying to,

632
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,600
I'll be behind you
with my belt."

633
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,900
- So your mom
said she's gon' beat you

634
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,066
if you don't make it?

635
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,266
- Yeah, basically.
- Damn.

636
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,500
- I'm really fortunate,
because a lot of people

637
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,100
don't have that family base,
you know?

638
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,667
Especially in our community.

639
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,533
And I'm just lucky to have a mom
that's so supportive

640
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,333
and I love very much.

641
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,900
- My father's one
of the toughest Scotsmen.

642
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,500
Like, he's a man's man,
you know?

643
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,233
And he was so okay
with me being gay.

644
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,533
He was like, "I love you.

645
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,633
It doesn't really matter
as long as you're happy."

646
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,066
And I was like, "Bizzle."

647
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,467
- To each his own.
- Absolutely.

648
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,767
- Like, when people
find out you're gay

649
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,333
and they're like,
"You know God loves you,"

650
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,400
yeah, I know he does.

651
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,734
Imagine what the world
would look like

652
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,900
if there weren't gay people.

653
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,767
Eww.

654
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,066
- I loved hearing
all the girls' backgrounds.

655
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:42,800
But Jujubee's sense of history
was positively Shakespearean.

656
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,467
- Did you guys know
the word "drag" is an acronym

657
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,767
that Shakespeare created?

658
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,333
- "Dress resembling a girl."

659
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,433
- It was actually a side note
for his plays,

660
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,567
because back in the day,

661
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,533
the players of the stage
were all men.

662
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,333
- They were ladyboys.

663
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,066
- One thing there was
no shortage of was girl talk.

664
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,233
- Whoo!

665
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,266
- Think it was gay pride
last year or something.

666
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,066
I got a taxi, and we go home.

667
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:07,867
I was, like, in drag in bed
like, "Come on, baby.

668
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,233
Let's do it."

669
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,467
[chuckles]

670
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:13,433
And he's like, "No!
You're Sahara!"

671
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,934
- Well, and people ask him,
you know,

672
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:17,734
if we have sex when I'm in drag
and all that stuff, so...

673
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,433
- There's ever been a night
where you're just messy drunk?

674
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,066
And you're just like,
"I don't want to take this off.

675
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,266
Let's just do it."

676
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,333
- No.

677
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,367
- Now, you know I love
a good catchphrase.

678
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:30,300
The time has come...

679
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,700
for you to lip-synch...

680
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,266
for your life.

681
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:40,500
Gentlemen, start your engines.

682
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,266
And may the best woman win.

683
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,633
And don't fuck It up.

684
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,867
But this season,
I had some serious competition.

685
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,367
- Work.
- Work.

686
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,200
- You better work, bitch.

687
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,533
- I'm not a bitch.
I'm America's sweetheart.

688
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,433
- Thank you.
Thank you.

689
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,066
Thank you.
Thank you.

690
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,200
Thank you.
Thank you.

691
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,500
- Thank you.

692
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,800
- Are you going through it?

693
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,567
Are you going through
some psychological changes

694
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,500
in your life?

695
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,266
- I'm not.
- I'm not either.

696
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,300
- Now, I know you're
a two piece and a biscuit.

697
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,834
- As long as that two piece
and a biscuit is there,

698
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:11,934
I am perfectly happy.

699
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:12,900
- [laughs]

700
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,333
- I got my two piece
and a biscuit

701
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,333
waiting on me anywhere I go.

702
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,433
- During my worldwide tour,

703
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,900
I stopped in Texas,
and I did meet mystique,

704
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,667
and she wanted to be tipped
with a two piece and a biscuit.

705
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,633
- Two piece and a biscuit.

706
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:28,166
Mystique gone but not forgotten.

707
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,967
[laughter and applause]

708
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:33,133
Now, it's been
an incredible season...

709
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,100
What do the bags say?
They say "Santino"?

710
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,133
[laughter]

711
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,867
Dripping with charisma,

712
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,266
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.

713
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:41,266
- Marker.

714
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,433
- Welcome to another--

715
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,633
Oh, shit.

716
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,567
- And I'm not just talking
about the queens.

717
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,066
I'm talking about the judges.

718
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,734
Sassy Santino

719
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:53,300
and our resident fashionista,
Merle Ginsberg,

720
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,633
not to mention our star-studded
panel of guest judges.

721
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,767
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.

722
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,934
- [gasps]

723
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,700
- Kathy, did you know Jessica
was padded?

724
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,967
- I am too actually.
- Okay.

725
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,066
- Yeah, I've been padded
for the last ten years.

726
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,834
[laughter]

727
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,266
- The judges brought a lot
of life experience to the show,

728
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:16,934
and the contestants
were all ears.

729
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,600
- You must not listen
to the interviewer.

730
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,066
If he says,
"Where are you from?"

731
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,633
you say, "Well, actually,
I'm from so-and-so,

732
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,900
but in my book,"
and then you name the book.

733
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,266
You always have to bring it in
yourself,

734
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:26,734
'cause they're never
gonna bring it in.

735
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,300
- I started working
in a strip club,

736
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,967
like, with the regular girls.

737
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,066
You could walk into the club,

738
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:33,233
and you could find
that there was one girl

739
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,800
everyone was trying to be like,

740
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,133
and they're all doing
the same thing,

741
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,667
so it doesn't make
financial sense.

742
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,467
- So your lip sync
was very, very good too,

743
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,700
which I noticed right away,

744
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,767
because in films,
that's what we always did.

745
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,066
It's not easy
to lip-synch correctly,

746
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,400
and you did a super job.

747
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,734
- In the real world,
if you get arrested

748
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,133
and don't speak English,

749
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,967
the court
appoints a interpreter.

750
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,200
But here on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

751
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,333
language barriers
are just part of the fun.

752
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,166
Did you tuck your candy?

753
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,367
Did you hide your candy?

754
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,700
- My candy?

755
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,233
- Yes.
Um,<i> como...</i>

756
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,066
-<i> Huevos.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Huevos el pollo?</i>

757
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,333
- Oh, my--this?

758
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,066
- Something with Angela
at the end.

759
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:12,500
- Everyone has a problem
with my name.

760
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,200
- I was gonna say Kangela.
I'll change mine to Kangela.

761
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,233
- 'Cause a lot of kids
are calling you Shan-gella.

762
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,867
- Or Shanga-linga.

763
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,967
She called her
Shanga-linga.

764
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,533
- I do have an ointment
in my dressing room for that.

765
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,066
Yeah, you know,
a lot of the judges

766
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:27,066
mentioned Tyra's deep voice.

767
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,867
- When you transform into Tyra,

768
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:31,934
why doesn't your voice change?

769
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,200
- In fact, Santino
didn't just mention it.

770
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,467
He worked it.

771
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,700
- [in deep voice]
I think that Tyra should stay,

772
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,800
but sometimes when I see her
and she's talking to me,

773
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,233
I just think, "Who is this dude
talking to me?"

774
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,433
- [laughs]

775
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,333
- I'll give you $4,000
to stop that right now.

776
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,066
- Right, right, me too.

777
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,800
Now, most queens aren't shy,

778
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,767
but this is a family show.

779
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:56,166
So you have to use
a little discretion.

780
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,734
And nothing says discretion
like a double entendre.

781
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,700
- Anybody that's eating
my cherry pie

782
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,433
raves about it.

783
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,834
- How's the crust?

784
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:07,900
- Crispy

785
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,800
and a little tender
in the middle.

786
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,900
- And the fruit?

787
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,066
- Always ripe.

788
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,066
- Is it juicy, Pandora?

789
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,700
- It's overflowing with juices.

790
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,066
- Would you say your cherry pie
was succulent?

791
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,166
- I would say it's succulent
and a bit moist.

792
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,266
- Oh.

793
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:26,700
- [laughing]

794
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,934
You getting hungry, Kim?

795
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,200
- I'm getting hungry.

796
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,600
- Now, for some queens,

797
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,967
the ultimate praise is when
people think you're a real girl.

798
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,900
- It's really a woman,
isn't it?

799
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,934
- It is really a woman.

800
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,066
- I knew it.
I knew it.

801
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,300
- It's called being fishy.

802
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,533
- When you walked out,

803
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,533
I really did have
that same moment that Dita had.

804
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,166
Is that a girl?
I think that's a girl.

805
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,133
There's an imposter in the show.
It's a girl.

806
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:48,567
Check her crotch.

807
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,133
- Well, maybe we have
a real scandal here.

808
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,133
Maybe she's actually
a real woman.

809
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,700
- What?
- Ever thought about that?

810
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,233
- I will walk off this set.

811
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,367
- I will kick her ass.

812
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,333
- I was give her a pap smear
in five seconds,

813
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,066
and I will get
to the bottom of it.

814
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:03,266
- This season, we not only
dished celebrities.

815
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,533
We ate 'em for lunch.

816
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:05,600
- I mean, I love everything.

817
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,967
I'm gonna be the Paula tonight,
I think.

818
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,166
I'm the Paula
of the RuPaul show.

819
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,600
- I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls

820
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,700
who would like to take you out
if you ever--

821
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,667
if you're ever available.

822
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,066
[laughter]

823
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,166
- I really like Lady Gaga
a lot.

824
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,233
She's almost like
a drag queen herself.

825
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,166
- Almost?
You're very kind.

826
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,667
You actually did more work than
Britney does in her concert.

827
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,166
I mean, you actually sang
in your concert,

828
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,967
which is something
Britney does not do.

829
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:34,100
- I like that wig.
It looked good.

830
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,300
You know, I really did see--

831
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,600
Leslie Stahl
has a good wig as well.

832
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
Leslie, I'm so sorry.

833
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,467
- At the end of the day,

834
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,800
I hope I'm less of a judge
and more of a teacher.

835
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,567
And the best way to teach,
of course, is by example.

836
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:50,700
Earlier today, I had my face
lifted for a fifth time.

837
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,834
Why?

838
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,433
Because I'm dedicated to this,
children.

839
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:57,834
You are a burning sensation,

840
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,567
and I don't want an ointment
to clear it up.

841
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,033
You have to use what you've got
to get what you want.

842
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,700
You know, my friends call me
the MacGyver of drag.

843
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,500
I will take a wire hanger and...

844
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,533
- A Maxi Pad.

845
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,233
- And jimmy-rig
a lighting system

846
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,433
in a hotel room.

847
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:16,066
- What happens sometimes
is that my nuts pop,

848
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,867
and it reminds me
that I'm a dude.

849
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:18,934
- [laughs]

850
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:20,300
- So I try to go right back

851
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,066
to being feminine,
so that's what happens.

852
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,100
- Yeah, I mean, I know--

853
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,967
everybody knows
about popping a cherry,

854
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:28,867
but nobody talks
about popping a nut.

855
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,000
- No.

856
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,567
- It is part of doing drag.

857
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,567
So in case you missed
any of the fierce action...

858
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,567
- You pushed me!

859
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,100
You pushed me!

860
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,567
- Here's a fast-forward
flashback

861
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,266
of this season's competition.

862
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,166
- Cheeseburger, Taco Bell,

863
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,166
and a Diet Coke on the side,
girl.

864
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,333
- On the first day,

865
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,066
the Gone with the Window
photo shoot

866
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:52,467
tested the queens' ability
to get real,

867
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,000
to get glamour,

868
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,266
and get blown.

869
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:57,133
- I've never been blown
like that in my life.

870
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,567

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,266
Legendary
looks like leg and dairy.

1044
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,800
- Oh-ho-ho!

1045
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,900
- Jujubee wasn't afraid

1046
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,533
to share some of the pain
from her past.

1047
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,934
Where do you get your sense
of humor from?

1048
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:50,834
- My father passing away
when I was 15.

1049
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:52,066
- 15?

1050
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,333
- Yeah, and from then on,
it was just, like,

1051
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,100
you know, I can't be stuck
in this little ball.

1052
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,266
- Right.

1053
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,767
- And I can't, you know,
cry about it anymore.

1054
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,800
He was like my king.

1055
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,867
He did everything for me,

1056
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,200
he taught me everything I knew,

1057
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,734
he knew that I was gay
before I knew I was gay.

1058
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,367
He dragged me to school
every morning,

1059
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,934
and the last thing
he would always say

1060
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,300
before I left the car was,

1061
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,567
"And don't let those kids
tell you anything different."

1062
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,200
He's like, "I know
what they say about you.

1063
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,767
You can do
whatever you want to do."

1064
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,800
And--and that's what I'm doing.

1065
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,333
- But Jujubee's
positive attitude

1066
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,767
is positively infectious.

1067
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,133
- I have the full package.

1068
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:28,166
I have personality,
I have sense of style,

1069
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,367
and I have great big,
white teeth.

1070
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,867
- I thought she was dynamite.

1071
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:33,934
She had a fantastic personality.

1072
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,200
- I'm already happy
about just being here.

1073
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,967
But if I win,
everybody gets a puppy.

1074
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,767
- Our next finalist
is the other Tyra--

1075
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:47,066
the beautiful, the gorgeous,
the alluring Tyra Sanchez.

1076
00:39:47,066 --> 00:39:49,633
- During my transformation,
when I start feeling like Tyra,

1077
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,500
it's backstage,
putting on the makeup.

1078
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,667
But it all comes into place
when I hear them say...

1079
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,633
- Tyra Sanchez.

1080
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,767
- Hear that crowd screaming.

1081
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,900
And then once that music starts,

1082
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,633
my heart stops for probably,
like, a split second.

1083
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,834
And it starts beating again,

1084
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,767
but it's not my heart
at that point.

1085
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,266
It's Tyra's heart
that's beating.

1086
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:08,633
- Tyra.

1087
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,600
Ah.
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.

1088
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
- It's very Rita Hayworth.
<i>Gilda.</i>

1089
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,266
- Yes,<i> Gilda.</i>

1090
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:17,133
- Tyra had to overcome a lot
to achieve what she had.

1091
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,834
- I grew up in probably, like,
every project in Orlando.

1092
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,367
Like, at the end
of every school year

1093
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:22,934
someone got shot or murdered.

1094
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:24,000
- And in real life,

1095
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,033
this hot drag mama
is a young dad.

1096
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,967
- I do have a son.
- Jeremiah.

1097
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,700
Oh, that's the tattoo you have.
- Yeah.

1098
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,033
My son makes me smile
every time I see him.

1099
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,333
My son is my motivation
to keep going,

1100
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,734
to make his life better.

1101
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,266
- You know a family that
drags together stays together.

1102
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:43,600
I would love to be
America's next drag superstar

1103
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,100
to, like, inspire more people

1104
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,433
to, like, let them know
that they can do it too.

1105
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:52,166
- Raven is a Southern California
girl down to her roots.

1106
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,800
- You guys need look no longer,

1107
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,600
because the best queens
are in Southern California.

1108
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,934
- Raven!

1109
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:00,300
Oh, darling!

1110
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,467
- I love doing drag

1111
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:02,900
because I love
the transformation.

1112
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,800
I love being able to transform
from a guy into a girl

1113
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,633
and then at the end of the night
being able to take it off.

1114
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,700
- Raven!

1115
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,200
- I definitely do not want
to be a girl.

1116
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,133
I love myself, who I am.

1117
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,200
It is an art form.

1118
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,100
- Now, Raven
landed in the bottom two

1119
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,200
early in the competition...

1120
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,900
Raven...

1121
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,166
I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.

1122
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:27,400
But proved she had the stuff
to make it to the final three.

1123
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,867
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

1124
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:32,400
- Well, first of all, I'm<i> </i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>

1125
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,166
If I were to win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

1126
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,300
it will help to show people
that drag's cool,

1127
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
'cause it's fucking cool.

1128
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,667
Drag's cool.

1129
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,700
- Well, there you have it,

1130
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,400
the fabulous final three.

1131
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,533
And if you've been groovin'
to any of my songs this season,

1132
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,734
you can find them all

Or read my book<i> Workin' It!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

1135
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:58,667
Join me next week
for the grand finale

1136
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,400

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,333
to find out who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.

1138
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,834
But most importantly,
remember,

1139
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,700
if you can't love yourself,

1140
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,734
how in the hell are you gonna
buy my album and my book?

1141
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:15,867
All right,
now let the music play.

1142
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,133
<i>♪ Don't be jealous</i>

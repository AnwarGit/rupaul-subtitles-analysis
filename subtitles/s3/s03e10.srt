00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,100
- Hi, guys.

182
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,533
There are a couple of things

183
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,300
I think you need to know as you
go through the competition.

184
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,233
You need to let your personality
show through.

185
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,433
We really wanna see that you
know who you are.

186
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,600
<i>Show us what it means to be</i>

187
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,934
part of this family and part
of Absolut.

188
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,300
- Now, ladies, this week

189
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,200
each of you will record

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
the brand-new RuPaul song
<i>Super Star.</i>

191
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,266
all: Ooh!

192
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,867
- But each of you will be

193
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,667
interpreting it in a totally
different

194
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,100
<i>and timeless musical style.</i>

195
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>Your options are hip-hop...</i>

196
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,266
<i>country...</i>
<i>disco...</i>

197
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,300
<i>reggae...</i>

198
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>punk, or pop.</i>

199
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,066
Now, Manila, since you won
the mini-challenge,

200
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,834
<i>you get to choose first.</i>

201
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:47,066
And then one at a time,
you decide who chooses next.

202
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,867
- I'm gonna go with...

203
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,667
bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo...

204
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,333
disco!

205
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,734
- Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah!

206
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:59,200
- Now, Manila, who gets
to choose next?

207
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,433
- We'll go with Raja.

208
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,300
- I want punk.

209
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,066
-<i> Who gets to go next?</i>

210
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,967
- Yara.

211
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,433
- Yara gets to go next.

212
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,333
<i>Come on over, Yara.</i>

213
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,600
-<i> Manila picks Yara, not Carmen.</i>

214
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,300
What happened to Team Heather?

215
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,667
- I'm gonna take pop.

216
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,500
- All right, Manila,
who goes next?

217
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,567
- Alexis.

218
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,567
- Alexis.
- Thank you, Manila.

219
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,667
- I get what you're trying to
do, Manila,

220
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,567
but girl, just pick
the Heathers.

221
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,100
Who cares about those boogers?
Girl, stop being fair.

222
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,767
- I'm gonna take the hip-hop.

223
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,834
- All right, mami.

224
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,200
- Next is Carmen.
- Next is Carmen.

225
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
- Finally.

226
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,266
- Carmen, are you feeling
coun-try?

227
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:42,467
Or are you feeling reg...gae?

228
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:43,967
- I really like reggae.

229
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,467
So I'm gonna go with reggae.

230
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:46,867
- Okay!

231
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:47,900
And of course, that means,

232
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,133
Shangela, you are our
country queen.

233
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,900
- I'm straight out
of Paris, Texas,

234
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,700
and I'm going to hold onto
the country.

235
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,767
- All right, ladies, before
your recording session,

236
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,633
<i>you'll have time to rehearse</i>
<i>and put together</i>

237
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,934
an appropriate performance
outfit.

238
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,433
<i>Until then, gentlemen...</i>

239
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,934
start your engines...

240
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:15,667
and may the best woman win!

241
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,800
- Carmen Carrera.

242
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,734
Join us here on
<i>Alexis Mateo Show.</i>

243
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,133
<i>You have any questions</i>
<i>for our comedy queen?</i>

244
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,200
- No, I thought you--I thought
you was gonna ask--

245
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,467
I thought this was your show.

246
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,066
- I'm giving you the free option

247
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,500
to say something to her before
we continue

248
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,967
just criticizing you.

249
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,834
[laughter]

250
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,867
Manila just took me by surprise.

251
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,867
- I wasn't expecting her
to pick me first.

252
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,066
I know her.
She would have said okay.

253
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,066
<i>Now, who do I think's gonna try</i>
<i>to turn this competition?</i>

254
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,734
I don't want them to have
the music they want.

255
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,834
- I don't really read into
those things.

256
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,066
I think that some people might
want to, you know, stir up

257
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,500
some drama because of that, but
I think that's why she did it.

258
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,667
- Oh, I don't think nobody's
trying to stir up drama.

259
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,166
<i>But you can be stupid all day</i>
<i>long,</i>

260
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,900
pretend to be aloof,
but I know better, honey.

261
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,367
You go play that one with
somebody else.

262
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,934
- I think Alexis and Shangela
wanna start drama.

263
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,233
Fuck those hos.
Who cares?

264
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,800
Maybe she did and maybe
she didn't.

265
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I don't know.
I'm gonna ask that bitch.

266
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,633
Gonna ask her now.

267
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,934
<i>They're trying to say that</i>
<i>you're trying to sabotage me</i>

268
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:22,567
because I only had two options
instead of four,

269
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:25,500
and I should have been called up
there after this bitch.

270
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
- You know what, honey,
it's not shade.

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,467
I'm not strategizing
besides myself.

272
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,734
- Oh, so you're being selfish.

273
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,333
- Going down the line was like
the easiest and fairest

274
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,066
way to do it, 'cause I don't
wanna start drama

275
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,133
being like picking you guys
first and then having

276
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,300
all the other girls being like,

277
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,633
"Oh, Manila's just picking
the Heathers."

278
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:45,266
- I actually wanted the reggae
one, actually, so...

279
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,600
- Well, then it worked out,

280
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,500
so what are you fucking
complaining about, bitch?

281
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,066
- I'm not complaining about
anything.

282
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,333
<i>Don't get me twisted, honey.</i>

283
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,867
- You know what? No.

284
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,033
<i>Carmen's trying to start up</i>
<i>some motherfucking drama!</i>

285
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,567

She doesn't sing in English.

316

[laughing] She doesn't sing in
any language.

317
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,633
- Bah!

318
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,600
- Hello, hello, hello,
my superstars.

319
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,233
all: Hello.

320
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,367
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.

321
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,100
- Lady reggae.
- Yes.

322
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,066
- Does this challenge
frighten you at all?

323
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,734
- No, this excites me.

324
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,400
- Because you were
in the bottom two...

325
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
- Maybe I might have a little
bit more to prove,

326
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,400
but I like a challenge.

327
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,066
I'm not gonna try to fake it,
you know?

328
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm just gonna sing like I do

329
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,767
and gonna go with something that
I can pull off.

330
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,433
- Irie, man.
One love.

331
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:32,734
- Okay.

332
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,834
- Well, hello, Raja.

333
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,900
- Hi, gorgeous lady
of wrestling.

334
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,367
- [laughs] Yes!

335
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,700
So why'd you choose punk?

336
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
- As much as I wanted to be a

337
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,734
punk rocker as a teenager,

338
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,800
I was way too glamorous up here.

339
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,066
- Ha ha ha ha!

340
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,633
- Like I could not stick
a safety pin in my nose.

341
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,200
I might bleed, it might hurt.

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,967
- You've been criticized for
over-thinking your challenges.

343
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,633
You're very cerebral.

344
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,767
What is your strategy to sort of
break out of that?

345
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,834
- Well, you know, this is
a perfect one for me

346
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,767
because I can finally go balls
to the wall.

347
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,900
- Something that's always worked
for me is to remember

348
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,066
that what other people think
of you...

349
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:06,834
- Right.
- Is none of your business.

350
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,066
- Yeah.

351
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,567
- That--that's their--
that's them.

352
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,967
All right, Raja.
- Thanks, Ru.

353
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,367

00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,066
that it's important that we just

881
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,066
are open-minded with regard
to country.

882
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,567
I know you guys are definitely
open-minded to that,

883
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,867
and so I appreciate all
your comments back.

884
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,266
- When we're sitting here,
we hear that song,

885
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,567
that's what dictated it.

886
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:49,567
It's not our preconceived notion
of country.

887
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,367
It's that [imitating banjo]
<i>♪ ra-dah-diddle-did-dah ♪</i>

888
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,166
You know?
That's what you heard.

889
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:59,333
- All right, next up, our
pop princess Yara Sofia.

890
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,867
I love the fact that you put
some Spanish in there.

891
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,800
- Yes.
-<i> That was fantastic.</i>

892
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
- Thank you.

893
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,600
- I don't know if I would have
picked that outfit

894
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,800
for that version of the song,

895
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,633
<i>but you do look spectacular.</i>

896
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,500
- I appreciate that sex sells.

897
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,767
<i>I might have maybe covered up</i>
<i>a little skin.</i>

898
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,066
- Had you stood at the back
of the stage back there

899
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,567
for a little longer with
the mic stand,

900
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,667
you could have sold the ballad
a little bit more.

901
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,367
- Yes, you could have worked
the mic stand more,

902
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,600
but you connected
with the audience.

903
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,900
I love the glitter.

904
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,133
<i>It's very Britney MTV</i>
<i>Video Music Awards,</i>

905
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,433
<i>I'm a Slave.</i>

906
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,066
Britney wants her old body back
too, by the way.

907
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,066
- I bet she does.

908
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,066
[laughter]

909
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:38,667
Up next, our punk queen Raja.

910
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,400
We've been asking you here for
you to tap into that power

911
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,333
that you have when you walk
the runway,

912
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,233
and it looked to me like
you did it.

913
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,567
- I loved it.

914
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>I loved the performance;</i>
<i>the lip sync was great.</i>

915
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,166
- You really owned the stage on
this one.

916
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,500
<i>I mean, I was there.</i>

917
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,834
<i>I felt like I could have gotten</i>
<i>in the mosh pit.</i>

918
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,066
- When I was 14, I had the same
hairdo, but it was blue.

919
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,767
<i>Everything was on tonight,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>

920
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:04,200
Your performance, your look,
your attitude, the emo...

921
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,500
Like, way on.

922
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,400
- Thank you so much.

923
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,767
<i>- Up next...</i>

924
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:12,133
lady reggae, Carmen Carrera.

925
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,433
Tell me about your outfit.

926
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,633
- Well, my outfit is kind of
like if Bob Marley

927
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,600
had a lovechild
with a Puerto Rican girl

928
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,233
and she grew up in jersey.

929
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,400
-<i> I love the outfit.</i>

930
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,266
There was some problems
in the lip sync.

931
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:25,800
It was a little off.

932
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,233
- So, now Jeffrey, she pulled
the guy up onstage,

933
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:31,667
but she left him there.

934
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,066
- Frankly, he diverted
my attention

935
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,333
a little too much from you.

936
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,433
This is about you.

937
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,667
You're going to be
the super star.

938
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,967
It made me feel like quality
impression...

939
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,967
and a little low on the
delivery.

940
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,467
- I sound horrible,
but that's okay--I'm a man.

941
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:46,700
- You didn't sound horrible.

942
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,934
You didn't--you just--it felt

943
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:51,700
that you weren't committed
to the vocal.

944
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,567
Ladies, $75,000 is at stake.

945
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,467
<i>And the decisions get harder</i>
<i>and harder to make.</i>

946
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:00,967
And I need your help.

947
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:05,200
Who should go home tonight
and why?

948
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,834
Raja.

949
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:10,867
- Oh, man.
I fucking hate this question.

950
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:14,200
You know what, I--
oh, God.

951
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,533
I would Shangela,

952
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,500
only because, you know what,

953
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,900
clearly you could go down
the line,

954
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,700
you can tell which genre
of music every one,

955
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,934
for the most part,

956
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,834
and then, you know, it just kind
of gets lost

957
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,500
as far as her look.

958
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,567
- Carmen, same question.

959
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,233
- I have to agree with Raja

960
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,333
because I feel that there's
always a look issue.

961
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,633
You need to look the part

962
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,400
if you're going to be
a drag super star.

963
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,433
- Where look is definitely
important,

964
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,734
you have to be able to perform,

965
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,300
and you need to be able
to connect,

966
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,200
and obviously she didn't do that
tonight,

967
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,900
and she has continuously not
done that

968
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,100
throughout this competition,

969
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,233
and that's truly why I feel
Carmen Carrera

970
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:50,967
should be the one who goes home
tonight.

971
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:52,200
- Alexis Mateo.

972
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,100
- I'm going to pick Carmen
Carrera as well,

973
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,300
and I think she's resting
and pretty.

974
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,600
- All right, girls,
I think we've heard enough.

975
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,333
Now while you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail

976
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,367
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

977
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,567
the judges and I will
deliberate.

978
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,900
You may leave the stage.

979
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,533
All right, just between us
girls...

980
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:16,667
<i>We'll start with Manila.</i>

981
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,400
Now, I have never enjoyed
a performer

982
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,834
to come out and immediately
attack the audience.

983
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:22,900
- I loved the fro,

984
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,066
and I love what she delivered,

985
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,600
but I think I'm with you.

986
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,867
I don't want her attacking
that audience.

987
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:29,900
- I think she looked good;

988
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,433
her costume and the whole
package.

989
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:34,066
And I love that she attacked
the audience.

990
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,166
Good for her.

991
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,767
-<i> Alexis Mateo.</i>

992
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,867
- The good was she really did
own her performance.

993
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,100
- It's hip-hop.

994
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,533
We don't know you as that kind
of an artist,

995
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,533
and then you come out here.

996
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:45,700
You got a hip-hop hat on,

997
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,633
you got a girl hip-hop jacket
on,

998
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:48,767
and then the rest is stripper.

999
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:49,967
That's not hip-hop.

1000
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,400
- I mean, what was she supposed
to wear,

1001
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,934
some--she's supposed to sport
a sag and a wife beater?

1002
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,066
- If I pick her up, we're going
to an interview

1003
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:59,133
and I see those--you
gotta cover those up!

1004
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,867
- Well, a big trend
in queens these days

1005
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,567
are those latex boobs.

1006
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,300
- Oh! I don't like the way
they look.

1007
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,066
Those aren't breasts.
These are breasts!

1008
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,667
- Oh! Girl!
- These are breasts!

1009
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,066
- You don't have to tell me
twice.

1010
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,400
Shangela, now, she made
a bold decision

1011
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,567
to do today's country look.

1012
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,600
- She didn't do it for me.

1013
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,734
And I understand, you know,

1014
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:18,734
the whole "I want it to be
current

1015
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:19,767
and I want it to be now
country,"

1016
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,133
like...fine.

1017
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,734
But someone's paying you to do
something, sweetie;

1018
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:24,967
you gotta deliver on that.

1019
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,500
- I almost don't even remember
it,

1020
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,700
it was so middle of the road.

1021
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,400
- If you have to explain it,
it's not being projected.

1022
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,700
It was a fail.

1023
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,433
-<i> Yara Sofia!</i>

1024
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,633
- That body is near-perfection.

1025
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:38,166
- But with that said,
that voice is still there.

1026
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,266
- [laughs]

1027
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,567
- And I don't ever want to hear

1028
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,300
her record again, just FYI.

1029
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,700
[RuPaul laughing]

1030
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,967
- I don't know, I thought she
had guts to get up here.

1031
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:48,467
She sparkled.
I liked her.

1032
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,066
-<i> Carmen Carrera.</i>

1033
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:52,200
- The best thing about it for me
was the outfit.

1034
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,300
- I saw...some style with
no substance.

1035
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,800
- I think she's too
self-conscious

1036
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,100
about looking anything other
than sexy.

1037
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,133
- Right.

1038
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,467
- And I do think she has the
goods,

1039
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,066
like she's not moving past this
point of posing.

1040
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:06,467
- That's her crutch.

1041
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:07,600
So she really doesn't have to

1042
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,333
bring anything else.

1043
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,700
-<i> Raja.</i>

1044
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,133
- A lot of performing
is owning it.

1045
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,333
Raja just owned it.

1046
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,266
- She walked out with those
Doc Martens

1047
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,533
<i>and that little plaid number,</i>

1048
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,800
<i>and I'm like, she got it!</i>

1049
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,533
- She can study a look,
and she can get it,

1050
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,800
and she works it on the runway,

1051
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,734

through that?

1055

- I think this was so in touch
with the core of who she is

1056

that we can't really judge if
she's broken through or not.

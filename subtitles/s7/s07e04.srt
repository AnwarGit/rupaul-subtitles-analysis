{\an8}Fame just rubs my nerves out.
That's not drag.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,245
{\an8}You'll be acting in Romy and Juliet,
and my favorite, MacBitch.

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,784
Head coach... head cheerleader is going
to be me, Laquisha Quian. Oh, fuck.

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,422
In seven seasons, I've never seen
a car crash like this before.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,060
Max, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,897
Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,133
Wake up, Pearl.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,436
Couldn't you sense that
it wasn't going right?

10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,739
Nobody knew their lines.
I'm not gonna take their blame.

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,642
I don't want to hear
any goddamn excuses anymore!

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,013
Kennedy Davenport.
Shantay, you stay.

13
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,251
Jasmine Masters. Sashay away.

14
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,961
{\an8}-[Kennedy] Oh, lord.
-Home sweet home.

16
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,536
{\an8}and it's not there anymore.

17
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,304
{\an8}[Katya] So how did you feel?

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,508
{\an8}You know, to do it against your friend...
it was hard.

19
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,746
It's bittersweet because
me and Jasmine are so close.

20
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,915
{\an8}But I just have another chance.

21
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,018
Pop the corns and feed the children.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,720
Pop the corns and feed the children.

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,092
{\an8}Jasmine was just
a bad seed in the bunch.

24
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,595
{\an8}Nobody wants to pop the corn
and feed the children. That's disgusting.

25
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,299
Let me pop this bunion and
have the kids feasting for days?

26
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,801
Are you kidding me?
Who thinks of this shit?

27
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,404
[Trixie] Pearl, did your life
flash before your eyes?

28
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,506
Yeah, you thought you were going home.

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,143
I don't know, it's crazy.
Usually I have a blast when I'm in drag.

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,014
But it was all about me walking
with my eyes half closed.

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,584
I thought I had bedroom eyes.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,220
Pearl's been sleepwalking
through this competition.

33
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,757
Pearl has to get her head in the game
if she wants to make the top three.

[all] Hi.

56
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:25,338
You know in showbiz,
one day you're in on the joke,

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,941
and the next day,
the joke is on you.

58
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:34,314
So for this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be creating music video parodies

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,117
of one of my favorite artists ever!

60
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,788
-Me.

[screams]

62
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:48,628
Working in three teams, you'll have to
write lyrics, record vocals,

63
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:54,667
{\an8}and then shoot your own
#PunnyOrDie music video.

64
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:59,005
{\an8}I feel really good about this challenge.
I can sing, and comedy is what I do.

65
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:05,545
Now, to mix things up, I'm gonna leave it
up to you to divide yourselves into teams.

66
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,180
All right, go for it, now.

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,915
[chatter]

68
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,585
Honey, I am a singer,
so I get boom, boom, boom.

69
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,155
-Are we a team?
-Three people cling to me for dear life.

70
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,825
I want you on my team.
I go right to Katya because she's funny.

71
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:23,162
I look right at Fame because she can sing.
And I love Pearl, so that was our group.

72
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,800
-Well, I guess that leaves us three.
-Here, let's do it. Let's just do it.

73
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,168
Yay.

74
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,072
{\an8}I've already been picked last
for teams twice, so who the fuck cares?

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,379
Now, for this challenge,
you really need to straddle the world

76
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,548
of music... and comedy.

77
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,783
[laughter]

78
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,953
Gentlemen, start your engines.

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,422
And may the best woman win.

80
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,225
[Violet] Let's get to work.

81
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,695
I think this challenge is complicated.
We have to come up with new lyrics

82
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,500
{\an8}to "Sissy That Walk" and then come up
with a music video. The pressure is on.

83
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:06,039
What if it's like, "Your face like chalk,"
and do really bad makeup or something?

84
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,408
[Violet] I mean, that's, like,
the obvious thing.

85
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,310
We can probably come up with better.

86
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,211
Hm.

87
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,015
{\an8}Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of, uh...

88
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,351
{\an8}...bitchy.

89
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,154
[Violet] We have to get
these lyrics really funny...

90
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,226
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.

91
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:32,498
"I don't want to be raunchy or dirty."
Are you fucking kidding me?

92
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,405
-Okay.
-We get "Dance With U."

93
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,509
I'm pretty confident that we can
make it into a funny parody.

94
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,012
I want to do
"I Want to Tan With You."

95
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,917
Let's think of a couple more options.
Well, maybe two more.

96
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,921
We could make it about raunchy,
dirty sex because that always is funny.

97
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,157
♪ Take my hand
I wanna touch your cock ♪

98
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,159
[Pearl] No, it's gonna be gross.

99
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,463
Give us a better concept
so we don't have to worry about that.

100
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,032
Well it shouldn't fall
on my shoulders just because...

101
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,134
-No, I get it, but, like--
-Thank you.

102
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,070
Pearl has really been falling short.

103
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,441
It's frustrating, because I'm on a team
with you. We have to pull each other up

104
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,176
or else your friends are going home.

105
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,313
[Miss Fame] We need to come up with
something. We're running out of time.

106
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,516
-Let's just do fucking tan with you.
-[Miss Fame] Okay.

107
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,987
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hello.

108
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,490
-Hey, kitty girl.
-[all] Hi.

109
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,626
-I am very excited about this challenge.
-[all] We are too.

110
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:39,799
-Do any of you do parodies in your act?
-Rihanna's song. I turned it into "Suh,

111
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,268
burb and, and, and".

112
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,937
A little suburban gal number.

113
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,606
Ah.

114
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,343
Now, Kennedy, you were
in the bottom two last week.

115
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,311
Has that lit a fire under your tuchus?

116
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,047
-Oh, it definitely has.
-I have to tell all of you.

117
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,951
As the competition shrinks,
it gets stronger.

118
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,421
I'm expecting you all to deliver.

119
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:07,293
I had a shitty last challenge,
and Ru is expecting big things.

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,829
I have to shake it off
and keep my head in the game.

121
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,399
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, RuPaul.

122
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,968
So are you fans of song parodies?

123
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,939
If they're clever. Sometimes they get
a bit raunchy and vulgar for me, but...

124
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,511
-Well, don't compromise your Christianity.
-No, Ma'am. [laughs]

125
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,713
-So, what song are you working on?
-"Sissy That Walk".

126
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,050
We want it to be a tie-in
to the top three from last season.

127
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,388
-What became of "Sissy That Walk"?
-"Get Ready to Clock."

128
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,856
Uh-huh.

129
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,060
Well, I cannot wait to see
what you have to offer,

130
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,498
-because I'm expecting a lot from you.
-Thank you, Ru.

131
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,502
-Hello.
-Hi, Ru.

132
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,440
I feel like Trixie is the leader
because I know you do a lot of comedy.

133
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,742
Turns out making fun of you
is a lot easier than I thought.

134
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,777
[RuPaul laughs]

135
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,379
She definitely thought of the concept.

136
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,382
-[RuPaul] What is the concept?
-[Pearl] "Tan With You."

137
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,019
-Four ladies who just love the sun.
-Overcooked, overgrown orangutans.

138
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,822
I love that. That sounds fun.

139
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,059
So now, with lyrics...
Are any of you lyricists?

140
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,661
We're comfortable to say,
"Not funny. We're not doing that."

141
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,364
I know, it's been
a little bit harsh over here.

142
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,901
Who is the most harsh?

143
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,571
All right.

144
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,008
Pearl and Fame are butting heads.
This is not a good sign.

-Yeah, once before, and it was a disaster.

Ladies, I've made some decisions.

477
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,665
[RuPaul] When I call your name,
please step forward.

478
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,499

481
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,644
This week, each of you emerged
as the star of your group.

482
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:07,979
Oh.

483
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:14,319
But one of you really made a mockery
of everything I hold sacred.

484
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:21,960
Kennedy Davenport. Condragulations, you
are the winner of this week's challenge.

485
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,027
Oh, my God.

488
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,338
Thank you so much.

489
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,040
Miss Fame and Ginger Minj,

490
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,810
you're both safe.

491
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,211
Thank you.

492
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,947
The five of you may leave the stage.

493
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,789
Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.

494
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,791
First up, Pearl.

495
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,627
About your character
in the "Tan With You" video,

496
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,430
you have to loosen it up, girl.
Come out of your shell.

497
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,968
We want more vitality and more energy
and more star power.

498
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,772
Are you a stoner, girl?

499
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,274
'Cause that's, like, the vibe I got.

500
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,612
There's plenty of girls here that take
their time "Coming out of their shell,"

501
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,082
but I feel picked on, almost.

502
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,652
-[RuPaul] All right, thanks, Pearl.
-Thank you.

503
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,021
Moving on. Trixie Mattel.

504
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,756
The idea of "Tan With You" is funny.

505
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,459
Were there big, butt-gusting,
knee-slapping, LOLs? No, but I liked it.

506
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,495
You are not standing out for me,

507
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:35,900
and I want to see some identity and some
flavor. I'm not getting that from you yet.

508
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,904
If you're gonna be the Comedy Queen,
you have to go all the way.

509
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,508
Don't let anyone else stand out.
You have to.

510
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,643
Next up, Max.

511
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,246
I do enjoy the look tonight.
I wish it was all green.

512
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,348
-It's a hint of green, really.
-Okay.

513
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,619
And I'm going to challenge you
to give us a look without gray hair.

514
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,020
All right.

515
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:00,725
I know there's not a lot of green, but I
just think it's so creative and so cool.

516
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,928
-Thank you.
-You were the weakest in your group.

517
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:08,132
Courtney Act is not easy to do.
She's not a big personality,

518
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,436
but I felt like you could have done more.

519
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,138
Next up, Violet Chachki.

520
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,710
Your tushy is so phenomenal.
It's just perfection.

521
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,613
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-It's so good.

522
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,514
Your Adore was quite good, too.

523
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,851
You could have done more besides
just the stomping and the open mouth,

524
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,754
-but again, more bigger. Now is your time.
-Right.

525
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,157
Thank you very much.
Next up, Kandy Ho.

526
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,225
<i>Hola.</i>

527
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,195
If you look around,
everyone has looks, concepts,

528
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,064
and I don't think
a pretty dress is enough.

529
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,569
You were on a team with three other
really big personalities,

530
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:49,240
and I wanted you to stand out even more.
You got lost in that challenge.

531
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,810
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.

532
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,314
You walked out in that outfit,
and I love a <i>schticky</i> queen,

533
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,883
and it's a great twist
on the green theme.

534
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,985
[Michelle] So let's talk about the video,

535
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:04,856
this kind of sing-talk thing that you do.

536
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,457
{\an8}♪ <i>Oh, the wig</i> ♪

537
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,027
You don't think you can sing,
is that where we're going?

538
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,830
What happened was, I think Bea Arthur
was inside me when we were recording,

539
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,465
and I was like, "There's the voice today."

540
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,869
We have something in common.
Bea Arthur was once inside me as well.

541
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,105
-Wow.
-[laughter]

542
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,341
All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

543
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:27,979
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

544
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,385
All right, just between you, me, and these
fierce drag jewels I'm wearing...

545
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,453
[laughter]

546
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,288
What do you think? Pearl.

547
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,591
She just kind of feels lazy.
And it's like, don't be lazy.

548
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,193
This is it.

549
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,796
I feel like it's nervousness.

550
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,465
-What would you tell her?
-Get your head out of your ass.

551
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,400
Work it out.

552
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,302
Trixie Mattel.

553
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:56,708
She says she is campy and dresses like it,
but I've not seen the personality yet.

554
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,511
I didn't really understand who Trixie was.
She was lost in the video.

555
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:05,216
I've seen many audition tapes, and hers
was one of the funniest I've ever seen,

556
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,519
but Trixie has yet to emerge as Trixie.

557
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,724
-[RuPaul] Max.
-You can tell how creative she is,

558
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,093
and you have to be intelligent
to be that creative.

559
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,129
I was a little underwhelmed
by this characterization.

560
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,733
She was worried more about being
the best Courtney Act she could be...

561
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,769
...instead of being
the drag version of Courtney Act.

562
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:30,541
Violet. Here's a queen who has studied.
She's really smart and 22 years old.

563
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:34,012
-Oh, I want to suck the life out of her.
-[laughter]

564
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,616
It's funny, because Violet
in the studio struggled a little bit

565
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,087
and then I saw the video and I was,
"Oh, my gosh, that's Adore."

566
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:47,125
I think she could have gone further
in the video, a little more over-the-top.

567
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,495
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
-She didn't stand out in the video,

568
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,198
{\an8}but she did a great job with the ad-libs.
That is what impressed me the most.

569
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,567
-Yes.
-But standing next to these other queens,

570
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,469
personally, it wasn't enough.

571
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,839
It seems like she's
really channeling glamour

572
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,941
and that's kind of it.

573
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,944
[RuPaul] All right, Mrs. Kasha Davis.

574
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,248
She did, kind of, blend in
a little bit too much in the video.

575
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,717
I don't know. I love her,

576
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:17,789
because she harkens back to
a different sort of age of drag to me,

577
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,024
-and as much...
-Why were you looking at me?

578
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,958
[Michelle screams]

579
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,628
-No, I specifically didn't.
-[laughter]

580
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,198
Silence. I've made my decision.

Ladies,

633
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,386
I've made my decision.

634
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,630
Pearl. Shantay, you stay.

635

All right,

638
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,150
you may join the other girls.

It's okay.

Trixie Mattel,

00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,997
you are an amazing queen.

Keep on dreaming

643
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,403

Now, Sashay away.

I had more cool looks, I had better jokes,
and I'm funnier than I was showing,

649
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,525
so that was a bummer, but I hope I get
to meet lots of fans who like what I do.

{\an8}Condragulations, ladies.

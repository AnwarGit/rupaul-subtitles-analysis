If anybody had to come back
and be my partner, I'm glad it's you.

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,117
That's a fucking lie. I'm not happy to see
any of these bitches walk back in,

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,354
because I have fought too hard
for my spot here

168
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:33,693
to have somebody go take a vacation
to come back and join the race.

169
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:40,132
So, it seems like everybody else
will be joined at the hip or at the head.

170
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,868
We got to do something that stands out.

171
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,843
Okay, okay, we can do this.
We can make it work.

172
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,184
What if we connect at the boob?
Like, just share one big boob.

173
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,619
Yeah. No, I like it.

174
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:05,624
Yes, we need to be funny,
but we actually have to look good too.

175
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,930
[Ginger] Sasha Belle don't sew.
I don't sew. So...

176
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,101
I don't know what the hell we're gonna do
to make this sewing challenge work.

177
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,972
We should do something gorgeous but gross,

178
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,542
just like my drag.
It's pretty but nasty at the same time.

179
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,579
-Yeah.
-We can be beauty queens...

180
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,347
Like in a beauty pageant?

181
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,516
-Like, little kids, though.
-Yes.

182
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,118
-Absolutely.
-But creepy.

183
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:38,824
{\an8}There's so much to do. I'm stressed out.
But if I'm gonna be doing all of this,

184
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,826
I'm really happy it's for Trixie.

185
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,863
We can give you acne,
and I'll have perfect skin.

186
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,397
Yeah, okay.

187
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,935
-Hello, hello.
-Hi.

188
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,038
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited</i>.

189
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,942
Violet and Max.

190
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,977
-Hello.
-Hello.

191
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,781
Max, you have a chance to come back,
so the stakes are very high.

192
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,084
-Yes, ma'am.
-What is your strategy to win?

193
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,887
You know, taking Max's style
and really amping it up,

194
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,057
-and turn it a little tchotchke, tacky.
-So you're in the driver's seat.

195
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,860
-Yes, ma'am.
-You're still in the competition,

196
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,495
so you're calling the shots.

197
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,331
-Where will you be conjoined?
-We love corsetry.

198
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,668
We'll be completely hourglass together.

199
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,205
{\an8}Girl, please,
we don't need to see how small

200
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:31,677
{\an8}you can make your waist
with this damn corset every challenge.

201
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,515
-Get back to work.
-I.J.S. I'm just saying.

202
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,185
Miss Fame.

203
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,386
-Hi, Ru.
-Kandy Ho.

204
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,889
-Hi.
-You're an unlikely pairing.

205
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:48,928
-Did you all connect before you left?
-We never got a chance to connect at all.

206
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:54,600
But I wish I had a bit of Kandy.
She's fearless, and I'm full of fear.

207
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,305
There's an energy she exudes on stage
I need to have in my life to be better.

208
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,409
I said, "I wish I'd have had the chance
to get to know more about you,

209
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:07,680
and here's our chance
to really know who one another is."

210
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:12,785
{\an8}Miss Fame, she talks so much.
Her answers are paragraphs.

211
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,188
She's got such a balance
and a fearlessness about her.

212
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:21,627
Her energy is what I need. There's been
moments in my life where conversation,

213
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:27,266
it's like it goes right through my head,
and I want to be able to show who I am.

214
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,836
Girl, just shut the fuck up. Just shut up.

215
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:37,009
Miss Fame, you've talked about
being too cerebral and in your head.

216
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,645
-Yeah.
-And, in fact, how is your head?

217
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,082
-You know, I was talking with her--
-See, that's it right there.

218
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,150
-You missed that joke.
-I missed--

219
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,053
Wait a minute. Stop it.
You have to listen.

220
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,056
I've said that to you several times.
"How is your head?"

221
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,859
The answer's roaming around,
but you have to listen.

222
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,730
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Miss Fame, how's your head?

223
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,532
Fine.

224
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,970
Are you kidding me?

225
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:10,242
No, but knock it out of the park.
Can't wait to see you as twins.

226
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,611
-Thank you, Ru.
-All right.

227
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,582
-Ginger and Sasha.
-Hey.

228
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,252
Isn't this crazy? It's totally wacko.

229
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,389
That's kind of how I feel.
I'm not gonna lie.

230
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:28,027
So you're not happy about this.
What is your strategy to win?

231
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,297
We said, "Let's do something
that's completely outside of the box,

232
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,532
and let's be joined at the nipples."

233
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,303
-Ex-squeeze me?
-Exactly.

234
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,273
Yeah, we want huge, huge boobs.

235
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,712
{\an8}Y'all better not try to have no kids.
No kids gonna suck on them titties.

236
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,683
-This is what keeps us together.
-This is gonna be quite interesting.

237
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:57,022
Girl, I'm worried. I feel
this looming presence over me saying,

238
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,361
"Something's about to knock you down
to the bottom, and this might be it."

239
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,968
All these hoes will make me feel
like it's day one all over again.

240
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,036
I know, day fucking one.

241
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:16,842
{\an8}We have to make up the bitches
that went home to be our conjoined twins.

242
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,412
-Katya.
-Hi.

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,615
-And Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-Hello, darling.

244
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,820
-This is your big chance to come back.
-I know.

245
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,924
-So what's your idea?
-We're aging hookers from Atlantic City.

246
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,561
-Aging hookers?
-We were born connected by our vaginas.

247
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:41,100
-But we make do with the other orifices.
-There's several other options.

248
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,537
And we have worked together,
which wasn't my best work.

249
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,741
That's right.
I don't mean to harp on negativity,

250
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,111
but you two worked together
when you got booted.

251
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:02,321
{\an8}We have worked together,
and it never really flowed that well.

252
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:08,127
We want to welcome... welcome you
to the first annual Despy Awards.

253
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,729
I'll let you get back to work.

254
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,466
-You have lots of conjoining to do.
-Conjoining.

255
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:19,204
If I have to go home,
and one of those eliminated whores stays,

256
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:25,110
I'm gonna have a wonderful time
going to their house and burning it down.

257
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,848
-Well, Kennedy and Jasmine.
-Hey.

258
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,451
Jasmine, how happy are you to be back?

259
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:37,456
As happy as a ship full of sailors
and one hot hooker.

260
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,825
-That's real happy!
-Yes.

261
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,326
Why did you choose Jasmine?

262
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,863
We come from the same background
as far as drag is concerned.

263
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,833
-Okay.
-And I can make her look like me.

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,303
If you're really good,
Jasmine gets to stay.

265
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,107
I would really like that.
She has a lot to offer.

266
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,043
I hope we are the winners,
so she can come back.

267
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,711
-Wow.
-We gonna whip it good.

268
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,613
Whip these hoes' asses, honey.

269
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,782
-Bitch, don't fuck it up.
-Yes, ma'am.

270
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,685
Get back to work,
and I'll see you in a minute.

271
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,786
-Right.
-Right.

272
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,489
You see where the fire is, all right.

273
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,758
Bitch, I'm back up in this piece.

274
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,795
-Tempest and Jaidynn.
-Hey, Ru.

275
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:22,201
I got to say, of all of the twins here,
you two are the oddest couple.

276
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,169
Yes, honey.

277
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,140
-What are you planning?
-We're gonna do some disco divas,

278
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,175
-some disco mammas.
-Really?

279
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:34,079
Our back story
is that our mamma was the whore of 54.

280
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:39,184
And then one night, she had
multiple partners that created us.

281
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:45,224
We wanted to play on our size differences,
so my "business" is in her back.

282
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,093
-[Jaidynn] Like this.
-[Tempest] You can see us both.

283
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,430
-This time, you got to bring it double.
-Double duty.

284
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,065
-Duty, duty, duty.
-Yes.

285
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,400
-Hashtag "double duty."
-Okay.

286
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,836
-We ready, boo.
-Get back to work.

287
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,571
-All right.
-Thanks, Ru.

288
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,641
We have to slay this,
because I ain't going home.

289
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,277
-Pearl and Trixie.
-Hi, Ru.

290
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,112
-Hi, RuPaul.
-Together again.

291
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,113
-I know.
-Again.

292
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,583
Let's see. Trixie, what more
do you have to show us?

293
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,688
Before I left in a lip-sync accident,
I was told by the judges,

294
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,560
"You're funny, but you're not going for
gold." And so that's what I want to do.

295
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,397
Every chance you step out on that stage
is your chance to do it.

296
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:30,903
There are no dress rehearsals in life. 
You've got to take those opportunities.

297
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,106
-So what's the strategy?
-There's always a prettier twin.

298
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,374
-Yeah.
-That's us.

299
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,313
We want to look related,
but possibly in an in-breeding accident.

300
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,985
All right, you kids get back to work.
Cannot wait to see your conjoined twins.

301
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,856
{\an8}I'm bringing everything I had before
with new fire under my ass,

302
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,493
because I know what it's like
to fucking lip-sync and go home.

303
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,062
It's not cute. It's not cute at all.

304
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,605
{\an8}[Violet] Is this you guys
making it sexy? Or very slutty.

305
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,643
That was a compliment, not a read.
Now I tell people when it's a compliment.

306
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,414
-You have changed the most.
-Do you think so?

307
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,916
-That was sarcasm.
-No, in a positive way.

308
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:22,621
{\an8}I am most impressed
with the change in Violet. I'm blown away.

309
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,992
{\an8}She's much nicer. She's not just biting
and sending out insults.

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,761
She's a contender,
and I think that's a great thing.

311
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,436
[Sasha] Temp, I'm so happy to see you.

312
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,771
{\an8}Can I get a cut?

313
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,008
[Sasha] Ooh, I like that fabric.

314
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,111
-Girl.
-[Sasha] How's the game been for you?

315
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:53,685
I'm pulling the look together
for the both of us. We should be a team.

316
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,221
-[Sasha] Are you insane yet?
-I was gagged.

317
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,190
[Violet] You have no idea.

318
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,493
Come with me.

319
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,298
I need to take a moment
to process my feelings

320
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,368
before I go all Yosemite Sam and explode.

321
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:14,172
I love Sasha, but she's not pulling
her weight. I'm not a sewer's sewer.

322
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,209
-I'm not good enough for two people.
-Yeah.

323
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,679
If I went home,
I wouldn't expect to be brought back.

324
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,114
They went home for a reason.

325
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,984
I'm just freaked out.

326
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,754
{\an8}[Jasmine] She look
like her nerves are bad.

327
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,355
{\an8}-Who?
-Ginger.

328
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,324
{\an8}She don't want none of us back.

329
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,194
This is the most nervous I've seen Ginger.

330
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,331
She's almost completely shutting down.

331
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,903
If I go home, I want it to be
because of something I did or didn't do.

332
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,706
We've really got to do something
to pull this together

333
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:55,047
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Back in the messy workroom.

334
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,581
Come on, wig.

335
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,252
{\an8}Today is our conjoined twin runway.

336
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,487
Someone's staying,
and it could possibly be Max.

337
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,459
-Are you ready for the challenge?
-I'm ready, honey.

338
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,461
-We're gonna be sickly now.
-Yes.

339
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,931
{\an8}It's awesome to be back
with my bitch Jasmine.

340
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,702
But she's been a lot of sadness
ever since she left.

341
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,604
I told her to hold her head up.

342
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,543
You still have your dignity.
You still are Jasmine Masters.

343
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:30,515
And Jasmine tells me that no one
has ever told her to keep her head up.

344
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,222
Bitch, if I get back up in here,
I'm slaying, bitch.

345
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,358
I ain't holding my shit back.

346
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:44,563
She had a bad run,
but everybody deserves a second chance,

347
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,333
and I do believe she has
a lot to offer this competition.

348
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:56,241
-Has anyone ever painted you before?
-No, especially someone who looks like me.

349
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,544
I'm thinking about what my sweet...

350
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,447
devout Mormon mother
is gonna be thinking about all this.

351
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,217
-She's never seen the show but...
-Oh, yeah?

352
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,654
I did the whole reparative therapy thing,
trying to turn straight.

353
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,423
-Oh, dear!
-Yeah.

354
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,992
I did the whole conversion
to be straight therapy.

355
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,131
It was horrible. It's all about,
"You've got to pray harder, fast harder,

356
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,768
and date girls." Like it's suddenly
gonna turn you straight.

357
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,704
-Damn.
-It nearly destroyed me.

358
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:31,176
{\an8}Talking about personal issues
and upbringings gives us an opportunity

359
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:38,083
to show those kids who are struggling
that there's someone who can empathize.

360
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,654
You know the suicide rate in gay kids
is way above the national average, right?

361
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,322
-It...
-It breaks your heart.

362
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,158
-It's crazy.
-It destroys lives.

363
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,095
Lucky for you, you had a realization
about who you were in reality.

364
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:55,133
It's kind of a miracle, and it's something
I'm really grateful for every day.

365
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,671
If you can help one kid
live another day, then it's worth it.

366
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,877
[Miss Fame] Is your mom
the closest person you have?

367
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,346
-Oh, yeah.
-Was she a single mom?

368
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:14,219
No. They broke up when I was young,
but she's been married for 16 years.

369
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,155
-[Trixie] Talking about your family?
-[Kandy] My step-father.

370
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,825
[Trixie] I had a step-dad too,
but we weren't close.

371
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,228
He was super abusive. I was over it.

372
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,431
The police actually took me out
of my home when I was 15.

373
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,335
-That's pretty sad.
-Yeah, it kind of sucked.

374
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:34,973
You don't really have a clear perception
of abuse, because it's all you know.

375
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,741
Right, exactly.

376
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,977
{\an8}I had a hard time with my step-dad.

377
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:43,548
If I was being too sensitive or acting
too feminine, he would call me a trixie.

378
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,287
For years, that was one of the worst words
I could think of, so I took that name

379
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,456
and it used to have all this hurt to it,

380
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:55,293
and I made it my drag name,
and now it's something I celebrate.

381
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,898
If I hadn't gone through all that shit,
Trixie Mattel might not even exist.

00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,124
-Honestly, I'm feeling this.
-She's gorgeous!

475
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,729
-I thought y'all told your story.
-Thank you so much.

476
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:10,201
But there was a lot of pressure to do
something that would make us bust a gut.

477
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:15,707
-And you didn't do that.
-Next up, Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle,

478
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,776
A.K.A. A Tale of Two Titties.

479
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,982
I love the idea.
I'm not crazy about the execution.

480
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,919
There's something white on the bottom
of your boobs, Ginger. What is it?

481
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,689
It might be hot glue.
I hot-glued this to me.

482
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,693
The boobs,
I wish they looked more like breasts.

483
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:42,033
Next up, Katya and her twin,
Mrs. Kasha Davis.

484
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,205
Listen, she's older than dirt,
but I know true talent when I smell it.

485
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,742
And she smells
like she just pissed herself.

486
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:56,180
I haven't laughed as hard
as I did tonight when you guys came up.

487
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,050
I've seen these women up at the casino
at the slot machines.

488
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,020
-The casino, the bingo hall.
-Yes!

489
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,090
-Sometimes you got to get ugly to win.
-High five. Ugly-beautiful.

490
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,662
-Miss Fame did our makeup. Can you tell?
-I know, she's so good!

491
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,731
Thank you, Katya. Thank you, ladies.

492
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,969
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

493
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:28,980
Between us quintuplets, what do you think?
Let's start with Miss Fame and Kandy Ho.

494
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,383
In this season, we've seen
a plastic surgery thing already.

495
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,086
Really, that's the best that you can do?

496
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:40,792
It's too easy, and the stakes
are too high to go so basic.

497
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,095
<i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce and Tempest DuJour.</i>

498
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,199
Standing next to the other queens
on this stage, it didn't stack up.

499
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,002
I wanted something more
and I think they could have brought it.

500
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,572
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport</i>
<i>and Jasmine Masters.</i>

501
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,376
I wish they'd gone over the top
with crowns, sashes, and flowers

502
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,845
and did the whole thing, over the top.

503
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,049
If they had connected at the head
or something a little weirder,

504
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,517
it would have worked better.

505
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:11,723
-[RuPaul] <i>Pearl and Trixie Mattel.</i>
-They were absolutely stunning.

506
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,027
-How fun was this?
-They were the best storytellers.

507
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,897
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki and Max.</i>
-They could've gone over the top,

508
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,500
but it would have taken away
from their beauty.

509
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:28,339
The biggest moment was me seeing Max
in a different light, and I loved that.

510
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,109
[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle.</i>

511
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,346
I couldn't get past the costume,
the construction.

512
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:41,919
I don't think I minded how shoddy it was
because it looked a bit like John Waters,

513
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,755
and that was always low-budget.

514
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:49,594
-But he attitude didn't sell that.
-It just felt, no pun intended, flat.

515
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,598
[RuPaul] <i>Katya and her sister,</i>
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>

516
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,202
They brought the funk and the fun.
They brought the house down.

517
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,572
-Not to mention they were conjoined...
-[both] At the vagina!

518
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,475
-[Ross] <i>Yeah.</i>
-What's better than that?

519
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:10,848
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

520
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,485
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

521
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:22,093
Pearl, as a conjoined twin,
the judges found you creepy and sad.

522
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,697
Pearl, condragulations.
You are the winner of this challenge.

523
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,968
Trixie Mattel, that means
you're back in the race, girl.

524
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,108
{\an8}I'm back, yay! I thought I was,
"Fourth episode, queen, bye."

525
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:41,446
I thought I was Mimi Imfurst.
Now I'm, "Me, me, I'm second chance."

526
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:47,685
Pearl, you've won your very own
custom website from Squarespace,

527
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:52,523
-plus a fabulous weekend in New York...
-Oh, hey!

528
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,426
...where you'll meet
with the Squarespace team

529
00:34:55,493 --> 00:35:01,432
-to make your portfolio and online store.
-Yes!

530
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:07,538
{\an8}This story has come full-circle,
taking Trixie out and bringing her back.

531
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,541
-Katya, you're safe.
-Thank you.

532
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,181
-Kennedy Davenport, you're safe.
-Yes!

533
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:26,557
Jaidynn, your disco inferno
did not set the judges' pussies on fire.

534
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,062
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.

535
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,300
Violet Chachki.

536
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,569
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

537
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:46,410
Miss Fame,
your plastic surgery story needed work.

538
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:52,283
Ginger Minj, you served tatas with hahas,

539
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,586
but the execution was... wah-wah.

540
00:35:56,454 --> 00:36:00,258
Ginger Minj, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

541
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:06,097
{\an8}Frankly, I'm not surprised.
Stevie Wonder could see this one coming.

542
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,332
[RuPaul] Miss Fame, you're safe.

543
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:15,439
Two sets of conjoined queens
stand before me.

544
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,945
Ladies, this is your last chance

545
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,582
to impress me and save yourselves...

546
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,584
from elimination.

547
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,054
The time has come...

548
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,723
for you to lip-sync...

549
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,460

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:07,467
It's time to make
some her-story.

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,100
- How you doing?
- Yee-haw.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,066
- Change for the Ritz.

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,867
- Everyone needs
peace with Latrice.

6
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:14,867
- I am of the people
and for the people.

7
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:18,233
I'm Sharon Needles
for sharing responsibilities.

8
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,400
- Condragulations.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,834
You are the winner
of this challenge.

10
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:26,767
Latrice Royale,
shantay, you stay.

11
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,867
Dida Ritz, sashay away.

12
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:31,367
- Thank you.

13
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:34,400
- Once again,
I've been criticized

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,333
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.

15
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,800
Michelle, I want you
to confer with Santino

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,767
to decide which one
of the eliminated queens...

17
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,433
deserves to return.

18
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,700
- No, bitch, top four.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,100
No mo' hos.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,767
-<i> And tonight...</i>

21
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,266
<i>the dolls meet their mamas.</i>

22
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,333
- Whoa.

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,934
- Man.

24
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,533
-<i> And it ain't pretty.</i>

25
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,900

- Don't what me.

00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,967
- "Stay true.
Chad, Needles, Latrice."

41
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:07,200
- Dida's gone, but she left
a little piece of herself

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,567
for us to remember her.

43
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,233
- all: Cheesecake!

44
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,400
- I'm gonna miss Dida.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,367
She was fierce!

46
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,367
- She was fierce.

47
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,800
- [indistinct]
- Love her.

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,266
- I had so much fun
getting to know her.

49
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,066
- We--yeah,
me and Dida connected.

50
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,734
<i>It's a bittersweet situation.</i>

51
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,767
<i>Yeah, one more bitch</i>
<i>is out the door,</i>

52
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,100
but Dida was my girl.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,367
- Were you nervous?

54
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,066
- You know, I thought
I was gonna be really nervous,

55
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,767
but after, like,
the first beat kicked in,

56
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,867
bitch, I was craving
for some show action.

57
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,066
- You were good.
You put Dida straight to bed.

58
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,200
You took us to church, she
took us to a BeyoncÃ© concert.

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,100
- Which is fine, but not
for Gladys Knight.

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,967
- Sometimes girls
give too much energy

61
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,200
for a song that just needs
some delicate, soulful moves.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
- That's it.
- You gave it.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,233
- So congratulations, Needles.

64
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, your third win.

65
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,300
- Oh, stop!

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,767
- Okay, so let's say this right
now so it's really official.

67
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,300
We are...

68
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,934
- all: The top four.

69
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,700
- So some shit's gonna go down.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,300
- No.

71
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,133
-<i> There will be a departed queen</i>

72
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,600
returning to the competition
this morning.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,900
Who do you think it's gonna be?

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,633
- Bringing anyone back
isn't fair in my opinion.

75
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,734
- We should make up some
shirts or some shit.

76
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,867
- Shirts, or, like, signs.

77
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,200
- Signs.
- Yes.

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,133
- Top four. Add no more.

79
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,233
- Let's do this, honey.

80
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,500
Let's get it all going.

81
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,300
This sucks,
and we're protesting.

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,233
Top four. Add no more.

83
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,633

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,734
<i>or a bastard of disaster?</i>

91
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,633
<i>Time to push, ladies.</i>

92
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>Push!</i>

Top four. Add no more.

Top four. Add no more.

102
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,467
- Whoo!

103
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,166
- Nice try, Norma Rae.

104
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:16,266
But this week we are celebrating
the modern drag family,

105
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:20,700
starting with the return
of one of your soul sisters.

106
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,066
Ladies, please welcome back...

107
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Oh, the suspense is killing me.

108
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,233
[cheers]

109
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,467
-<i> Kenya Michaels is back.</i>

110
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,533
- She's a force
to be reckoned with.

111
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,400
She can dance, and she's pretty.

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,700
And that's exactly
what we don't need right now.

113
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,166
- Welcome home, mama.

114
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,667
- Yeah, I'm ready.

115
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,066
I'm back in the building.

116
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,734
<i>I'm ready to compete.</i>

117
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,900
So let's prepare, ladies.

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,934
- Oh, pit crew.

119
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,300
For today's mini challenge,

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,433
you need to get crafty

121
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:08,467
and turn these papa bears
into mama bears.

122
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,934
You'll have 20 minutes
to drag out your teddy bear.

123
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:17,266
The one queen with the most
unbearably beautiful critter

124
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,066
will win.

125
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:22,633
Ready, set, growl.

126
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,900
Whoo-hoo.

127
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,400
- Better make
your spook bear, bitch.

128
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,867
Spoo...kity.

129
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,667
- Sorry, Kenya, we've lost
our fucking minds.

130
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,066
- Look what you left me with.

131
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,800
Now I'm not the youngest or
the shortest or the fishiest.

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,367
- And you never will be,
Blanche.

133
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,800
And you never were.

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,166
[laughs]

135
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,734
- Okay, ladies, time's up.

136
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,767
Let's take a look
at your lady bears.

137
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,767
- RuPaul, meet Malibu Bearbie.

138
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,800
- She's very Jiggly Caliente.
- Yes.

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,266
[laughter]

140
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,900
- May I call you Jiggly?

141
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,967
Next up, Sharon Needles.

142
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,433
The bride of Chucky wore black.

143
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,834
- She's part
of the Scare Bear collection.

144
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,633
I let her borrow my contacts.

145
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,133
- So who do we have here?

146
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,066
- We have La Transbear.

147
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,767
- Are those pasties
she has there?

148
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,166
- Yeah, her pasties are sexy.

149
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,500
- She is a fishy bear,
and bears love fish.

150
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,734
- This is Portia the Pooh.

151
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,800
- I see that her face
is bejeweled.

152
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,433
- Like mother, like daughter.

153
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,233
- This is Princess Bitch Bear.

154
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,800
She comes complete
with a set of accessories.

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,734
- Booger Bear.

156
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,934
- Those are all
jealous bears over there.

157
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:49,066
- Ladies, one bear
is creating a panda-monium.

158
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,133
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

159
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,667
Lil' Kenya Michaels.

160
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,900
- Yay.

161
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,166
-<i> Yes, I win.</i>

162
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,633
La Transbear.

163
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,633
- But, ladies, you can all
be proud of your work,

164
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,133
because all
of your dragged-out bears

165
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,166
will be auctioned off

166
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,834
by the Bear to Make
a Difference Project...

167
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,233
- all: Aww.

168
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:20,200
- Which supports
the Matthew Shepard Foundation's

169
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,934
effort to erase hate.

170
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,400
Can I get a amen in here?

171
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,066
- all: Amen.

172
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,834
- ["elderly" voice] Ladies,
when I was growing up,

173
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,633
a man went to work...

174
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,700
[normal] And left his wife
at home to raise the children.

175
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,667
But in today's modern families,

176
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,133
we expect a lot more
from our father figures.

177
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,867
Now, to prove my point,

178
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:46,567
I want you to meet some DILFs.

179
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,433
Or dads I'd like to frock.

180
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,233
[laughter]

181
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,934
- Whoa.

182
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:01,900
<i>Truck-driving, burly men, like,</i>

183
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,166
for real, for real.

184
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,533
[chuckles]

185
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,100
- Ladies, for today's
main challenge,

186
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,967
you need to transform
these handsome daddies

187
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:17,734
into sexy drag queen mamas.

188
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,633
All right, dads,
please introduce yourselves.

189
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,967
- I'm Leland,
the father of six.

190
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,467
- Six?
- Yes.

191
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,934
- Damn, Leland.

192
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,567
- Hi, I'm Rick, and I have
a beautiful daughter.

193
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,767
She's six years old.

194
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,667
And a beautiful son.
He's four years old.

195
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,800
- My name's James.

196
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
I have a beautiful
two-year-old daughter.

197
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,567
- My name's Chris.

198
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,533
I'm a proud father
of two beautiful girls.

199
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,667
- My name is Mike.

200
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,633
I have six children
and five grandchildren.

201
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,533
- Wow, so you're a grandfather
I'd like to frock.

202
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,467
- I am.

203
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,967
- All right, Lil' Kenya.

204
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,200
Since you won the mini
challenge,

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,934
you get to pick a daddy
for each of the other girls.

206
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,734
- You go with Chad Michaels.

207
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,500
- I'm looking at Kenya,
and I'm kind of doing,

208
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,066
like, the eye thing,
so that way she knows,

209
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,867
like, to send the guy
this way or this way.

210
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,633
- You're gonna go...

211
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,767
- When she comes
to pick out my guy,

212
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,133
I just give her,
like, a little nod,

213
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,066
so that way she just comes
and gives me my guy.

214
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,166
- With Phi Phi.

215
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,533
Um...

216
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,233
You're gonna be spooky.
- Okay.

217
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,266
- Hi.
Sharon Needles.

218
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,700
- The guy that I have been given

219
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,433
has the brickest face
in the bunch.

220
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,967
He's too manly to be pretty.

221
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,600
- How are you?
- Good.

222
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,467
- Leland is with Latrice.

223
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,066
So, Lil' Kenya,
who's your daddy?

224
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:40,567
- This is my daddy.
- [giggles]

225
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,100
- My guy is the most
beautiful woman.

226
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,800
Because he's gonna look
like Jessica Wild something.

227
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,233
- Now you can use your own drag,

228
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,066
plus extra materials and hair,

00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,367
courtesy of Risque Wigs.

230
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:59,100
Now I'm expecting to see
a strong family resemblance.

231
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,867
And tomorrow, on the main stage,

232
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,867
to keep things in a family way,

233
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,333
you and your daddy mama

234
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,767
will be carrying
a bun in the oven.

235
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,734
- [laughs]
- That's right.

236
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,567
The category is...

237
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,433
baby bump realness.

238
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:20,100
-<i> It's one thing</i>
<i>to put these dads in drag.</i>

239
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,700
<i>But now it got to be</i>
<i>maternity clothes?</i>

240
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,867
<i>You gonna be pregnant?</i>

241
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:23,867
Ugh.

242
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,700
- Okay, little mamas,

243
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,433
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

244
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,600
got you into this situation.

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,834
Now you need to use it
to turn it out.

246
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,767
Gentlemen, start your engines.

247
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:44,934
And may the best mother win.

248
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,433
- All right, come on.

249
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,600
- How do you call--
what do you call 'em?

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
- These are sequins.
- Sequins.

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,200
- I didn't even know
they made stuff like this.

252
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,533
- Is that your cell phone in
your pants

253
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,533
or are you just happy to see me?

254
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,767
- Nope.
- Okay.

255
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,934
Didn't told me I was
in the movie<i> Anaconda.</i>

256
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,867
What's going on here?
- Oh, my God.

257
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,500
This one's a freak.

258
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,433
Mike-o the Psycho is so weird.

259
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,066
- Ooh, baby.
- [chuckles]

260
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,600
- He makes me want to run
and take a shower immediately.

261
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,266
- You single?

262
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,967
- Not today.

263
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,600
- Sharon's DILF
looks freakin' insane.

264
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
He's like<i> the</i>
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i><span style="bodyStyle"> killer.</i>

265
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
- So we got to get you pregnant.

266
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,233
- Why do we have to be pregnant?

267
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:32,200
Today we have to turn DILFs
into MILFs--

268
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
<i>pregnant, glamorous MILFs.</i>

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,333
- Man.

270
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,333
Ugh.

271
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,066
- You have to get rid
of your manhood.

272
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,500
- But that will hurt.

273
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,633
- No, it doesn't hurt.

274
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:44,800
- If you push 'em
up inside you--

275
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,934
- Nah, it's--
that's where they go.

276
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,433
- Ooh!

277
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,767
- It's either that or you can
sit on 'em, and that's not--

278
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,700
- Sit on--oh, shit, no!
- Exactly, so...

279
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,200
- You can't--you tape it to your
leg or something like that?

280
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,233
[laughing]

281
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,467
- You gonna be serving
moose knuckles.

282
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,433
- So they want to see,
like, the transformation,

283
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,400
like, the difference.

284
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,133
And you'd look like a dude.

285
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,867
- Pretty manly man.

286
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,967
- I get paired up with Chris,
and I'm super excited,

287
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,734
because he's really
getting into this.

288
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,233
- I'm down to go all the way.
- Awesome.

289
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,367
- I want to win this shit.

290
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,667
- It's kind of fun
teaching a straight guy

291
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,633
how to be me.

292
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,633
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, you?

293
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,867
- Good.
- Don't talk to my dad.

294
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,200
- I can talk to your dad
if I want.

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,066
- All right?
Maybe your dad likes me better.

296
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,600
- He wants to be on the winning
team, so I doubt it.

297
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,767
- Yeah.
'Cause we're gonna win.

298
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,967
- You like that?
He even talks like Phi Phi.

299
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,667
- I was like,
"You're just like me."

300
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,867
That's what I like, 'cause
that way I can school these hos.

301
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:33,934
- Phi Phi loves to come for me,

302
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,367
and she can come for me
all she wants.

303
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,367
Come for me, baby.

304
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,533
<i>However,</i>
<i>I have to stay focused.</i>

305
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,734
What I'm producing
has to be perfect.

306
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:43,734
- No, that's way too bright.

307
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,967
I don't like the fact
that it's so long.

308
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,867
- 'Cause I'm thinking,
like, right about here.

309
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,200
Show some hip.

310
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,400
- He could chill out
just a little bit,

311
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
'cause I do know
what I'm doing,

312
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,834
and I don't need
too much direction.

313
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,600
- I want, like, a four-inch...

314
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,433
Bam!

315
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,967
- Walk.
Come on, walk.

316
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,500
Okay.
Okay, don't bounce.

317
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,066
Don't do that.
No, don't do that.

318
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,834
Okay, come on.
Walk, walk.

319
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:04,800
How you feel?

320
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
- Like, it--
it just--

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,333
Is that how they usually feel?

322
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,633
Like, hurting here?
- Yeah.

323
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,834
All the time.
- All the time?

324
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,800
- Yeah, all the time.

325
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
- My toes are
like this right now.

326
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,734
[laughs]
Yeah, I know,

327
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,633
because you have a men feet.

328
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,700
[laughing]

329
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,066
- Ah, fuck,
these shoes fucking hurt.

330
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,500
- Walk in the fucking heels
and then shut up!

331
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,266
- I might as well
level with you.

332
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,500
- Yeah.

333
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,600
- All these girls here
are like classic beauty queens.

334
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,300
I like to look kind of, like,
half dead most of the time.

335
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,066
- Who am I to judge anybody?

336
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,100
- Do you have both your shoes?

337
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
- The way I look at it,
go big or stay home.

338
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,133
- Right.
- Right?

339
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:39,200
- Agreed.

340
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>- Sharon Needles' DILF</i>

341
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,233
<i>is really, really</i>
<i>rough in the face.</i>

342
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,600
- Well, what do you
do for a living?

343
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,800
What makes you so strong?

344
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
- I was a sheriff's deputy.

345
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,400
- Oh! I see.

346
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,567
Law enforcement?

347
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,734
- So don't step out of line

348
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,400
or I'm gonna throw
the handcuffs on you.

349
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,600
- Oh, got it, got it.

350
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Challenges either
go two ways with me:

351
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,667
I either feel
ridiculously confident...

352
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,767
- No, no.
Don't be so out.

353
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,633
- Yeah, you don't want
to walk like that.

354
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,400
-<i> Or I know I'm up the shit</i>
<i>crick without a paddle.</i>

355
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,066
Feel your ass
going back and forth.

356
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,066
<i>- Wow.</i>

357
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,333
<i>Sharon, mama,</i>

358
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,266
you may be in trouble.

359
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,867
- Foot in front of foot,
crossing over.

360
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,066
- Sharon, he walks
just like you already, girl.

361
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:23,600
[laughing]

362
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,967
- Hello, hello, hello!

363
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,633
- Hey, Ru.
- Oh, Ru!

364
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,100
- Well, hello, Phi Phi.

365
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,233
- Hi, Ru.
- And Chris.

366
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,834
Apparently you're
making your outfits?

367
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,266
- We want to be,
like, sexy moms.

368
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,567
We're gonna have, like, fun,
flirty little pregnant dresses.

369
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,600
- You've been criticized
for proportions.

370
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,133
- I'll be fine.
It'll work.

371
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,467
I get worried when you do that,

372
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,667
"Oh, it's gonna be fine."

373
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,066
- I know you do.
- "It'll work. It'll work.

374
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,066
It'll be fine."

375
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,166
Remember, there have been times

376
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,400
when you've done that
and it didn't work.

377
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,967
Now, do you think
you have enough time

378
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,100
to finish sewing these outfits?

379
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,400
- Yeah.
It's not gonna take long.

380
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
There's that thing again.

381
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,066
"It'll be fine."
- Stop it!

382
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,066
No, we're gonna be good.

383
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,433
- Get to sewing.
- All righty.

384
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,400
Thank you, Ru.
- All right.

385
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,166
- Hi, Leland.
Hi, Latrice.

386
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,166
- Hello, Ru.

387
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,066
- Will you be wearing
matching gowns?

388
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,900
- Um, well...

389
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
- We're looking
for a family resemblance.

390
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,633
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

391
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,233
- But it's gonna
work out, I think.

392
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,500
- So, Leland,

393
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,133
what are you most nervous about?

394
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,333
- Walking in them shoes.

395
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,900
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,133
- You play sports at all?

397
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,166
- I used to.

398
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,367
- Yeah, well, because, honestly,

399
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,600
it has to do with
your center of gravity

400
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,500
and knowing your body
and your hand-eye coordination.

401
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,834
- Still ain't got no
coordination for basketball

402
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,100
with dribbling and--no, no.

403
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,934
- Right. Hmm.

404
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:35,066
All right, Royale sisters,

405
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,300
you have a lot of work to do.

406
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,367
I'm gonna leave you to it.

407
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,066
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.

408
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,600
- Hey, Rick.
- Hi.

409
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,500
- Hey, Lil' Kenya.

410
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,567
You look like Elvis.

411
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,734
Do people tell you that?

412
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,900
- My mom told me I look
like a young Elvis, yeah.

413
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,500
- Now you're gonna look
like Lisa Marie Presley.

414
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,200
Have you picked
a drag name for Rick?

415
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,834
- She gonna be my Lil' Mama.

416
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,066
- Lil' Mama.
- Because I'm Lil' Kenya.

417
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,166
[laughs]

418
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,700
- How do you feel
about that, Lil' Mama?

419
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,066
- Uh...I don't feel
like a little mama.

420
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,133
- Well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.

421
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,200
Let them have it.

422
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,133
- Bye.

423
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,500
- Hey, Chad.
- Hey, RuPaul.

424
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,333
- Wow, look at this.
- Isn't that fun?

425
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,633
- Yeah, it was both our idea.

426
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,700
We're both very technical people
when we start out--

427
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,400
"Is it off? It is doing this?
Doing that?"

428
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,700
- He's taking a very
active role in this,

429
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,066
and he's very assertive.

430
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,800
- Now you've been doing this
for a long time.

431
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,066
Can you look at James' face

432
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,867
and tell what he's
gonna look like

433
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,133
just based on bone structure?

434
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,066
- Yeah, he's gonna be pretty.
- Really?

435
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,867
- We'll see.

436
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,500
- I'm gonna let you get
back to it, okay?

437
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
- Thank you.

438
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,066
- Mike and Sharon Needles.
- Hello.

439
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,800
- How are you two kids
getting along?

440
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,100
Mike, you're getting into it
early, aren't you?

441
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,266
- Oh.

442
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,633
<i>I'm embarrassed by Mike</i>

443
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,600
because he seems
to have no filter.

444
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
- Why'd you decide to do this?

445
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
- 'Cause I want to bring out
my inner diva.

446
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,433
The only problem I have
with this outfit

447
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,367
is I think I'm having a baby
elephant.

448
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,133
You want to see his trunk?

449
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,900
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.

450
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,567
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

451
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,066
Good luck taming Mike.

452
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,333
- Thank you so much, Ru.

453
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,367
- Gather round.

454
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

455
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
tomorrow night we'll be joined

456
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,066
by our extra-special
guest judges,

457
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,867
one of TV's favorite dads...

458
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,133
<i>Modern Family's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

459
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,133
- Yeah!

460
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,667
- He's cute as a button.

461
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,500
- And the always lovely

462
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,233
Miss Jennifer Love Hewitt.

463
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,233
[gasps and exclamations]

464
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,233
But before you have a baby...

465
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,133
there needs to be
a little seduction.

466
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:41,367
So tomorrow, prior to your baby
bump runway presentation,

467
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:44,867
each couple needs
to get us in the mood

468
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:48,367
with a sexy striptease.

469
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,400
- What?

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,133
- Insane.

471
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:57,200
- And, in the words
of my sainted mother...

472
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,066
God damn it, you pussy-mouthed
motherfuckers...

473
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,533
Don't fuck it up.

474
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,066
- Welcome to the runway.
- Awesome.

475
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,133
- It's time for me and James
to do our striptease,

476
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,567
and I'm a little apprehensive.

477
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,367
- We just have to figure out
how to make it sexy,

478
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,233
'cause it's supposed to be
like a striptease.

479
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,066
That's not turning me on yet,
dude.

480
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,233
-<i> I figured, with James,</i>

481
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,066
<i>since he doesn't have</i>
<i>a lot of experience,</i>

482
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,066
<i>you keep it simple.</i>

483
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,867
Walk out, looking at each other.

484
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,400
Then let's hit.

485
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,166
So your arm's gonna go up on--

486
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,266
your right arm.

487
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,100
And you know how I like
to be perfect, darling.

488
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,300
Boom, and then throw it.

489
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,900
You've never stripped before,
I'm sure.

490
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,066
- No.

491
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,200
- You've been
to a strip joint, though.

492
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,166
- Yeah.
- Lap dance?

493
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,266
- Oh, yeah.
- Tipping?

494
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,233
- Yeah.
- Poles?

495
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,200
- Yeah.
- All of it. All right.

496
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,533
Hold right, and then boom.
Perfect.

497
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,266
Real sexy, hands on hips.

498
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:46,734
Right to the X right here.

499
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,367
Pose. Perfect.

500
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:49,967
Just work your sexiness.

501
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,066
Like this. Look.

502
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,867
Ah.
- Okay.

503
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,867
- Perfect.

504
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,367
Just up. Perfect.

505
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,400
Give me five, brother.

506
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
- Got it.
- That's my man.

507
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,066
- You're gonna win.
- I hope so.

508
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,066
- So cross out.

509
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,500
- Wait, wait,
I didn't even cross.

510
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I think I feel like
I'm walking off the stage.

511
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,867
- One, two, three, four.

512
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,900
Five, six...
- Oh, fuck.

513
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,467
That's all right, I got to
get used to the spin.

514
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,367
- It's kind of difficult
to transform, like,

515
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,834
a big, old, macho straight guy

516
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,333
into, like,
a real feminine woman.

517
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,333
Five, six, grab it.

518
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,800
Seven, eight.

519
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,934
- Five, six.

520
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,834
Oh, no, wait.

521
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:26,567
-<i> No, that's clearly a dude.</i>

522
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,600
- I feel like I'm
doing the Hulkamania.

523
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,367
Rrr!
[chuckles]

524
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,533
- Do you know what fishy means?
Like a girl.

525
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,166
Like, "ay!"

526
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,333
- Yeah!

527
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,967
- Kiss. Boom.
- Boom.

528
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,133
- No, you said boom after me.

529
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,900
That means you're
not timing with me.

530
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,700
- Uh...

531
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,066
back?

532
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,233
I know I should have saved my
brain cells when I was a kid.

533
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,400
- That's no excuse.

534
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Turning. Now what?

535
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,433
- I'm fucking brain-dead, dude.

536
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,800
- I want to kill him,

537
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,967
<i>because I have created</i>
<i>the most simplest,</i>

538
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,700
<i>cheapest routine</i>

539
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,767
that Helen Keller could do
on the first try.

540
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,633
Can you skip?
- Nope.

541
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,633
- I'm panicking.

542
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,367
- I suck. It is what it is.

543
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:15,467
- Don't say, "it is what it is,"

544
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,667
'cause it's my 100,000
fucking dollars.

545
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:22,066
I need to make sure
that he's giving 100%.

546
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:26,533
<i>But I don't think</i>
<i>I'm going to get it.</i>

547
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,900
- You okay?

548
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,633
- It's coming alive now.

549
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,033
There she go.

550
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,333
You know who you look like
right now?

551
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,333
Rick James.

552
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,934
[laughter]

553
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,934
- You're trying to make me look
like Teena Marie, though.

554
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,467
[laughter]

555
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,233
- Hold on.
I dropped my bush.

556
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,934
-<i> Sharon's DILF</i>
<i>is a cross-dressing,</i>

557
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:53,200
support-group-needing dad.

558
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
- Mm.
[inhales]

559
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
- No, no, no, no.

560
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,433
We don't fetishize the clothes.

561
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,967
- He's a little bit
too comfortable,

562
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,500
if you know what I mean.

563
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,767
- What if one of your daughters
grew up to be gay?

564
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:04,734
What would you tell them?

565
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,767
- I wouldn't care.

566
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,133
- You wouldn't care at all?
- No.

567
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,200
Even if I had a son.

568
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,767
- That's good.
- It is what it is.

569
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,533
- But that's good
that you wouldn't

570
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,133
shun your kids or anything.

571
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,734
My dad, he didn't
like it at all.

572
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:15,967
- That sucks.

573
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:19,700
- I haven't talked to him
since I was, like, 18.

574
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,667
- One day he'll realize
what he's not being part of.

575
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,700
-<i> It's really cool to talk</i>
<i>to someone that, you know,</i>

576
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,467
they're straight but they see
how my lifestyle is

577
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,266
and it's okay to be who I am.

578
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,600
If you had a son,

579
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,567
would you have him audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

580
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,767
- No, 'cause he'll probably do
a better job than I do.

581
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:39,800
- Do you have a boyfriend?

582
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,367
- I do. Yeah.
- How long?

583
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,400
- Eight years, and I was here
during our anniversary.

584
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,467
- On our eighth-year
anniversary,

585
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,834
we renewed our vows.

586
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,533
- Well, we might renew our vows
if we can ever get married.

587
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,700
- Why call it a marriage

588
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,133
if you're gonna
offend so many people?

589
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,767
- It's making everybody equal.

590
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,100
Say I've been together
with somebody for 40 years.

591
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,133
Say I get sick.

592
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,233
I go into the hospital.

593
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,867
They can't come visit me,

594
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,433
because they're not
related to me in any way.

595
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,934
So that's what
we're fighting for.

596
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:06,433
- That's what you're
standing up and saying.

597
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,633
- That would kill me to know,

598
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,066
if I was sick,
laying in a bed somewhere,

599
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,533
that Adam couldn't come see me.

600
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,333
No, it's cool.
I just, you know.

601
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,633
It just comes up, you know.

602
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,166
It's like--just to know that,

603
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,300
God, he would be locked out

604
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,934
and that he would be
left with nothing.

605
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,667
- I don't believe
that's fair at all.

606
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,734
I support you guys.

607
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:23,767
Everybody should have the right

608
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,467
to love who they want
to love, you know?

609
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,100
- You expect me to walk up
on this thing in these?

610
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,400
- Yeah.

611
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,867
Put on them shoes, boo-boo.
- [groans]

612
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,500
I can't even
walk on it barefoot.

613
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,934
Ooh. [laughs]

614
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,433
[exhales]
Okay.

615
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,867
- Tell me you got some rhythm.

616
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:47,066
- I got some rhythm, but I don't
know if I got any sexiness.

617
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,066
Oh!

618
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,867
<i>- I need sexy swagger.</i>

619
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,533
<i>I need hips and ass,</i>

620
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,867
and he don't have
none of that going.

621
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,400
- Whoa.

622
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,333
- You're okay with your shoes?
- Yeah.

623
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,066
Do I need 'em right now?
- You have to practice.

624
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:04,767
Come on.

625
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,166
One and two, the chair.

626
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,767
The legs.
Ha, ha, ha.

627
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,367
I do the split.

628
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,333
He need to be sexy.

629
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,734
Come on.
One more time.

630
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:19,367
Five, six, seven.

631
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,867
[speaks indistinctly]

632
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,934
<i>Rick is a hot guy,</i>
<i>but he's not a dancer.</i>

633
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,734
- That's it?

634
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:27,066
- Oh, my god.

635
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,066
- Pfft!

636
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,834
- One, two, three, four.

637
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,767
It's the end of the day,

638
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,066
<i>and I'm panicking,</i>

639
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,266
<i>because we have</i>
<i>a short window of time</i>

to get something so simple done.

641
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,633
Since you're strong,

642
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,100
what if I turned around
and you caught me?

643
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,433
- Yeah, let's make it
more difficult.

644
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,700
- Yeah.

645
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,367
- Ladies, can you vacate
our runway, please?

646
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,700
- "Vacate our runway."

647
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,233
- Get the fuck off our runway.

648
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,166
- We're better off than them.

649
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,500
- Don't make up excuses why
you guys are inferior to us.

650
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,633
- Well, their dance techniques
are bitchin'.

651
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:01,133
- Not really.

652
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,900

too much testosterone

653

running around here, sunshine.

654
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,667
- Why are you getting
such a bad attitude right now?

655
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,834
- Because I got
my diva bitch attitude,

656
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:10,800
and we're gonna win it,

657
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,100
and you guys
need to just stay home.

658
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,700

it's your diva bitch attitude.

- Yeah, just stay home.

660

- Bitch, I didn't come here
to stay home, "ossifer".

661
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,767
What?
What are you gonna do to me?

662

I'll fucking put you
in jail too.

laughs at your shit but you.

666
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,066
Can't take it, huh?

667

- I just did, didn't I?

675
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,433

need to be fucking removed

motherfucking attitude.

677

bitch talk to me like this?

680
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,867

- Do not call my sister a bitch.

ready for the runway.

689
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,133
- I stirred
the shit up yesterday.

690

I wanted to give 'em
something to think about.

691
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,700
A little drag queen drama.

692
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,233
- Inescapable.

693
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,934
- So let me ask you a question.

694
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,333
Were you ever bullied in school?

695
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,200
- Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

696
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,367
It was terrible.

697
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,734
You know, they'd wait for me
after school

698
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:41,066
and, like, beat me up.

699
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,967
- I mean, is this anything
you could report to the police?

700
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,133
- I never wanted to report it,

701
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,500
'cause I was embarrassed.

702
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,066
- Man, I'm sorry.

703
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,166
That's got to be
so frickin' hard, man.

704
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,633
You know, I'm learning
a lot about the world.

705
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,600
-<i> As much as I rag on Mike,</i>

706
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,867
<i>he certainly was sympathetic</i>

707
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:59,100
<i>to the fact that I went through</i>
<i>a lot of hell growing up.</i>

708
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,533
Still doesn't know
how to fucking dance.

709
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,700
- Dude, it's already squashed.

710
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,934
- Yeah, yeah.

711
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:06,367
I need to put tape.
Let me finish.

712
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,100
- No, I'm not taping my dick.

713
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,066
- Just tuck it back.
It don't feel that bad.

714
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,300
It's okay.

715
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,633
<i>- I remember a friend</i>
<i>in high school tucking</i>

716
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,533
<i>after he saw</i>
Silence of the Lambs.

717
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,066
Ugh!

718
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,867
- Let me see.

719
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,333
<i>Rick can't tuck himself.</i>

720
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,266
I have to...

721
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,467
- What about the balls?

722
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,533
- You can take your dick
from the back and pull up.

723
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,333
- Like that?
- No. More.

724
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,633
- It's gonna look like a tail.

725
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,734
- [laughs]

726
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,100
- Put it on the side
of the balls?

727
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,433
- It's from back.

728
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,734
- I think the balls are too big.

729
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:40,800
- [laughs]

730
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,700
I'm sorry.

731
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,133
- I'm really glad I didn't have
to kick your ass yesterday.

732
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,600
- It was all in a good time,
you know.

733
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,166
I just--I may have pushed the
envelope a little too far,

734
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,700
but I was totally joking.

735
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,734
- It's all right.

736
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,066
I needed to blow
some steam off anyway.

737
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,066
- Well, it's good.
You can use me for that.

738
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,767
I have a really good poker face.

739
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,133
I was cracking up inside.

740
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,433
- I'm sure you were.

741
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,867
- Ain't no fun
if there ain't no drama.

742
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,300
That's the way I look at it.

743
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,233
- [giggles maniacally]

Hey, guys.

750
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,266
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, gorgeous.

751
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:30,834

Michelle Visage. Hi, mami.

753
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,166
- How are you, baby?
We match tonight.

754
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:37,333
- And we're all eating
at red lobster.

755
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,333
- Mm-mm.

756
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,266
- Santino Rice.

757
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,700
- Great to be here, Ru.

758
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,433
- And look who
the stork brought.

759
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:45,734
It's Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

760
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:46,834
- Hi, Ru.

761
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,433
- Are you ready
to meet my modern family?

762
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:50,900
- Bring 'em on. All of 'em.

763
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,400
- [laughs]

764
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,467
Jennifer Love Hewitt,
welcome to our blessed event.

765
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,900
- Thank you for having me. Hi.

766
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
- Will you be
our drag whisperer?

767
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,166
- Yes.

768
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,600
[laughter]

769
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,900
- This week,
the queens were challenged

770
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,967
to transform real-life daddies
into sexy drag mamas.

771
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,600
They'll perform
a seductive striptease

772
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,200
before they rock-a-bye
the runway

773
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,100
wearing their best
baby bump eleganza.

774
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,533
Gentlemen, start your engines.

775
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,967
And may the best woman win.

776
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:42,433
- Whoo-hoo!

777
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:49,400
- Oh, yeah!

778
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,467
-<i> We're doing the choreography.</i>

779
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,767
Rick know the choreography,

780
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,333
but Rick's not sexy.

781
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,767
-<i> It's like dancing with</i>
<i>Leslie Nielsen in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Airplane!</i>

782
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,667
<i>That's what I thought</i>
<i>he looked like.</i>

783
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,867
- [laughs]

784
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,233
-<i> Leland's missing</i>
<i>a couple of cues,</i>

785
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,533
<i>but I'm not worried about it.</i>

786
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,400
<i>We're working it out</i>
<i>the best way we can.</i>

787
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:10,100
- Oh, yeah.

788
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,333
-<i> It's top five,</i>

789
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>so the judges</i>
<i>are gonna look for anything</i>

790
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,066
<i>to put us in the bottom,</i>

791
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,567
<i>so I hope that our routine</i>
<i>was good enough to get us by.</i>

792
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,967
[cheers and applause]

793
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:30,200
- Let the baby
bump parade begin.

794
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,500
- Sharelle and Latrice Royale.

795
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,533
- The water has broken, honey.

796
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,066
- Oh, Lord.

797
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,734
- You better get
Lamaze over here.

798
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:41,967
- Nine months later.

799
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,967
-<i> If you're part</i>
<i>of the Royale family,</i>

800
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,700
<i>you're definitely</i>
<i>gonna be a glamour girl.</i>

801
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,066
<i>So Leland's looking</i>
<i>very elegant, very lady.</i>

802
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:50,867
<i>He's looking gorgeous.</i>

803
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:54,133
- She didn't know
she was pregnant.

804
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:57,166
Gi Gi and Phi Phi O'Hara.

805

<i>I kind of feel like he was</i>
<i>a drag queen in a past life,</i>

811
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,700
<i>because he's</i>
<i>doing this too good.</i>

812
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,500
- It's a boy.
It's a girl.

813
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,700
It's both.
[laughter]

814
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,166

- Being pregnant's hard.

818
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,633
- Macabre too apparently.
- Yeah.

819
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,033
- We're in this together, mom.

820
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:26,734
-<i> I know that Rick</i>
<i>gonna be a man,</i>

821
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,800
<i>and I think, okay,</i>
<i>if Rick gonna be a man,</i>

822
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,834
<i>gonna be a beautiful man.</i>

823
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,033
- Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian.

824
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,400

- Next up, Robin Mansions
and Sharon Needles.

826

Honey, they're having
Rosemary's Baby.

827
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,867
- My other eye
is my good judgment eye.

828
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:47,266
-<i> Me and Robin are serving up</i>
<i>filthy-ass bad girls.</i>

829
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:49,233
<i>Who slept with Robin?</i>

830
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:50,667
<i>Who got her pregnant?</i>

831
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,834
- Is this morning sickness
or is she gagging on her beauty?

832
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:56,967
- Apparently, Marilyn Manson
does have a uterus.

833
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:00,133
- Lady Samantha
and Chad Michaels.

834
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,400
Now, that is an immaculate
misconception.

835
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,600

- It's a very long child.

841
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,667
- It is a tall one.

842
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,900
My cervix is softening
just watching.

843
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,700
- Is it?
Mwah.

844
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,900
Welcome, ladies.

845
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,667
First up, Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.

846
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,166

- Hi, judges.

847
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,700
- Let's take a look at Lady
Samantha's before pictures.

848
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,433
That's James.

849
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,834
And, baby, look at you now.

850
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,834
Did you tuck?
- A little bit, yes.

851
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,066
- Oh.

852
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,767
- How do you tuck
just a little bit?

853
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,533
- Yeah, just push things around.

854
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,867
- Like, just between
your cheek and gums?

855
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,367
- Yes, sir.
[laughter]

856
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:56,333
- Yes, ma'am. It's yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

857
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,667
- I have to say, James,

858
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,633
Lady Samantha if you're nasty,

859
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:01,333
I think you're wearing
the highest heels

860
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,467
on the catwalk here,

861
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,367
which I think
should not go unrecognized.

862
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,100
Very impressive.
- Thank you. Thank you.

863
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,767
- James, I love that you
were almost, like,

864
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,400
put out with how hot you were.

865
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
[laughs]

866
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,533
I thought that was really great.

867
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,800
I'd like to adopt that quality.

868
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,400
- So, James,
would you schtup you?

869
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,934
- Oh, yeah.
[laughter]

870
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:22,834
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Robin Mansions.

871
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,700
That's Mike.

872
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,066
And now look at you.

873
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,767
What's your favorite part
of the drag getup?

874
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:33,066
- He seemed to be very occupied
by my breast plate.

875
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,500
- Oh.
- Liked it.

876
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,967
- Is Mike wearing it now?
- No.

877
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,200
- I swallowed half of it.
[laughter]

878
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,467
- I'm getting, like,
an Al Pacino in drag thing,

879
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,633
and not in a good way.
[laughter]

880
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:46,266
- Robin Mansions' face
repels beauty.

881
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,266
And I love that.

882
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,867
Nothing makes
a woman feel prettier

883
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,066
than standing
next to this one over here.

884
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,967
- Well, that's why I hang out
with Michelle Visage.

885
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,300
[laughter]

886
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,367
All right, next up,

887
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,433
Phi Phi O'Hara and Gi Gi.

888
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,467
Wow, that's Chris.

889
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,133
Now you are Gi Gi.

890
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,600
You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.

891
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,367
- What was the hardest part
of the striptease?

892
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,667
- Being fully tucked
and walking in high heels.

893
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,066
- So you were fully tucked?

894
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,767
- I had the elephant all the way
back towards the waterhole.

895
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,900
- Oh, really?

896
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,233
- I liked seeing
the resemblance.

897
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,500
- You look like you share DNA.

898
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,433
You look fantastic.

899
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,467
Great job there.

900
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,066
- I have such a girl crush
on both of you.

901
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,967
- What was the most
difficult part

902
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,333
of working with your daddy mama?

903
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,066
- We really worked
well together.

904
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,066
He's like an inspiration
of what everybody should be.

905
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,633
He's an open-minded,
heterosexual male

906
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:37,533
that just values people
for who they are,

907
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,533
doesn't judge a book
by its cover.

908
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,133
My dad's not like that.

909
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,166
If I could have a dad like him,

910
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,166
my life would probably
be a lot easier,

911
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,467
and, you know,
I wish I had that bond,

912
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:50,233
so it's nice to have
a friend like this.

913
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:51,433
- It'll happen one day.

914
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,166
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?

915
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,133
- Probably not.

916
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,100
And that's okay.

917
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,133
[crying] I'm fine with that.

918
00:33:56,133 --> 00:34:00,200
I just--I hope he values...

919
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,467
like, who I am.

920
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:02,934
If I can get anything from this,

921
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:07,533
I'm just--I'm happy he was here
to see that I'm a good person.

922
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:10,367
That feels so good.

923
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,333
Thank you.

924
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,200
- Thanks, kids.
- Thank you.

925
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,400
- Next up, Latrice Royale
and Sharelle Royale.

926
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
That's Leland.

927
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,900
Girl, you come a long way.

928
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,200
- Sharelle is a ho.

929
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,900
She can't even get enough
of herself in the mirror.

930
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,400
- Really?
- Trust.

931
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,367
Look at that.

932
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,133
Do you see this?
- Yes.

933
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,500
- That's gorgeousness.
Gorgeousness.

934
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,667
- The family resemblance,
though,

935
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,066
it ain't up in there.

936
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,767
- You don't see none?
- Well, I...[mumbling]

937
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:39,800
- I'm different.

938
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,066
- Okay.

939
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,166
- See? There it is.

940
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,667
Now what? See.

941
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,800
- I will follow suit and say

942
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,633
that I'm not seeing
the family resemblance.

943
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:47,900
It's sort of more of like

944
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,200
here's two friends
in a Tyler Perry movie.

945
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,066
[laughter]

946
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:57,300
- Next up, Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.

947
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,667
That's Rick.

948
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,734
- Wow.

949
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,800
- And this
is Lil' Mama Michaels.

950
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,967
- Rick, I feel like you and I
could be related.

951
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:07,700
I feel like we look a little bit
alike if I straighten my hair.

952
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,066
And I'm digging it.

953
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,233
- I don't love the dresses
that I'm seeing here.

954
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,333
I think they could have used
a little more flash,

955
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,066
so I would have liked to see
a little more sparkle.

956
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,066
- Lil' Mama, was this
an unwanted pregnancy?

957
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,200
- Uh, yeah.

958
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,300
- 'Cause it was the most
somber, macabre,

959
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,934
fricking death walk
I've ever seen.

960
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,967
I was like, oh.

961
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,300
This poor baby.

962
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,734
- [laughs]

963
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,066
- I'm ready to have this baby.

964
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,367
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

965
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,066
I have, like,
four underwears right now

966
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,734
and, like, two pantyhose.

967
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,300
Even these shoes,
they don't even fit me.

968
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,867
They're glued to my feet
right now.

969
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,333
- Literally glued to your feet?

970
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,400
- They're glued to my feet,
so I can't take it off--

971
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
[laughter]

972
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,767
- He can't even kick 'em off.

973
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,700
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

974
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,333
Now while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,

975
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,266
the judges and I
will deliberate.

976
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,667
All right, kids.

977
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,567
Just between us "goils"...

978
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:02,633
let's start with Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.

979
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:04,433
- I loved the striptease.

980
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:05,533
I loved the walk.

981
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,233
- The runway presentation
was very basic.

982
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,400
Nothing sexy about it at all.

983
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,667
Because Chad doesn't take risks,

984
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,767
it brings Chad down.

985
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,300
- Well, I was enamored with him.

986
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,667
I thought she did a remarkable
job with Lady Samantha.

987
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,867
- Sharon Needles
with Robin Mansions.

988
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:24,533
- I love Sharon Needles.

989
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:25,500
I love her energy,

990
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,266
I love her humor,
I love her look.

991
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,934
However, I really thought
Robin Mansions

992
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,266
was a dog of a lady on stage.

993
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:35,333
- I just feel like she
left her sister out to hang.

994
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:38,567
- Phi Phi O'Hara
and her sister Gi Gi.

995
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:41,166
- Phi Phi is
absolutely adorable.

996
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,734
- I-I heart Phi Phi O'Hara.

997
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,333
Love the shoes, love the bag,
love everything.

998
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,367
Love it.

999
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,500
- There was really
an uncanny resemblance.

1000
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,533
- Yeah.

1001
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,800
- Latrice Royale and Sharelle.

1002
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
- Oh, the Royale sisters.

1003
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,734
- [giggles]

1004
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,667
- We're sisters,
but we look nothing alike.

1005
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,767
I just felt like they had
a different baby daddy.

1006
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,166
- I wasn't a huge fan
of the striptease.

1007
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,333
For me, a little lackluster.

1008
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:08,066
- Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.

1009
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:11,300
- I thought little Eva Longoria
was just adorable.

1010
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,667
So much charisma,

1011
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,500
and I can totally see why
you'd want to bring her back.

1012
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,433
- Their pregnancy dresses with
the fur coming out of the top,

1013
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:20,467
the sweater set,
and the marabou trim,

1014
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,133
it was all a little bit wrong.

1015
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:23,934
- Kenya Michaels
is a fierce queen.

1016
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,200
It's unfortunate that she's
just off her game.

1017
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,900
- Silence.

1018
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,600
Now bring back my girls.

1019
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:35,767
Welcome back, ladies.

1020
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,533
I've made some decisions.

1021
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:39,533
Chad Michaels...

1022
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:44,834
You're safe.

1023
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,767
- Thank you, Ru.
- Awesome.

1024
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,066
- Phi Phi O'Hara,

1025
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:53,333
you babied your daddy mama

1026
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,300
and carried this challenge
to full term.

1027
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,467
- Damn straight.

1028
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:00,667
- Condragulations.

1029
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,767
You are the winner
of this challenge.

1030
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,533
[applause]

1031
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,934
- Whoo! Yeah, girls!

1032
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:09,433
Whoo! Yeah!

1033
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,133
- You and your daddy mama

1034
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:14,467
have each won a trip for two
to Las Vegas,

1035

courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel.

1036
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,400
- Ha-ha-ha!

1037
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas,
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

1038
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,834
- Thank you. Mwah.

1039
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,133
- And all of our daddy mamas

1040
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:27,700
will receive a $1,000
gift certificate

1041
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,734
from Moods of Norway.

1042
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,567
Kenya Michaels,

1043
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:36,400
your daddy mama presentation

1044
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,834
gave us a case
of the baby blues.

1045
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1046
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,433
- Ooh.

1047
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,667
-<i> Oh, not again.</i>

1048
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:53,467
I don't want to do Carmen.
I don't want to go home today.

1049
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,700
- Sharon Needles...

1050
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,233
- You got this.

1051
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:03,767
- You gave your daddy mama
a face only a mother could love.

1052
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:06,667
Latrice Royale,

1053
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:11,900
your daddy mama looked like
a sister from another mister.

1054
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,066
Sharon Needles...

1055
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,800
you're safe.

1056
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,133
- Yes! Yes!

1057
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:27,433
Yes!

1058
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,066
- Latrice Royale,
I'm sorry, my dear,

1059
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:34,333
but you are up for elimination.

1060
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,633
- That's all right, mama.

1061
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,934
-<i> I didn't expect</i>
<i>to be in the bottom two,</i>

1062
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:39,400
<i>but I'm gonna turn it out.</i>

1063
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,934
It's do or die.

1064
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,533
- Two queens stand before me.

1065
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:46,700
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me...

1066
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:51,066
And save yourself
from elimination.

1067
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:58,600
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.

1068
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:05,000
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

1069
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,834
âª âª

1070
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:09,967
- âª Looking out âª

1071
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:13,166
âª On the morning rain âª

1072
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,166
- âª Ooh-ooh âª

1073
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,333
âª I used to feel âª

1074
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,767
âª So uninspired âª

1075
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,567
âª âª

1076
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:23,934
âª Before the day I met you âª

1077
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:26,734
âª Life was so unkind âª

1078
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:27,867
âª You're the key âª

1079
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:31,133
âª To my peace of mind âª

1080
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:34,333
âª 'Cause you make me feel âª

1081
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,800
âª You make me feel âª

1082
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,867
âª You make me feel âª

1083
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:44,100
âª Like a natural woman âª

1084
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,533
- âª Woman âª

1085
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:48,667
- âª When my soul âª

1086
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,834
âª Was in the lost and found âª

1087
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:55,100
âª You came along âª

1088
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,834
âª To claim it âª

1089
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,467
âª Now I'm no longer doubtful âª

1090
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,567
âª Of what I'm living for âª

1091
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,900
âª And if I make you happy âª

1092
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,066
âª I don't need to do more âª

1093
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,567
âª 'Cause you make me feel âª

1094
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:16,333
âª You make me feel âª

1095
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,233
âª You make me feel âª

1096
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:23,100
âª Like a natural woman âª

1097
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,133
âª You make me feel âª

1098
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,900
âª You make me feel âª

1099
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,166
âª You make me feel âª

1100
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:35,300
âª Like a natural woman âª

1101
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
- âª Woman âª

1102
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,734
- âª You make me feel âª

1103
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:40,066
[applause]

1104
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:41,400
[cheers]

1105
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:48,066
- Ladies,
I have made my decision.

1106
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:52,367
Latrice Royale...

1107
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:56,266
Shantay, you stay.

1108
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,133
- Thank you.

1109
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,266
- Lil' Kenya Michaels,

1110
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:03,066
it's hard to say good-bye
to a queen like you.

1111
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,367
Till we meet again.

1112
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:07,500
Now, sashay away.

1113
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,100
[laughter]

1114
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,266
- I feel sad because
all the girls have the dream

1115
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,533
to win this competition,

1116
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,967
and maybe it's not my time.

1117
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,433
Don't stop dreaming
'cause all the dreams come true.

1118
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,066
- Wow.

1119
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,133
The fantastic four.

1120
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:35,367
The future of drag
rests in your hands.

1121
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:38,633
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1122
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:40,567
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1123
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,266
Can I get an amen up in here?

1124
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:43,934
- all: Amen.
- All right.

1125
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:45,667
Now let the music play.

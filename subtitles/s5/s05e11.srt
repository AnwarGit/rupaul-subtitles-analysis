of yet, but I see it in my head.

inspiration in it.

been met.

325
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,467

- Now, how's your body-ody-ody
gonna play into this outfit?

344
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,834
- Well, it's a corset,

345
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,333
so I kind of brought it up
over here

346
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,967

00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,066
- Uh-huh.

349
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,066
Well, just, you know, make sure
it flatters your figure

350

serve true Roxxxy Andrews.

- Yeah.

00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,066
Ru's looking at me funny,

354
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,333
and I'm not sure that he likes
what I'm doing.

355
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,200
- Yeah, yeah. Wow.

356
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,967
- Now what am I gonna do?

357
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:45,066
- You better bring some hard
Roxxxy candy on the runway.

358

Get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.

He's a master at what he does.

- Right.

In addition to creating your

Now, Alaska, as the winner
of the mini challenge,

377
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,667
you're in charge
of the choreography.

378
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,834

Get your bowleg on.

about this much rhythm.

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,066
So this is gonna be
a hot fucking shitty mess.

383
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:55,967
- I expect to see sugar and
spice and everything nice,

384
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,934
so don't fuck it up.

385

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,066
I look over, and Roxxxy's look
is completely gone.

389
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,433
- Ru said something
about my silhouette, so--

390
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,133
at this point in the game,

391
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,433
if she's saying something,
it's for a reason.

392
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,834
- Right.

393
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,400

back at square one.

394
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,166
I'm going with this licorice.

395
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
It looks like spaghetti.

396
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,567
This licorice is so thin.

397
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,333
But I'm putting on there
one at a time.

398
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,467
It's so tedious.

00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:29,467

00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,133
I'm working this lollipop,
sexy sweet 16.

693
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,400
- Rizzo's P.G.

694
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,600
- Pass it on.

695
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,266
- [laughs]

696
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:24,600
- Category is Sugar Mama,
executive realness.

697
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,567
Alaska.

698
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,600
- Cougar lady.
- Yes.

699
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
She's serving Barbara Corcoran.

700
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,333
[laughter]

701
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,100
- This woman takes her job
very seriously.

702
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,633
She's coming to visit
the construction site,

703
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:39,633
and, by god, there better not be
any bullshit.

704
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,567
- Tear down that bitch of
a bearing wall.

705
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,233
[laughter]

706
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:45,934
Jinkx Monsoon.

707
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,333
Darling, it's Lacroix, darling.

708
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,433
It's Lacroix.

709
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,133
[laughter]

710
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,066
- I am just camping it
down the runway

711
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:56,834
with every utensil I could find
stuck in my little French twist.

712
00:27:56,834 --> 00:28:00,533
- She does give good
headmistress.

713
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,433
Roxxxy Andrews.

714
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:05,066
- Pork bellies?
Sell! Buy! No!

715
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,166
- Tina Knowles, I'm not buying
your line.

716
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,066
- Yes.
[laughter]

717
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:12,633
- I'm in my little short velvet
dress with my gummy bears,

718
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:15,467
and I am feeling sickening.

719
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:18,266
C-E-oh-no-she-didn't.

720
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,633
- Up next, Detox.

721
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,600
Serving Mugler.
- Oh, yeah.

722
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,066
- No lady is ever sure
at night.

723
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:26,433
- That's right.

724
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,967
- I've Angel perfume and
my Thierry Mugler bag.

725
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,400
Take that and suck on it.

726
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,633
- Love that blazer.

727
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,233
It's a real power top.

728
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,633
- [cackles]
Kind of like me!

729
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,300
- [laughs]

730
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,166
Category is Candy Couture,
edible eleganza.

731
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,433
First up, Alaska.

732
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,433
I think the material is
a cotton candy blend.

733
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,066
- I was having
some serious issues

734
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,800
with this cotton candy
fantasy.

735
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,166
So I'm feeling beautiful and
right,

736
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,333
but please, candy couture,
don't fall apart.

737
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,633
- Fluff the magic drag queen.

738
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,066
- Mmm.

739
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,633
- Jinkx Monsoon.

740
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,567
It's a hard candy Christmas.

741
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,433
- And her breath
is minty fresh.

742
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:11,233
I decided not to wear
that damn hoop skirt,

743
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,667
and I couldn't be more pleased
with the way it turned out.

744
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:16,667
I am the Abominable Snow Jinkx.

745
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,967
- Peppermint patty realness.

746
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,934
- This is a stag party.

747
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,500
[laughter]

748
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,934
- Roxxxy Andrews.

749
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,600
- Ooh.
- Wow, taste the rainbow.

750
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,133
- Bitches.

751
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,934
- Those judges cannot take this
coutureness.

752
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,233
Miss Thing, I know
my body looks right.

753
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,900
This licorice is exactly where
I need to be laying.

754
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,233
- Melts in your mouth.

755
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,467
- I wonder if her panties are
edible too.

756
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,066
- They are.

757
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,133
- Detox.

758
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,567
Very Splenda in the grass.

759
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,166
- My candy couture look,
it's Detox.

760
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,533
It's electric.

761
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,266
It still has a little touch
of the '80s.

762
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,233
- Lollipopulence.
- Yes.

763
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:54,200
- Is that some black licorice
I see?

764
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,333
- Uh-huh.
Licorice and lace.

765
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,500
Coming up...

766
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,433
Which one of you sweethearts

767
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,400
does not deserve to be
in the top three?

768
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,633
[dramatic music]

769
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,667
- [laughing]

770
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,800
Welcome, ladies.

771
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,500
Thanks to your candy couture,
I've got a cavity.

772
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,300
And it's throbbing.

773
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,900
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

774
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,934
First up, Alaska.
- Hi.

775
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:28,333
- Alaska, so<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was</i>
really cute.

776
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,633
I thought that it was
a little simple.

777
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:34,400
But your sweet 16, perfection.

778
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,166
- I see these girls all over
my part of Los Angeles. [laughs]

779
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,900
And I love how you committed
to the character.

780
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,266
- The cougar lady,
perfect in every way.

781
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:45,300
And the cotton candy is, to me,

782
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,834
the best representation of
candy.

783
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,600
I knew exactly what you were
when you walked out.

784
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,266
That's important.

785
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:55,467
- All right, next up
Jinkx Monsoon.

786
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,500
- The<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> number,</i>
you really stood out,

787
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,633
'cause I did like your
googly-eye bit.

788
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,934
- Your sweet 16 party girl,

789
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:04,900
16 going on 47.

790
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Like, she didn't feel young
at all.

791
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,400
- When I walked
into the werk room,

792
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,900
you had a big hoop skirt
that you had doctored and--

793
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,967
- Oh, yes.

794
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,233
I think it was a good choice

795
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:16,734
not to try to do too much
in one look.

796
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:18,467
- Jinkx, you break my heart.

797
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,400
I really want to see candy

798
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,834
glued to every piece of fabric
that you have on.

799
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,266
A hoop skirt
would have allowed you

800
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:28,600
to glue more candy onto
your outfit.

801
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,166
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

802
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,834
- Your sweet 16 party girl,

803
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,133
I love that you did the edible
marshmallow jewelry,

804
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:39,600
although she was a really
promiscuous-looking 16-year-old.

805
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,367
- The executive look, I love.

806
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,066
You just looked like a bitch
on wheels.

807
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,433
I loved it.

808
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:47,233
- You reminded me of
<i>The Devil Wears Prada.</i>

809
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,433
And I love the candy couture
outfit.

810
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:52,066
You should make it for yourself
out of real fabric,

811
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:53,367
because you look great in it.

812
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,633
It's so flattering.

813
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,900
- Up next, Detox.

814
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,667
- I liked your sweet 16
'80s look--

815
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,600
your attitude, the jacket.

816
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,100
And the sugar mama executive

817
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,633
reminded me of, like,
Glenn Close in<i> Fatal Attraction.</i>

818
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,066
- Your candy couture, though...

819
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,533
girl, it's a stretch.

820
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:13,266
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect

821
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,567
between buying something
off the rack

822
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,066
versus designing something for
yourself.

823
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,200
And it makes me question
your taste level.

824
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,533
- All right.
Thank you, Detox.

825
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:25,867
Ladies, I hate to end
on a sour patch,

826
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:30,333
but I have one
final question.

827
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,200
Which one of you sweethearts

828
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,967
does not deserve to be
in the top three and why?

829
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:39,533
Starting with Jinkx.

830
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:45,600
- The one who has fallen short
most often up here is Detox.

831
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,333
- Alaska, same question.

832
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,367
- I would say Jinkx Monsoon.

833
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,867
I absolutely love her, but

834
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:58,333
I feel like there's maturing
that I would like to see.

835
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,934
- Roxxxy Andrews?
- Jinkx Monsoon.

836
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:03,900
The challenges that she needed
to step outside of her box

837
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,867
and design and be creative,
she didn't do well.

838
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:08,500
I had to be funny where I had
to be funny.

839
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,600
And it when it landed me
in the bottom,

840
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,133
it landed me in the bottom.

841
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,400
- Detox?

842
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,433
- I do agree
with the other girls.

843
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,166
It's not really a school
for girls.

844
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,133
It's a competition for the best
of the best.

845
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,467
- All right.
Thank you, ladies.

846
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,266
I think we've heard enough.

847
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,467
Now, while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,

848
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,266
the judges and I
will deliberate.

849
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,066
[engine starts]
All right.

850
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:33,066
Just between us "goils,"
what do you think?

851
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:35,433
Let's start with Alaska.

852
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:39,266
- Alaska really brought three
fully realized looks.

853
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:42,066
I liked her sweet 16 number.

854
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:44,300
- The only thing is, I would've
maybe have liked to have seen,

855
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,500
like, a light color dress.

856
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,133
Like, why black?

857
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:48,900
- It's the days of wearing
a lot of fluffy pink

858
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,166
doesn't exist anymore.

859
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,567
You know, they want to look like
a whore.

860
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,934
[laughter]
- What's wrong with that, Bob?

861
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:55,333
[laughter]

862
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,900
- The executive sugar mama,

863
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,133
she committed to who she was
bossing around.

864
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,467
I loved it.

865
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:04,133
- It could go really bad
for a man in drag

866
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,600
wearing a blazer
and a pair of slacks.

867
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,100
But the way she cut it in
at the waist,

868
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,567
the way she padded herself,
I bought it.

869
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,433
- I thought the candy costume

870
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,567
was the only one that really
said candy when she walked out.

871
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,934
And I think she knows how to use
those legs.

872
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,567
- She's bowlegged.

she's a star.

877

from her.

880
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,633
- The executive look,
what I liked most

881
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,233
about it was the crazy-ass hair

882
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:44,166
juxtaposed with that, like,
very sleek suit.

883
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:48,367
- She was very prepared with
the fashion that she brought.

884
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:52,200
But then when she is asked to do
something from scratch, like,

885
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,433
the taste level, like,
disappears.

886
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,467
- If they're gonna design
their own dress,

887
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,433
they have to know
how to work that dress.

888
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,100
She didn't work it at all.

889
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,066
She never did anything
except just stumble over it

890
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,066
and trip all over it.

891
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,433
- Roxxxy Andrews.

892
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:08,400
- Roxxxy was the only one
who brought candy

893
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,600
to each and every one
of her looks.

894
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,533
- The sugar mama executive,
I loved her attitude.

895
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:16,133
There was something--I kind of
liked that it was a short dress,

896
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,900
and she's kind of got, you know,
muscular thighs.

897
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,166
- Her candy couture was my
favorite of the night.

898
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,333
- But we didn't know
that was candy.

899
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,867
- But she worked it.

900
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,467
- When I was backstage
with her,

901
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:29,166
she had something completely
different,

902
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,200
something that looked like
a candy-coated Dorito.

903
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,667
- [laughs]

904
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,066
That sounds good.

905
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,500
- Yeah, it sounds delicious.

906
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,400
But I questioned it, and she
changed it, you know?

907
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,066
And that's the sign of someone
who is paying attention.

908
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:44,333
All right,
moving on to Jinkx Monsoon.

909
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,133
- I think she's a terrific
performer.

910
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,266
But as far as the candy couture
outfit goes,

911
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,066
it just didn't really work.

912
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:54,200
- If you can't tell that your
'70s-inspired look

913
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,400
isn't really doing
the sweet 16 thing,

914
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,767
I don't know when you're gonna
know that.

915
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:02,066

in<i> Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte.</i>

that she was getting thrown
under the bus by Rolodex here.

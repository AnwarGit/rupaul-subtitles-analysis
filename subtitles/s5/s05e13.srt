00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:08,333
- Tonight on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown ...</i>

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,300
We're just one week away from

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,567
crowning America's
Next Drag Superstar.

4
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,700
Are you team Alaska, team Jinkx,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,166
or team Roxxxy?

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,967
To help you decide, we have a

7
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:22,667
play-by-play analysis
of a season full of shock...

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,266
and shade.

9
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,200
- Look how orange you fucking
look, girl.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
[alarm blaring]

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,233
-<i> Orange alert!</i>

12
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,233
<i>Fashion dos...</i>

13
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,433
-<i> Whoo!</i>

14
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,967
-<i> And "Oh, no,</i>
<i>she better don'ts."</i>

15
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,166
- I will not wear
another caftan.

16
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,934
- In never-before-seen moments,

17
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,233
celebrity guest stars exposed.

18
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,000
[all imitating monkeys]

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,367
Queens bare all.

20
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,734
- Whoa!

21
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,533
- These girls are cock-hungry
dick pigs.

22
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,767
- And later, find out what

23
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:52,233
stars are saying
about your drag idols.

24
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:55,367
And then, for the first time
anywhere,

25
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:59,066
we reveal<i> Untucked:</i>
<i>The Lost Episode.</i>

26
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:02,200
- What I have,
you guys don't have.

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,066
- To help break this shit down,

28
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,633
we'll be joined
by countdown correspondents,

29
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,734
Latrice Royale, Willam,
Sharon Needles,

30
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:13,600
and a world exclusive Ru-on-Ru
interview.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,166
Just how damn old are you?

32
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,066
Oh, it's gonna be like that,
huh?

33
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,633
Are those your real teeth?

34
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:23,066
All this, plus the music video
world premiere of<i> The Beginning.</i>

35
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,400
<i>From the thrill of victory...</i>

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
- Yes.

37
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,433
-<i> To the agony of defeat...</i>

38
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,533
- Oh!

39
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,567
- Let the<i> Countdown to the Crown</i>
begin!

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,200
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,800
receives a sickening supply of

[tires screeching]

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,266
- Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown.</i>

47
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:02,100
Alaska, Jinkx Monsoon,
Roxxxy Andrews.

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,066
With one week remaining, this
season

49
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:08,200
is the closest contest
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,233
Even I can't quite put my finger

51
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,200
on the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
it will take to win the title

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,734
of America's
Next Drag Superstar.

54
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,934
That's why I want to hear
from you.

55
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,633
Which queen deserves to win,
and why?

58
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,266
And sound off via Facebook,

59
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,333
Instagram, Tumblr,
and Pinterest.

60
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,767
To win the crown,
your favorite queen

61
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,967
needs all the help you can give,

62
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,900
tonight and all week long.

63
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,233
Now speaking of favorites,

64
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,066
I want to check in with
my countdown correspondents,

65
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:55,567
Latrice Royale, Willam,
and Sharon Needles.

66
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,500
Welcome, ladies.

67
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,367
- Hi-yee!
- Hey, Ru.

68
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,667
- Can you help me make sense
of this crazy season?

69
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:06,300
- Ru, the suspense is killing
me, and not in a good way.

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,600
My marriage is at stake.

71
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,867
- Boo-hoo. I'm mad.

72
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:11,900
Season five was all about
performing,

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,333
and I could have tore it up,
like an episiotomy.

74
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,800
- Ooh, Ru, I'm living
for these season five girls.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,166
Honey, you've got some funny
characters on this season.

76
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,266
Bitch, I live!

77
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,600
- Well, thank you, ladies.

78
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,867
I'll be checking back with you
in just a minute.

79
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:31,533
Now, to truly understand
how Alaska, Jinkx, and Roxxxy

80
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,834
ascended to the top three,

81
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,467
we need to do an instant RuPlay

82
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:40,500
of the bad-ass bitches they beat
down in their battle to become

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,834
America's Next Drag Superstar.

84
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,667
Game on.

85
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,900
- Hello, boys.

86
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,867
- Week one, Cincinnati cougar

87
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,633
Penny Tration hit the field
with a seasoned swagger.

88
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,233
Thousands of fans voted to get
her here,

89
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,800
but it took just one devastating
block by rookie

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,867
Serena Chacha to send
her packing.

91
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,433
all: Hi!

92
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:07,066
- College draft pick Serena
Chacha arrived a young pup,

93
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,166
eager to run with the big dogs.

94
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,266
- I have a feeling you just
like to be the only pretty one.

95
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,700
- I just think you're annoying.

96
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,100
- But on her second outing,

97
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,467
a flag on the play...

98
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,834
- Doo-de-doo-de-doo.

99
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,100
- Signaled that Serena was a
little out of her league,

100
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,834
and she cha-cha'd her way out
of the game.

101
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,533
- To the other queens,
pick up a book and go read.

102
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,834
- Hello, girls.

103
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,734
- Big-hearted Banji girl
Monica Beverly Hillz...

104
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:33,934
- With a "Z."

105
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,867
- Was a prospect with promise.

106
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:40,066
- Monica Beverly Hillz
is very good at giving face.

107
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,066
- While she didn't always bring
her "A" game...

108
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,433
- Can't you see I'm trying to
get some sunlight--

109
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,200
[stammers]
-<i> Cut!</i>

110
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,233
She bravely shared her "T"
with the rest of the world.

111
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,166
And when she lip-synched
for her life against Coco,

112
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,400
Monica Beverly Hillz
was sent back to

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,500
the 9-0-2-1-oh, no,
she better don't.

114
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,567
- Hey, sisters.

115
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,333
- San Francisco treat
Honey Mahogany

116
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,100
brought her own mystique
to the challenges.

117
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,133
- Bitch, I am from Chicago!

118
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,633
- But in her dance debut,
her kicks were incomplete.

119
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,266
- You know, I've never done
Diana before.

120
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,867
- Clearly.

121
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,266
- Hey, y'all.

122
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:23,166
- Week after week, catch
of the day Vivienne Pinay

123
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,500
felt stiff-armed
by the competition.

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,066
- Great.
A bunch of loudmouths.

125
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,967
- But her dance in the end zone

126
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,800
failed to put her
on the scoreboard.

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,166
A lackluster lip sync came down
to a coin toss,

128
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,500
and both Honey and Vivienne
hit the showers

129
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,133
in<i> Drag Race's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first</i>
double elimination.

130
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,834
- Oh!
- Oh, word!

131
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,400
- Now, if pretty scored you
extra points,

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,533
Lineysha Sparx would have been
an all-star.

133
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:54,767
Her Tyra-nese performance got
her named MVP.

134
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:58,700
But sadly, Lineysha's snatch
game was over before it began...

135
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,200
- French fries.

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,300
- Leaving Detox to bench
this beauty for good.

137
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,200
- Hey, girls, hey!

138
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,533
- Jade Jolie arrived all

139
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,433
sparkles, rainbows,
and sunshine.

140
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,600
Her laugh was her best defense.

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
- [laughing]

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
- But still this queen could

143
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,133
dominate the offense whenever
shade was in play.

144
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,900
- Some people shouldn't come
down and wear a two-piece

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,166
because the view
that I had was not too cute.

146
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,467
- But instead of finding
her voice...

147
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,467
- ♪<i> Can I get an amen?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ♪</i>

148
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,934
- She found herself lip-synching
against Coco,

149
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:35,066
and in the end, sashayed away.

150
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,066
- Uh-oh.

151
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,500
- Hey, ladies! Aah!

152
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,734
- Oh!

153
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:42,400
- Ivy Winters turned out to be
a triple threat.

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,934
She could sew, she could sing,

155
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,066
and she gave great face.

156
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,333
Although sometimes it seemed her

157
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,967
presentation
was a little stilted.

158
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,166
Wah!

159
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,066
Sadly, a fumble in the fragrance
challenge...

160
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,367
- New York City.

161
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,200
- Uh, that's Tokyo.

162
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,300
- Kept this queen from making
the final playoffs.

163
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:05,600
Texas Tornado Alyssa Edwards
hit the field,

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,066
ready to play hard
and settle old scores.

165
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,467
- Game on, bitch.
The sequel.

166
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:14,667
- She gave game face
for the ages.

167
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,867
- [smacks lips]

168
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,934
- And her countless
Alyssa-isms...

169
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,066
- I don't get cute.

170
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,600
I get drop-dead gorgeous.

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,867
- Gave inspiration...

172
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,066
-<i> Back rolls!</i>

173
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,066
- To the nation.

174
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:28,433
-<i> Why you being cute?</i>

175
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,967
- On the main stage,

176
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,066
this dancing diva
had all the right moves.

177
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,834
But by the telenovella...

178
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:38,300
- I have the same disease!

179
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,767
- Her pageant prance
was played out.

180
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:41,934
- What?

181
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:45,433
- And she was sent home
by her archrival...

182
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,200
Coco Montrese.

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,300
- The diva has arrived!

184
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,600
- A Vegas veteran who was
always ready to rumble...

185
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,734
- Don't try it, little boy.

186
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,734
- Or lip-synch the house down.

187
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,900
Ever the underdog, Coco scored
a big win at the roast...

188
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,367
- Pants so high, he look like

189
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:06,066
he in New Orleans at
Hurricane Katrina, girl.

190
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,700
[laughter]

191
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,867
- But dropped the ball
in the army-navy makeover,

192
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,333
forcing this beauty queen
to take her final bow.

193
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,967
Feeling overwhelmed?

194
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,433
You need to Detox.

195
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,367
This silicone cyclone put in

196
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,467
major work before suiting up
for<i> Drag Race.</i>

197
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,967
- I've had my hips
and my ass done.

198
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,100
I've had my pecs done.

199
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,333
Underneath my eyes done.

200
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,633
My six-pack done.

201
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,266
- And once here,
she had a few surprises

202
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,300
to pull out of her b-b-b-box!

203
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,800
- [clucking] Hi, kids!

204
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,533
- A runway rock star, Detox
never let us see her sweat...

205
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,233
all: Oh!

206
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:47,767
- Prompting some to accuse her
of coasting toward the end zone.

207
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,333
Ultimately this final four
standout

208
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,533
hit a sugar wall
in the sugar ball.

209
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,166
And after losing her lip sync
to Jinkx,

210
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,900
parting was bittersweet.

211
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,200
- I've had it. Bye.

212
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,166
- Well, there you have it,
skorts fans.

213
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,166
This season's rocky road
to the top three.

214
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,200
Damn!

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,367
I need a protein shake.

216
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,367
Coming up...

217
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,233
- The shade of it all.

218
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:14,633
-<i> With Latrice, Willam,</i>
<i>and Sharon Needles.</i>

219
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:18,567
<i>Plus never-before-seen</i>
<i>too-hot-for-Drag-Race outtakes.</i>

220
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,467
- Come here and sit on my face,

221
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,367
- And for the first time
anywhere,

222
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,767
we reveal<i> Untucked:</i>
<i>The Lost Episode.</i>

223
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,834
- No one's hiding any knives or
shivs on their dresses,

224
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,867
are they?

225
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,066
- Keep tweeting who you want to

226
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:34,066
be crowned America's Next
Drag Superstar,

227
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:37,967
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Countdown</i>
<i>to the Crown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>

228
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,567
[laughing]

229
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,100
[laughing]

230
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,633
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race: Countdown to the Crown.</i>

231
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,266
This has been the stormiest
season on record.

232
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,266
- I could give a fuck.

233
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:55,567
- One thing's for sure,

234
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:59,500
the forecast always included
a 100% chance of...

235
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,734
- Shade.

236
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,700
- Early in the season,

237
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,900
super storm Coco collided
with hurricane Alyssa

238
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,133
and let us have it.

239
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,266
- I don't think she wants
to talk about it.

240
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,967
But we're gonna talk about it...

241
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,233
if she doesn't go home first.

242
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,900
- Shade.

243
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,200
- Just pearls hanging off
her boobs, baby.

244
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,867
- Very you.

245
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,233
- Shade.

246
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,100
She's won several pageants,

247
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,867
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.

248
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,066
- Shade.

249
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,333
And then the tears come out.

250
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,633
And the Academy Award goes to...

251
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,066
- Shade.

252
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,233
You need to be worried about
what's going over there with

253
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,700
that same makeup
every single time.

254
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,300
- Look how orange you
fucking look, girl!

255
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,500
- Girls, you're both pretty.

256
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,200
both: Shade.

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,934
- Now is it just me, or are you
over this pageant feud mess?

258
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,767
Officially.

259
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,266
Ain't nobody got time for that.

260
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,633
Now I got some extra yummy,

261
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,967
never-before-seen leftovers
from the RuPaul roast.

262
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,467
- Michelle, your nails are
so long,

263
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,834
how the fuck do you wipe
your ass?

264
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,266
- Oh-ho!

265
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,266
- But better yet, how do you
wipe Ru's before you kiss it?

266
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:13,100
[laughter]

267
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,066
- Let me tell y'all about
Santino.

268
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,166
All the hems on his clothes
be crooked.

269
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,467
You know why?

270
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,433
'Cause he's always looking
at you like this.

271
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,300
[laughter]

272
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,266
- Knock, knock.

273
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,300
all: Who's there?

274
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,533
- Ivy Winters.

275
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,567
all: Ivy Winters who?

276
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,867
- Exactly.

277
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:29,066
[laughter]

278
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:31,800
- RuPaul, you don't need
a roast, mama.

279
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,967
By the looks of your face,

280
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,400
it's been roasting
for quite some time.

281
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,900
[laughter]

282
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,200
- Ru, you're always saying,

283
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,533
"You're born naked,
and the rest is drag."

284
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,100
but in your case,
you were born naked,

285
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,133
and the rest was just fucking
terrible.

286
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,300
[laughter]

287
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,600
- Now, joining us live from
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Weather Center,</i>

288
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,266
mother meteorologist
Latrice Royale.

289
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,400
Hi.

290
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,100
- Hi. I got news for you.

291
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,600
- Ooh, child.

292
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,967
Now what do you think of all the
romper room fuckery this season?

293
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,767
- Ru, I have one thing to say.

294
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,400
The shade.

295
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
The shade of it all.

296
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,133
- [laughs]

297
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,066
Now, Latrice, does the
competition bring out the worst

298
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,900
in some queens?

299
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,233
Or are they just shady ladies?

300
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:20,300
- RuPaul, in my experience,
the camera don't lie,

301
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,633
and neither do I.

302
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,266
Oh, and, girls, stop blaming
the editing, okay?

303
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,266
- Bible.

304
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,567
Bible, girl, uh-huh.

305
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,667
Tell it. Tell it!

306
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,800
- But you know what I love
about<i> Drag Race?</i>

307
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,934
Just when you think everything
has gone dark,

308
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:40,900
out comes a rainbow
of truth and light!

309
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,934
Hallelujah.

310
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:42,934
- Yes, ma'am.

311
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,100
- Let's take a look at some of

312
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,900
the most heartwarming moments
this season.

313
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
- Hey, Alyssa, this is Dad.

314
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,266
- Oh!
- I just want you to know...

315
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,734
- [cries]

316
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,934
- [cries] I'm proud of you.

317
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:00,433
And now I'm not ashamed
to tell people my son's gay.

318
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,367
- Oh! Oh, my God.

319
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,100
[crying]

320
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,533
- Forgiveness is free, baby.

321
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,066
Give all you can.

322
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,900
- I've just been holding
a secret in,

323
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,133
and I've been trying so hard
and--

324
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,400
- What secret?

325
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,166
- I'm not just a drag queen.

326
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm a transgendered woman.

327
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,467
Every day is hard.

328
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,066
- I invited you here
because you were fierce.

329
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,400
The only person
who does not believe is you.

330
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,433
Stay strong,
Monica Beverly Hillz.

331
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,967
- I will.

332
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,400
- God makes no mistakes.

333
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,633
You be you, child.

334
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,133
- I continually regret and,

335
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:45,633
like, second-guess the fact that
I left my youngest brother

336
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:49,266
with a woman who wasn't ready
to be a mom.

337
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,200
When I'm, like, doing shit like
this, I feel so selfish...

338
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,467
- Don't, Jinkx, don't.

339
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,266
- [cries] To have left
my youngest brother.

340
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,667
- Don't.
Not at all.

341
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,100
- It feels like--right now,
like I've abandoned him.

342
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,133
- You haven't.

343
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,066
- Patience and love, honey.

344
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,800
Patience and love.

345
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,934
- My mother left my sister
and myself

346
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:09,333
at a bus stop
when I was three.

347
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,400
[cries] I try to stay so strong,

348
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
but I'm so weak
at the same time.

349
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,200
[crying]

350
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
It just hurts that I was left.

351
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,467
Nobody cared.

352
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,700
- You know, we as gay people,

353
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,066
we get to choose our family,
you know?

354
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:33,166
We get to choose the people
that we're around.

355
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,066
I am your family.

356
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:37,100
We are a family here.

357
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,667
- Bless us all.

358
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,300
Bless us all.

359
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,767
This is large and in charge,

360
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,433
chunky, yet funky,
Latrice Royale.

361
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,133
Back to you, Ru.

362
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,767
- Thank you, my queen.

363
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,767
- Aah!

364
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:49,934
[beep]

365
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,400
- Tonight, we're getting up
close and personal

366
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,300
with each
of our top three queens,

367
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,767
starting in alphabetical order
with the 49th state, Alaska.

368
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,934
Wiggling in from Pittsburgh,
Alaska arrived as a dark horse.

369
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,066
She auditioned for every season,

370
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:19,567
only to watch her girlfriend
snatch the crown last year.

371
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:25,233
But when this bowlegged beauty
arrived, she had me at "Hi-yee!"

372
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,667
- Hi-yee!
- Hi-yee!

373
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,166
- Hi-yee!
Hi-yee.

374
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,066
Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.

375
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,967
- She tanked her first challenge

376
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,367
and quickly joined forces
with Rolaskatox.

377
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,734
But after some tough love...

378
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:37,867
- No!

379
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,066
- Alaska declared a state
of independence.

380
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,867
- Alaska.

381
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,600
- Until last week, she was the
only queen never to lip-synch

382
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
for her life.

383
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
And, girl, when it comes
to making us laugh,

384
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,166
Alaska has always been
right on the money.

385
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,767
- [whispering]
Your makeup is terrible.

386
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,133
- From the fragrance challenge
to the sugar ball,

387
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,600
she delivered one
of the strongest finishes

388
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,400
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>

389
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,800
And her triumphant testimony
on the main stage last week

390
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,500
showed us why Alaska could be
America's Next Drag Superstar.

391
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,967
So if you believe in Alaska,
let me feel it.

392
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:19,133
Tweet us at @RuPaulsDragRace

Plus,<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Deep Dish with</i>
Willam and Sharon Needles.

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,467
- And I'm currently sitting on
my balls, like Mother Goose.

399
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,700
Honk!

400
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,900
- And a Ru-on-Ru
exclusive interview.

401
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,467
And later, we reveal
for the first time anywhere,

<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode...</i>

403
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,333
- You can be glamorous without,

404
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,500
like, 1,000 million stones
on your dress.

405
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,066
- Oh, Miss Thing.

406
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,667
- As<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>

407

410
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:11,834
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's Drag</i>

And because of you, our show

413
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,867
taking over Tumblr,

414
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,300
and winning America's

on RyanSeacrest.com.

That's RyanSeacrest.com.

417

Hi-yee!

418
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,900
When it comes to<i> Drag Race,</i>
celebrities are just like us.

419
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,400
When they see something they
love, they tweet all about it.

420
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,066
Rolaskatox had Adam Lambert
gagging.

421
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:45,066
The legendary Sally Jessy
Raphael lives for Jinkx Monsoon.

422
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,100
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're special.
Shout-out to you.

423
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,967
- And Nicki Minaj is in love
with my girls.

424
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,467
Her favorite new expression...

425
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,433
- All "T," all shade.

426
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,734
- And, Mariah,
what you got, girl?

427
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:01,567
Now this next queen is so viral,
she's sickening.

428
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,333
Hi, Willam.
- Thanks, Ru.

429
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,934
Hey, superfans, you tweeted us
questions, and I got answers.

430
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:08,500
[beeping]

431
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,266
@johnbrunskill--
that's a lot of name.

432
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,400
"If you had to pick,

433
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,166
which season five gal
would you kai kai with?"

434
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,133
Coco, she's black.

435
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,433
@mcbrewster,
"You're a friend of Detox."

436
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:27,900
@fozziebare, "Don't you agree
that we need #LessFishMoreFun?"

437
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,266
No.

438
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,266
If you want ugly,
turn on Discovery Network.

439
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,333
Good-bye.

440
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,066
@bck2mono--
Oh, I've had that too.

441
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,066
[chuckles]

442
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,433
"What was more shocking,

443
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:41,500
the Honey and Vivienne Pinay
double elimination or yours?"

444
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,100
Mine.

445
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,567
They didn't even throw up.

446
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,533
Fucking amateurs.

447
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,934
@RuPaul, "Love you baby,
but your time is up.

448
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:50,967
Thanks, gi--"

449
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,400
Oh, I gotta go.

450
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,734
- Thanks, Willam.

451
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,567
And for the record, opinions
expressed by Willam

452
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,734
do not reflect that
of RuPaul Inc.,

453
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,834
Logo TV, President Obama,

454
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,867
or Tuckahoe State Prison
for ladies.

455
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:04,867
- [hums]

456
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,166
- Now, our superfans don't just
watch the show,

457
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,500
they do recaps and become stars
in their own right.

458
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,767
I love them all.

459
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,433
But these are some
of my favorites.

460
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:22,300
Can I get a RuCap up in here?

461
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,133
- Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.

462
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,400
- That was best episode ever!

463
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,667
- Whoever is making up these
mini-challenges, bitch,

464
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,667
they need an Emmy.

465
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,900
Did you see--whew!

466
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,967
- My favorite walk
of this runway was Alyssa.

467
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,066
- [laughs]

468
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,967
both: Alyssa Edwards.

469
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,567
- She ain't gonna win.

470
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:44,300
- With that fucking
faux dog-rat thing.

471
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
- [laughs]

472
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,900
- That is if she don't go home
first.

473
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,433
- Like, I wanted, like,
5, 6, 7, 24, 52.

474
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:57,700
- Jade is a string of pearls
away from becoming a showgirl!

475
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,600
- I am serving you fish, honey.

476
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,633
Fish on a platter.

477
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,000
[laughs]

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,400
- It was the best mini-challenge
of any reality TV show,

479
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,333
past, present, and motherfucking
future, bitches.

480
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,200
- Some of the biggest
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>

481
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,734
are our extra special
guest judges.

482
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:23,233
Hold onto your wigs for
celebrity guest stars exposed.

483
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,367
- Do you tuck the balls, too,
or just--

484
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,533
- You gotta tuck them balls,
girl?

485
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,533
- Yes.

486
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,900
- How do you tuck the balls?
- Well--

487
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,333
- Actually, I give a detailed
description in my book,

488
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,166
<i>Workin' It!,</i>
which is available on Amazon.

489
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,300
- You can definitely tell
Alaska has two feet,

490
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,934
but we embrace the two feet,
and we're trying to help her--

491
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:40,767
- The left--
Everyone has two feet.

492
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:41,800
Two left feet.

493
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,033
- Sorry, two left feet.

494
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,433
- This one.

495
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:47,233
Sharp as a knife.

496
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,033
- Anita, I think Coco's
in trouble.

497
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,333
- I think so too.

498
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,467
[laughs] If she had done what
Santiago had suggested--

499
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,467
- Or Santino.
- Or Santino.

500
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,433
- Oh, Santino, I'm sorry!
- Or Santino!

501
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:02,767
- And from the Fashion Police,
George Kotsiopoulos.

502
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:06,500
What are you gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?

503
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,433
'Cause my pussy's on fire.

504
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,166
[both laugh]

505
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,066
- It's "bro-cod," black
and with this gold,

506
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,533
horrible "bro-cod,"
but it's, like--

507
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,633
- Are you trying to say brocade?

508
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,767
- No, I say "bro-cod."

509
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,066
- It's brocade.

510
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,600
- Uh, in France, it's "bro-cod."

511
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,934
- It's fucking brocade.

512
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,734
- I don't care where the fuck
you went to school--

513
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,667
- It's brocade.
- Swear to God.

514
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,266
- They so crazy!

515
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:33,500
But nobody get it twisted
like my girls.

516
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,533
I try to raise them right,
but what you gonna do?

517
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,500
- Whoa!

518
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,633
- [laughs]

519
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,433
- I won the challenge!

520
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:54,567
- Oh, my God.
Not by my bag!

521
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,100
Not by my bag, not by my bag!

522
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,767
- Aah!

523
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:01,333
- Some of these girls
are cock-hungry dick pigs.

524
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,533
- I want to see Lineysha naked.

525
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,900
- Trade! Trade!

526
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,767
Come here and sit on my face,
bitch!

527
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,066
- They said, "What do you like
the best about the werk room?"

528
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,333
I said, "There's a lot
of naked men."

529
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,333
- Trade!

530
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,166
- Would they have to blur this?

531
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,533
- I made this for you.

532
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,700
- [laughs] That's wonderful!

533
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,233
- Do you see
what's happening there?

534
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,567
- Gay sex in the service!

535
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:27,100
- It's time to play America's
new favorite game,

536
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,867
"Cut or Uncut."

537
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,600
[laughter]

538
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,567
Blue! Not a match.

539
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,633
- I sucked.

540
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,934
- Oh, not a match.

541
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:36,633
- Well, I didn't suck.

542
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:38,066
I wanted to, but--

543
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,300
Sorry, Mr. Cameraman.

544
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,367
- She bring it
to you every ball.

545
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,233
Why y'all gagging so?

546
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,800
Did you understand that?

547
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,433
If not, you could use
a refresher course

548
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,166
in drag linguistics.

#ShitMyGirlsSay.

550
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,867
- Can you say "not on tonight,"
Miss Roxxxy?

551
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,233
- Not tonight.

552
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:05,667
- No.
"Not on tonight."

553
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,066
- That makes no sense, girl.

554
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,767
- "Mama, they ain't gonna be
able to read me.

555
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,100
Not on tonight."

556
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
Not on tonight.

557
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,233
Not on
tonight.

558
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,900
Not on tonight.

559
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,400
- I've had it.

560
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,133
I have had it.

561
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,567
I've had it, officially!

562
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,600
- Detox, I'ma need you to stop
playing with my outfit.

563
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,667
- Well, I'm gonna need you
to stop relying on your body.

564
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,700
[laughter]

565
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,667
- Whoo!

566
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,300
- Stop relying on that body.

567
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,233
- Stop relying
on that body.

568
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,166
- Stop relying on that body.

569
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,867
- Stop relying
on that body.

570
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,600
- Stop relying
on Sharon Needles.

571
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,633
- The time has come for our

572
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:51,433
next up close
and personal profile.

573
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:56,934
Top three queen, the sleeper
from Seattle--Jinkx Monsoon.

574
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,166
- Ow!

575
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,166
[laughter]

576
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,633
- At 14, Jinkx's drag career

577
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:05,767
started with a wig
her grandmother gave her.

578
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,700
- And I've had it ever since.

579
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,967
- She brought her show biz
skills to RuPaulywood.

580
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,900
- ♪ Can I get an amen ♪

581
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,700
- From the very start, Jinkx
kept getting the same criticism.

582
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,867
- It's rather pedestrian.

583
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,166
- But before you could say...

584
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,333
- Water off a duck's back.

585
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,834
Water off
a duck's back.

586
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:25,266
- Jinkx became a real contender.

587
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,233
[gasps]

588
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,233
- I love it!

589
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,233
- Ah!

590
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,133
- And her breakout performance

591
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,967
as Little Edie got everybody
talking.

592
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,500
- This is the revolutionary
costume for the day.

593
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,233
- From Snatch Game on,
Jinkx gained momentum.

594
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,800
-<i> Si, si, si!</i>

595
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,767
- But she nearly crashed
at the sugar ball.

596
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:47,066
At last week's courtroom,
she brought the drama, mama.

597
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,333
- You can't handle the "T"!

598
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:53,266
- And as one of the most
talented comedy queens ever,

599
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:55,467
Jinkx has stolen our hearts.

600
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,100
But can she mop the title

601
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,834
of America's Next Drag
Superstar?

00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:00,900

Still, looking good never hurts.

I've invited back our reigning
queen Sharon Needles.

663
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,066
- [laughing] Hi, Ru.
How are you?

664
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,934
- Now, everyone wants to know.

665
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,233
Who do you want to win?

666
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,967
- That's an obvious answer.

667
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,533
Lil' Pound Cake.

668
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,367
[both laughing]

669
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:56,700
- So if Alaska wins, can two
queens live happily ever after?

670
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,166
- Yeah, she spent a year
blowing my prize money.

671
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,967
So I would love to just get
a little bit of that back.

672
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,200
- Now, I wanna ask you
about winning,

673
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,900
and how has it changed
your life?

674
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,767
- This year has been
a nightmare, um, come true.

675
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,433
I've gotten to travel the world,

676
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,400
I've been the face of PETA,

677
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,467
I played Frank Furter in the
<i>Rocky Horror Picture Show,</i>

678
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,667
I came out with a whole album.

679
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,500
Um, what the crown can do
for you

680
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,767
is make all your dreams come
true if you let it.

681
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,266
- Yeah, wow.

682
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:25,667
- And it's been great to see
kids all over the world identify

683
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,433
with this, you know, kooky,

684
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,133
spooky, bat-shit crazy
drag queen

685
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:33,433
that I really thought would
just, uh, be making people

686
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,700
laugh in small bars
in Pittsburgh.

687
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,133
- Sharon, any words of wisdom

688
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,667
for America's Next
Drag Superstar?

689
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,066
- What other people think of you

690
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,100
ain't none
of your damn business.

691
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,333
- That's right.

692
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,767
- My advice, when in doubt,
freak 'em out.

693
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,500
And of course, what Lady Bunny
always says, "Retire!"

to shamelessly plug?

717
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,834
- Wow.

718
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:40,967
That's the best mothertuckin'
playlist ever.

719
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:42,800
But on a serious note...

720
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,767
today you can vote
with your pocketbook.

721
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,066
So get off your ass,
go to a club,

722
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,800
and support
your local drag queens.

723
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,433
- Ru.
- [gasps]

724
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,834
- That was beautiful.
- Oh, Sharon.

725
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:56,934
I didn't know you were there.

726
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,066
You really are spooky.

727
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,700
I thought you had left.

728
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,400
- Boo.

729
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,066
- It's time to get up close
and personal

730
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:10,567
with top three queen
Roxxxy Andrews.

731
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,734
<i>Hey.</i>

732
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:13,900
Where my people at?

733
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,800
<i>A cute kid from Orlando,</i>

734
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,867
<i>Roxxxy Andrews got her start</i>
<i>as a pageant queen.</i>

735
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,333
<i>She dropped 70 pounds...</i>

736
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,567
70 pounds?

737
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,500
<i>Before dropping</i>
<i>into the competition.</i>

738
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,233
<i>But she never lost her thick</i>
<i>and juicy personality.</i>

739
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,633
<i>She won the first main</i>
<i>challenge,</i>

740
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>then formed the super group</i>
<i>Rolaskatox.</i>

741
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,367
<i>A true knockout, Roxxxy always</i>
<i>came out swinging,</i>

742
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,000
<i>on the runway</i>
<i>or in the werk room.</i>

743
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,033
- This isn't a joke to me.

744
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,233
- I don't think--

745
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,567
- This competition
is extremely serious.

746
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,133
-<i> Roxxxy proved she could make</i>
<i>us laugh...</i>

747
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,533
- [with lisp] I am ready
to toss your salad, Anita.

748
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,300
Get your life.

749
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
-<i> Make us cry...</i>

750
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,567
- [crying]

751
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:56,300
-<i> And she could even make over</i>
<i>a soldier.</i>

752
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,333
<i>And in the music video,</i>
<i>Roxxxy's</i>

753
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,166
<i>hairography blew the other</i>
<i>girls away.</i>

754
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,967
She could also be the first big
girl

755
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:08,266
to snatch the title of America's
Next Drag Superstar.

756
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,867
If you want Roxxxy,
let the world know.

757
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:16,200
Tweet us @RuPaulsDragRace
#TeamRoxxxy,

758
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,433
or show her some love
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

759
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:21,166
Facebook page or Instagram.

760
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,166
Coming up...

761
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,967
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode.</i>

762
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,100
Plus, a Ruvealing interview.

763
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,900
Don't mess with me, little boy.

764
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,200
And later, the music video world
premiere of<i> The Beginning.</i>

765
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,700
Don't move a love muscle because

766
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,767
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown</i>

767
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,867
is about to pop off.

768
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,800
[laughing]

769
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,266
[laughing]

770
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,467
Now, sometimes when you tuck
things away, they get lost,

771
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:57,066
especially if you've been
sitting all day.

772
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:01,333
But lucky for you,
the long-lost episode

773
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,600
of<i> Untucked</i>
has not only been found,

774
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,900
it's been restored,
filled with extra

775
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,467
dramatic sound effects,
and brought to us by its host:

776
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,600
the one and only RuPaul.

777
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,633
Hello, hello, hello.

778
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,500
My dear, you look gorgeous.

779
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,467
Oh, you.

780
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,867
So what do you got for us?

781
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:21,133
Girl, it's a doozy.

782
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,166
I can't wait.

783
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,066
Rupaul, is it true that you

784
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,667
never get to see<i> Untucked</i>
until the show airs?

785
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,734
Yes, I see it
when America sees it.

786
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:34,133
They shoot<i> Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> when the</i>
judges and I are deliberating.

787
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,767
So it's not like I can be
in two places at once.

788
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,333
Duh.
Duh!

789
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,767
Now, Ru, while I have you here,

790
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:42,734
fans are dying to know what was
up with your lighting, girl,

791
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:43,734
in season one?

792
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,567
We couldn't even see you, child.

793
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:46,867
"Exsqueeze" me?

794
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,066
And just how damn old are you?

795
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,967
Oh, it's gonna be like that,
huh?

796
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,066
Are those your real teeth?

797
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,834
Well, I bought 'em.

798
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:57,834
Hey, Urkel, uh, you trying to go
<i>Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on me right now?</i>

799
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,066
Don't mess with me, little boy.

800
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,500
Oh, no "T," no shade,
Miss Thing.

801
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,633
Let's keep it cute.

802
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,834
Yeah, uh-huh.
That's what I thought.

803
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:08,266
Now, without further ado,
for the first time anywhere,

804
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:11,367
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode.</i>

805
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,500
Welcome to<i> Untucked.</i>

806
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,367
This week, our top three queens
took it to court,

807
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:24,734
stating their cases for becoming
America's Next Drag Superstar.

808
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:27,200
- What they don't have,
I do have.

809
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,967
I have grace.
I have beauty.

810
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,867
I have professionalism.

811
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,300
- I was able to adapt and grow

812
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,600
while still being true
to who I am as a performer.

813
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
- Roxxxy was faced with

814
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,066
a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.

815
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:43,900
What did she present?

816
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,066
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.

817
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:53,233
And Jinkx Monsoon, she failed
three different looks.

818
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,333
-<i> Afterwards, Roxxxy, Alaska,</i>
<i>and Jinkx</i>

819
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,333
<i>headed to</i>
<i>the Interior Illusions Lounge</i>

820
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:02,934
<i>to have an Absolut cocktail</i>
<i>and let off some steam.</i>

821
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,500
- So how do y'all feel?

822
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,600
- Well, I wrote out the things

823
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,834
that I was gonna say
specifically about you two.

824
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,300
Then all of it seemed forced.

825
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,734
I was ready to tear down Roxxxy
and compare myself to Alaska.

826
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:19,934
But on the stage,
none of that seemed to matter.

827
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,100
- I knew exactly where I wanted

828
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,934
to go with it and made,
like, an outline.

829
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,633
But when I went to on the stage,

830
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,233
I was just coming
from the heart.

831
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:30,066
I made a choice not to call
everybody out on this runway

832
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,400
because doing that is not me.

833
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,300
- I just did the assignment.

834
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,700
I mean, we were supposed to,
like, cite exact things.

835
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,233
- Oh, Miss Thing.

836
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:46,300
Like, I could've sat there and
critiqued Jinkx and, you know,

837
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
critiqued Alaska
and these things--

838
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,433
I didn't wanna go there.
I just wanted to say--

839
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:53,300
- But I think that's
what they wanted us to do.

840
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,800
The assignment was specifically
not to give pageant answers.

841
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,433
Sorry, it's hard,
but it's our last challenge.

842
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,567
- I don't know.

843
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,600
I-I--all I could say was
that what I have,

844
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,066
you guys don't have, so--

845
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,367
- Like beauty and grace?

846
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,066
You said that onstage.

847
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:17,600
- No, I know.

848
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,433
- I may not have grace...

849
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:21,934
- [slurping]

850
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:24,266
- But I can possess beauty.

851
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:27,867
You can take a garbage bag
and be a fucking beauty queen.

852
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,667
You can be glamorous without,

853
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,567
like, 1,000 million stones
on your dress.

854
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,300
- It's just how I know
how to do drag.

855
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:41,233
Right now in the gold bar,
there's a lot of tension.

856
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:44,266
It was, once again,
my defense going up.

857
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:48,066
And I realized
that I owed them an apology.

858
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,934
This has been such
a learning experience.

859
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:52,900
In the pageant world, I feel
like I'm on top of my game.

860
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,333
And coming into this,
it's a whole nother story,

861
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,266
where you're up against
all these girls

862
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,600
that can beat you
at other things.

863
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,100
You're competing to be
the Next Drag Superstar.

864
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,066
And a superstar is not just

865
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,667
someone who can walk a runway
in a gown and be--

866
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,233
you know,
anybody can kinda do that.

867
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,266
- Except us.
- [laughs] Exc--

868
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:15,300
- Except you two 'cause you--
you can't possess it.

869
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,367
But, you know,
and anybody can do that.

870
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:20,066
And it's so much more than that.

871
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,533
- You know what's so funny,

872
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,166
is it has really been a similar
experience for me,

873
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,400
but in such a different way.

874
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,600
It got to a point where I felt
so attacked by other drag queens

875
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,467
because I have my own way
of doing things.

876
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,667
And then I come here,

877
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,600
and then all of a sudden
I'm not a pretty girl,

878
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,166
I'm the comedy girl.

879
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,400
Where back home, I'm, like, one

880
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,967
of the prettiest drag queens
there are.

881
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,300
- And I didn't have to bring it
up on the runway,

882
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,767
but I really

883
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,233
wanted to apologize for what
I said to you in the werk room.

884
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,567
It was being mean and--

885
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,066
and I didn't mean it.

886
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:54,400
- It meant something to me that
you apologized,

887
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,467
just so that our last
interaction together

888
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:00,934
didn't have to be a fight.

889
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,367
-<i> Wow. Bam, bam.</i>

890
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,700
Oops.<i> </i>
<i>Bam, bam.</i>

891
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,133
Oh!<i> </i>
<i>On fire.</i>

892
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,233
Oh!

893
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:07,900
You caught me playing
with myself.

894
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,433
I mean, playing my fabulous new

Are you Team Alaska, Team Jinkx,

901

Or the sleeper queen,
Jinkx Monsoon,

916
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:26,467
who brought Broadway brass
and vintage va-va-voom?

how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?

932
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,100
Can I get an amen up in here?

00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,066
all: Amen.

934
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,233

935

Now let the music video play.

936
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,266

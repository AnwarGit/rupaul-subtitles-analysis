00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,400
-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,333
You'll be competing
in the RuPaul roast.

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,166
- Ru, you're acting to me, um--

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,200
[clears throat]

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,734
- What do you call it
when you flatline?

6
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:13,867
- Fuck.

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,433
- I'm not acting when I say

8
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,767
I'm insecure about things.

9
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,033
- It's all bullshit.

10
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:21,633
- Girl, you look like
the black Pee-wee Herman.

11
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,633
[laughter]

12
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:24,700
- RuPaul's next...

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,667
[microphone feedback]

14
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,667
Drag queen of the year--

15
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,967
[microphone feedback]

16
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,266
- Coco Montrese,

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,500
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
Condragulations.

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,367
- [cries]

20
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:39,433
- What's going on?

21
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,400
- My mother
left my sister and myself

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,367
at a bus stop when I was three.

23
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,567
It just hurt that I was left.

24
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:49,166
- As gay people,
we get to choose our family.

25
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,367
We are family here.

26
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,100
What you two did on this runway

27
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,633
is the passion I am looking for.

28
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:01,300
Shante, you both stay.

29
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,367
- Oh, my god, my god, my god.

30
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:10,367
My god.

31
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,467
- Oh. Are we all a mess?

32
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,533
- So we're walking
back into the workroom,

33
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:18,900
and I just finished
having the breakdown of my life.

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,433
I know y'all don't understand
what I was saying

35
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,500
'cause I was crying so much,

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,667
but it all just hit me.

37
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,633
I have never cried
about being left by my mom.

38
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,200
- Ever?
- Ever!

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,934
I was left at a bus stop
by my real mother,

40
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:31,700
and I was sent to an orphanage.

41
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,767
I've always felt rejection.

42
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,800
Part of me comes off
as such a strong character.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,100
You know, like
when y'all were reading me,

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,467
you and Jade and stuff like--

45
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,233
that comes from being rejected.

46
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,967
The way I tend
to react to rejection

47
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,200
is getting very angry.

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,133
I was angry, and the easiest
target was Jinkx.

49
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,800
I totally took it out on her.

50
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,900
And that's not fair.

51
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,734
And Jinkx, I'm sorry.

52
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:01,734
- After seeing what Roxxxy
went through tonight,

53
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:04,467
I can't stay mad at her,
you know.

54
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:09,066
We have all been through so much
shit in our lives.

55
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,266
- Roxxxy Andrews is my sister,

56
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,600
and I'm so happy
that she's still here.

57
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,900
But it's still top seven
and not top six.

58
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,500
And I know I'm annoyed.

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,300
And I think a lot
of other girls are annoyed.

60
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,633
- This has been rough
fucking day.

61
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,700
I still am the one queen
who hasn't won a challenge.

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,800
- I can't believe I got it
with you two in the room.

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,867
What the hell?

64
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:33,066
The two comedy queens of
oh, my god.

65
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,367
I won?

66
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,166
What happened
to the funny girls?

67
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,834
Jinkx, Alaska.

68
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,233
- I just really
want to win a challenge.

69
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,633
- This was a challenge
right up your alley.

70
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:50,233
Do you feel, like, Coco,
you know--

71
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,700
- These other queens don't think

72
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,633
that I'm a force
to be reckoned with.

73
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,600
Good.

74
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,667
It's called a sneak attack.

75
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,800
I'ma get you, girl.

[overlapping chatter]

- Today, I'm feeling
a little on edge.

Me and Roxxxy
both are still here.

90
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,500
But I think that the girls
wanted one of us to go home.

91
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,066
- Finally, the top six.

92
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,433
Oh, wait.
- [laughs]

93
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,967
- Nope. Alyssa's still here.

94
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,066
- Aw, man.

95
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,100
[siren wails]

96
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
all: Ooh!

97
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,133
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.

98
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,567
Hey, ladies.

99
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,333
Can you smell me?

100
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,400
Mm.

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,600
It's the sweet
smell of success.

102
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,233
Remember,
America's next drag superstar

103
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:10,100
needs to follow her nose
wherever it goes.

104
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,700
Good luck.

105
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,133
And don't funk it up.

106
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,900
- What?
- Smell?

107
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,166
- Hello, hello, hello.

108
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,333
- Hello.

109
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,233
- Now at this point in the race,

110
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,367
you must be getting
a little homesick

111
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,367
or lonely for boyfriends

112
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,500
or just miss having
a little sexy fun.

113
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,533
- [chuckles]

114
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,533
- Well, I have just the remedy.

115
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,667
Oh, pit crew.

116
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,066
- Oh!

117
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:40,900
- Come on.

118
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,066
[all cheering]

119
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,467
- Mmm.

120
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,700
- What?

121
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,867
- What?

122
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,600
- What the hell?

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,867
[squeals]

124
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:51,800
- [wolf whistle]

125
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,266
- Oh, my god, it doesn't stop.

126
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,567
- Oh.

127
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:59,934
- Say hello to designer
Andrew Christian.

128
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:02,400
Andrew, thank you
for keeping the pit crew

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,467
looking so hot all season.

130
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,200
- I'm very dedicated to my work.

131
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,433
- I bet you are.

132
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,834
Now, ladies,
Andrew has brought his models

133
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:16,066
to play a little game
of whatcha packin'?

134
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,433
-<i> You know</i>
<i>what I'm talking about.</i>

135
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,667
- [laughs]

136
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,367
- You ask a model to drop trou

137
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,934
and reveal
his Andrew Christians.

138
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,066
- Oh!

139
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,300
- Your job is
to find the matching pair.

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,834
[laughter]

141
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:36,567
Now, the queen that makes all
the matches the fastest wins.

142
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,633
- Oh, my god.

143
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:40,667
- First up, Ivy Winters.

144
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,867
- [laughs]

145
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,800
- The rest of you,
wait outside for your turn.

146
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:50,367
All right, Ivy, choose a model.

147
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:54,400
- Number 9.

148
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,467
[laughs]

149
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,867
- Oh.

150
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:57,867
- 14, please.

151
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,333
[buzzer]
- Not a match.

152
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,433
Next pick.
- Number 10.

153
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,767
- Damn.

154
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,600
You're gonna put somebody's
eyes out with that thing.

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,900
- 18.

156
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,233
[ding]
- We got a match.

157
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,533
How did we end up
in the meatpacking district?

158
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,800
- [laughs]

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,433
- Number 6.

160
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,633
both: Red.

161
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,667
- Now wait a minute.

162
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,867
- Wait. Oh, no.

163
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,567
I forgot what one was red.

164
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:18,700
- [laughs]
- I'm so distracted.

165
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,066
[laughs]

166
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:23,300
I am trying to memorize what boy
has got what underwear on.

167
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,767
And at the same time,
I'm just thinking,

168
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,066
god, this guy's really hot.

169
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,066
- Pick a model.

170
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,633
- 22.

171
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,133
- Ooh, pretty in pink.

172
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,433
- Oh, my god.

173
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,533
[shrieks]

174
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,867
I could play this game all day.

175
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:40,300
- It's like the Rockettes
only a lot more cock.

176
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,533
- 6.

177
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,533
9.

178
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,600
- Not a match.

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,066
- 11.

180
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,433
21.
[buzzer]

181
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,433
- No match.

182
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,600
- I was so close.

183
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,934
- I know,
you were about this close.

184
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,233
[laughter]

185
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,967
- 2 and 5.

186
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,066
[buzzer]

187
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,667
Son of a bitch.

188
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,633
17.

189
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,066
- Ooh.
- Oh.

190
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,066
- Seen that color before
somewhere.

191
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,100
- 8.

192
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,066
[buzzer]

193
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,100
Oh, wait.
Son of a bitch.

194
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,166
- Oh, damn it.

195
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,066
- Take them the fuck off.
I've had it.

196
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,800
- [laughs]

197
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
- Number 6 and number 7.

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,367
[buzzer]

199
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,500
- Ooh, not a match.

200
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,967
Alyssa, you're not doing
very well here.

201
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,066
- No, I'm doing very well.

202
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:19,066
I'm just not making any matches.

203
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,667
- Exactly, exactly.

204
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,066
- 15 and 7.

205
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,734
[ding]
- We got a match.

206
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:30,500
I don't know why
but I'm craving a corn dog.

207
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,066
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

208
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,433
every straight woman
and gay man in America.

209
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,633
[laughter]

210
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:47,867
But one of you de-pants
these boys in record time.

211
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,567
The winner is...

212
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,500
Ivy Winters!

213
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
- [laughs]

214
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,867
Yay.

215
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,066
[laughs]

216
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,333
- You've won a phone call home.

217
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,734
- [gasps]
- Oh.

218
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,600
- I'm so happy I won
the mini challenge.

219
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'll be able to call my mom.

220
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
- Ladies, you know
you've reached the height

221
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,400
of superstardom when you have
your own fragrance.

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,066
For this week's main challenge,

223
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,767
you'll be creating and marketing

224
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,266
your own signature fragrance.

225
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,266
- [gasps]

226
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,066
- You'll come up with the scent,

227
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:27,967
a name, a package, and then
film your own commercial.

228
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:31,600
Gentlemen, start your engines.

229
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,467
And may the best woman...

230
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:37,800
[magical tone]

231
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,066
Win.

232
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,700
- Damn it, I wanted that.

233
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,533
You cunt.

234
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,834
- I'm so excited.

235
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,767
We've been doing
comedy after comedy.

236
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,367
A perfume ad
is something that me,

237
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:55,333
a pageant girl,
would like to do.

238
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,567
[bottles clatter]
- [gasps]

239
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,800
- Shit.

240
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,867
- How many did she--
drops did she say goes in?

241
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,200
- It depends on how you make it.

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
- Alyssa doesn't even
notice that

243
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,600
she's knocked a whole
bottle of oil all over me.

244
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,367
Yeah, I got to start over again.

245
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,300
Alyssa just doesn't think
past her own wig.

246
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,066
You know, it's all about Alyssa.

247
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,633
And it's pissing me off.

248
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,100
- My fragrance
is called Ruanimale.

249
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,233
- Does it smell like me
or does it smell like you?

250
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,567
- It smells like food
and maple and--

251
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,367
- Yeah, it smells like IHOP.

252
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,533
[laughs]

253
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,166
- [laughs]

254
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
- For the main challenge,

255
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,433
we have to create a scent...

256
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,734
- Ugh.
[coughs]

257
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:48,400
- Design a slogan,
the perfume bottle,

258
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
and shoot a commercial.

259
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,700
- Does everyone have an idea
of where you want to go?

260
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,767
- Kind of.

261
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,300
I think I've got like
a general idea.

262
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
- And what are you
gonna call it?

263
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,934
- Ivy winter's Poison Rosebud.

264
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,567
- [laughs]
That's cute.

265
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,000
- I've always been interested

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
in making my own perfume.

267
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,533
I've thought about
going to school for it.

268
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:06,700
I think I'm creative enough

269
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,200
to come up with
a really delicious perfume.

270
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,567
- Oh, it's so good,
I just want to

271
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,500
spray it all over my body
right now.

272
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,133
- [laughs]

273
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,533
- I haven't won a challenge yet,

274
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,567
so it's do or die.

275
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm taking my gut reaction

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,066
and just running
straight forward with it.

277
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:26,500
Did somebody get fresh dirt?

278
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm using things like dirt,
leather--

279
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,500
earthy and dirty,

280
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
which is totally my brand.

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,467
Oh, my god.

282
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,934
I love it.

283
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,800
- Mm, what you got going on?

284
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
- It's gonna start
like it's the morning after.

285
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,467
- Yeah.

286
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,000
- And have the pit crew
and me, like,

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,867
laying on a sofa or something
as if we had a threesome.

288
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,233
- That's a cute idea.

289
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,467
- I've been told continuously
in this competition,

290
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,133
"Girl, I don't get you."

291
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:58,100
But there's one person
who always gets who I am

292
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
and what I'm doing.

293
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,200
And it's Ivy.

294
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
- What about you?

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,533
- I'm doing a poison rosebud.

296
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,734
[both laugh]

297
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:07,066
- You know, a rosebud
is a synonym for asshole.

298
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,900
- I know,
that's why I'm using it.

299
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,867
- Just checking.

300
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,300
- Jinkx is amazing.

301
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,100
I feel like
I can relate to her a lot,

302
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
and the other girls
are totally threatened,

303
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,500
so that's why they're
all kind of nitpicking at her.

304
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,734
- Any help from me at all,

305
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:19,767
just let me know.

306
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,734
- Okay, honey.

307
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:21,767
I got to get back
to my rosebuds.

308
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:22,800
- Go prune the roses.

309
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,166
- [laughs]

310
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,333
- Hello, hello, hello.

311
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,700
- Hi, Ru.

312
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,934
- How are my little stinkers
doing?

313
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,400
[laughter]

314
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,300
- Alaska.
- Hi.

315
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,066
- Is your fragrance gonna
represent Alaska?

316
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,066
- It is.

317
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,066
It smells delicious,

318
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,500
but it's also a little weird.

319
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
- Huh.

320
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,433
- Do you want to smell it?

321
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,300
- Yeah, I would love
to smell it.

322
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,233
It's not gonna make me sick,
is it?

323
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,367
- Well, I hope not.

324
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,166
You're the first guinea pig,
so--

325
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,667
- [inhales deeply]

326
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,100
[groaning]

327
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,133
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah,
yeah.

328
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,533
- My fragrance is called Red.

329
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,767
- Has Red been used before?

330
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,767
- Oh.

331
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,066
I think he's right.

332
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:07,066
Which means
I have to make up a tagline.

333
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,166
- All right, Alaska.

334
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,600
Good luck, and I can't wait
to smell you.

335
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,567
- Thank you, Ru.

336
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,066
- All right.

337
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,500
- Roxxxy Andrews.

338
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,266
Look at that bottle.
- Hi, Ru.

339
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,767
- What's the name
of your fragrance?

340
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,934
- My name of my fragrance
is Thick &amp; Juicy.

341
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,734
- Oh, my goodness.

342
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,867
- It's all about confidence.

343
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,567
And you have to embrace
and love yourself.

344
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,633
And like I told you guys,

345
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,200
I've embraced myself
with how I look,

346
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,367
and I want to
share that with everybody.

347
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,066
And wearing this is gonna
help you get confidence.

348
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,100
- Can I smell it?

349
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,333
- The smell is delicious.

350
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,066
It smells like food and maple

351
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,700
and jasmine at the same time.

352
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
- Oh, my goodness, yes.

353
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,800
It smells like IHOP.

354
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,934
Ooh, your country breakfast
is ready.

355
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,333
Y'all hungry?

356
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,800
Listen, you have
a lot of work to do here

357
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,367
'cause you know,

358
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,967
you were in the bottom two
last week,

359
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,934
so this has really
got to pop for you.

360
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,367
I'll see you then.
- Okay.

361
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,166

for the consumer?

372

- No, because it says
Ruanimale by Coco.

373
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,567
- Ru is a little concerned
about the name.

But every perfume line
has a spokesperson.

to be left for the imagination.

00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:12,433
[lion snarling]

546
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,600
- I feel like I'm watching
<i>The Lion King</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now.</i>

547
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
- [laughs]

548
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,667
[elephant trumpets]

549
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,233
- I just don't know how well

550
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,400
she's gonna be able to recover

551
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,467
from all that leopard.

552
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,133
- It's Detox.

553
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,300
- Hi.

554
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
- First of all, what's the name
of your scent?

555
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
- Heroine.

556
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,900
- Hmm.

557
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,633
- It's kind of a double entendre

558
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,066
of the drug heroin

559
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,233
because my name is Detox

560
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,600
and a heroine,

561
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,433
which is a really strong
female figure.

562
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,934
And I feel like I embody
all of that.

563
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,633
- And action.

564
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,400
- Detox.

565
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,667
[whispers]
Sexy.

566
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,233
[deep voice]
Heroine.

567
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,734
[whispers]
Seductive.

568
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:53,467
[deep voice]
Heroine.

569
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:56,066
[whispers]
Get high.

570
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,633
[inhales]

571
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,533
Ah.

572
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,533
- [giggles]

573
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,500
- And cut.

574
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,900
- I don't think whispering

575
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
always means sexy.

576
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,367
- It's trying too hard.

578
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,767
Just mean the word.

579
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:08,800
- Okay.

580
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
- Detox is beautiful,
tall, great hair,

581
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,900
but I don't really
remember the commercial at all.

582
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,200
- Alyssa Edwards.

583
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,133
Action.

584
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,734
- Every woman has a secret.

585
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,033
Mine happens to be
a little bigger.

586
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,266
- Wha--what did you say?

587
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,266
- [laughs]

588
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,100
Oh, girl.

589
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,400
My secret--

590
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,433
[laughs]

591
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,133
I'm a man.

592
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,734
[laughs]

593
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,433
A scent sophisticated
for the everyday woman,

594
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:46,433
yet strong enough
for the career lady.

595
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,500
- And cut.

596
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,867
- You're real hard right now.

597
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:49,900
Make me like you.

598
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,200
Right now I'm like, ugh.

599
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,300
She's real pretty,
but her personality is crazy.

600
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,834
- Every woman has a secret.

601
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,500
Um...

602
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
uh, what was my next line?

603
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,300
Oh, let me start again.

604
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,367
Sorry.

605
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,166
I just feel so damn tense.

606
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,200
- You look it.

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,900
- I can talk to people
all day long,

608
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,867
but the minute someone says,

609
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,133
"Here are the lines,

610
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,767
say it," game over.

611
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,166
- Roxxxy Andrews.

612
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,266
- Hi.

613
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:21,133
- So, what's the name
of your scent?

614
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,367
- My scent, just like me,

615
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,900
is Thick &amp; Juicy.

616
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,166
- Action.

617
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,200
- Thick &amp; Juicy,

618
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,433
for the girls that are a little
thick and juicy.

619
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,533
And it smells just like food.

620
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,533
- Cut.

621
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:39,533
- Okay, we're gonna
do that again.

622
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,700
- [inhales]

623
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,066
Mmm. And tastes
just like my favorite foods.

624
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,500
Maple, chocolate,
and a little bit of everything.

625
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,233
- Cut.

626
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,333
- And smells
just like maple syrup,

627
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,633
chocolate, and watermelon.

628
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,066
- Cut.

629
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,066
I feel like you're making up
your words.

630
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,934
What did you plan to say, Rox?

631
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:01,900
- I planned to say that

632
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,066
it smells so good
you can eat it,

633
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,166
but then I was, like, "Hold on.

634
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,233
Perfume, you can't eat it."

635
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,533
- Okay.

636
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:12,066
So, you ended up with,
"I don't know"?

637
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,066
All right.

638
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,300
- Hi, Alaska.

639
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,066
Tell us the name of your scent.

640
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:19,367
- Red for filth.

641
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,834
- Oh, work!

642
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,066
- Okay, do you have any modeling

643
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,500
or scene work or anything?

644
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,767
- For dangerous, flawless,

645
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:27,433
seductive, and overpriced.

646
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:30,100
She's gonna be,
like, turning around and,

647
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,700
like, catching the camera.

648
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,266
And then it cross-fades.

649
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,233
And then turn around.

650
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,367
- Girl.

651
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:40,433
- Let's do this.

652
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,233
All right.

653
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,633
- Seductive.

654
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,533
Overpriced.

655
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,934
Those all look kind of the same.

656
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,066
- Uh-huh.

657
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,133
- Maybe you should just do it

658
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,600
one right after the other
like Wonder Woman.

659
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Just keep spinning.

660
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,333
- Okay.
- And don't stop.

661
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,200
Dangerous.

662
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Spin!

663
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,667
Seductive!

664
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,667
Overpriced!

665
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,066
[laughter]

666
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,500
- I love Red to filth.

667
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,066
She knew exactly
what she wanted to do,

668
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:18,633
and she took control.

669
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,900
And at the end of the day,

670
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,667
that's more impressive
than any win you can get.

671
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,700
- I think we've got it.

672
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,633
- Okay.

673
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,066
- That's a wrap, Ms. Alaska.

674
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,066
- Thank you, guys.

675
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,400
- Good job.

676
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,934
- Can I open up to you about
something?

677
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,066
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,834
- I have a crush on Ivy Winters.

679
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:33,867
- [gasps]

680
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,066
- I love you.

681
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,066
[crying]

682
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,066
- [laughs]

683
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:42,066
- [laughs]

684
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,300
[overlapping chatter]

685
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,066
- Here we are, again.

686
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,400
Today is elimination day.

687
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
And like usual,
I'm scrambling around

688
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,800
and trying to get a really good
runway look together.

689
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,834
I'm going through my suitcases,

690
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,066
and I completely forgot that

691
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,500
I packed this photo book.

692
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,333
I have to show you guys
something.

693
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,967
This is my friend Caldwell's
photo book

694
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:12,133
chronicling the House of Haute.

695
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,200
- Oh, how much fun is that.

696
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,166
- Oh, my gosh, how neat.

697
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,066
Are you really onstage naked?

698
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:19,300
- Girl, we do some shit, girl.

699
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,533
With all of, like,
my family and my friends.

700
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,867
That's in the airport

701
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:26,133
the day Sharon came back
from<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

702
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,333
Getting to, like, see this book

703
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,700
that I totally forgot
that I had,

704
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,734
was like a huge,
like, shot in the arm.

705
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:33,700
[crying]

706
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,066
It was just so, like,
encouraging.

707
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:40,100
And it just makes me feel
renewed completely.

708
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,133
- I won the mini challenge,

709
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,533
and my prize
is getting to call to my mom.

710
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,567
Hi.

711
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,667
I'm so happy.

712
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,700
[laughs]

713
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,667
- I'm just so happy
to see your face.

714
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,867
[laughter]

715
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,066
- Seeing all the girls having

716
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,800
such tragic stories
with their families,

717
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,367
it made me really start thinking

718
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,100
about how special
you guys are to me.

719
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,834
- Aww.

720
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:08,734
- And I'm so blessed
to have such an amazing family.

721
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,133
- Yeah.

722
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,400
[laughing, crying]

723
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
When I was little,
I did a lot of theater,

724
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,333
and I was always nervous.

725
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,867
And she'd always,
like, squeeze my hand,

726
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:24,934
just to let me know

727
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,467
that everything
was gonna be all right.

728
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,533
And you know, she's proud of me.

729

00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:13,066
And my secret happens to be
a little bigger.

913
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,367
And what exactly is my secret?

914
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,533
[laughs]

915
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,200
Why, it's Alyssa's secret.

916
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,467
For the desired
and the inspired.

917
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,900
- I don't even know
what you're selling me,

918
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
but I don't want this.

919
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,900
I want to change the channel.

920
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,967
- You do this thing
with your eyes

921
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,767
and it's like this sexy,

922
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,200
like, open 'em
and then close 'em.

923
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
I've gotten this note
a million times

924
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,600
which is why I'm just
passing it your way.

925
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,333
Less is more
'cause it almost gets

926
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,800
a little serial killer-ish.

927
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,500
[laughter]

928
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,533
- Jinkx, are you all right?

929
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,200
- Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

930
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm just saying, "Water
off a duck's back" to myself.

931
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,166
Um, before my critiques.

932
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,066
- That's a great mantra.

933
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,734
- Words can't hurt you.

934
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:57,300
Only your own perception
of those words.

935
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,900
- Let's see your
fragrance commercial.

936
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,400
- For the girl
who lives above her means.

937
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,900
For the girl
who just won't give up.

938
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,066
For the girl with a dream.

939
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,867
Delusion.

940
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,834
[laughs]

941
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,400
Convince yourself.

942
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,133
- [laughs]

943
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,567
- I thought
it was the best concept.

944
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,533
No tea, no shade, hunty,

945
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:27,066
but I think it's my favorite.

946
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,467
- I'll have what she's having.

947
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:29,867
- [laughs]

948
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,333
- I don't even have enough words

949
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:35,834
for how happy I am tonight
with your look.

950
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:37,133
- Thank you.

951
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,633
- All right, Roxxxy Andrews.

952
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,633
- Thick &amp; Juicy.

953
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,367
For the girls who are like me.

954
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:46,734
Thick &amp; Juicy.

955
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,500
For the girls that like to eat

956
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,367
and don't worry
about being petite.

957
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,433
[inhales]

958
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,600
Mmm.

959
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,700
- Tonight on the runway,

960
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,967
I'm not in love
with that bow placement

961
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,567
right in the front.

962
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:00,867
When you turn to the side,

963
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,800
it's really kind of
sticking out.

964
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,066
- Roxxxy is another one

965
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:06,867
who came in with not much
of a concept.

966
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,066
You didn't have anything
written down.

967
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,367
You were just kind of
winging it,

968
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,500
which made it different
kind of each time.

969
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,800
- I know it kind of
seemed confusing to you

970
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,233
when I kept switching my words.

971
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,266
- It wasn't confusing.

972
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,467
It was unprofessional.

973
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,700
- Oh.

974
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,333
- I think we've heard enough.

975
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,233
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

976
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:24,767
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

977
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:28,367
the judges and I
will deliberate.

978
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,533
All right.

979
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:32,266
Just between us girls,
what do you stink?

980
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:34,934
We're gonna start
with Alyssa's secret.

981
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,734
Ooh.
- Right?

982
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:39,300
- It smells like
a Kardashian sex tape.

983
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,133
- If you ask her,
"What's your secret?"

984
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,200
And she's, "Well, I don't know.

985
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,233
I don't know."

986
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,333
She's not delivering her brand

987
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,233
and, therefore, her secret.

988
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:48,133
- Coco Montrese.

989
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,567
- Ruanimale is by far the worst.

990
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,967
- It smells like mating time
at the zoo.

991
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,166
- Not only is it
kissing your ass,

992
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,834
which I normally
don't have a problem with--

993
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,834
- [laughs]

994
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:57,934
- But they were supposed to be

995
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,633
expressing themselves
in their fragrance.

996
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:00,800
- Right.

997
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,333
I think her campaign,
and her in general,

998
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,367
is obvious, unoriginal,
and overdone.

999
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,934
- Ooh, okay.
- Ooh.

1000
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:09,467
- Let's go next to Alaska.

1001
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:10,800
- I enjoyed the commercial,

1002
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
and I loved her outfit
on the runway

1003
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,500
carrying the red theme through.

1004
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,600
- I love the perfume.

1005
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,667
Hers is the only one
that I would wear.

1006
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:22,934
Everything else
smells like grandma's vag to me.

1007
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,333
- [laughs]

1008
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,734
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.

1009
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,934
- I think she missed everything
completely.

1010
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:30,867
- I'm just clocking that bottle.

1011
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,800
It does look like
a Christmas ornament.

1012
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,533
And I think
it smells like something

1013
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,400
my housekeeper used yesterday
in the bathroom.

1014
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,533
- Or did in the bathroom.

1015
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,600
- Oh, my goodness!

1016
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
All right.

1017
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,467
Heroine by Detox.

1018
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,934
Joan Van Ark,
what'd you think of Detox?

1019
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,467
And not your own
personal experiences--

1020
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:46,567
- [laughs]
With it?

1021
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,734
I don't share that with you?

1022
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:50,066
Her Detox commercial I loved

1023
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,567
because it was very brave
and upfront

1024
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,734
and right out there.

1025
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,233
- This week,
I wasn't feeling her look.

1026
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,367
It looked a little homemade.

1027
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:00,600
- Jinkx Monsoon's Delusion.

1028
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,900
- She looked so beautiful
tonight.

1029
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,166
I was so very proud of her.

1030
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,567
- She had one of the best
commercials,

1031
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:10,834
but it felt very, like,
vaudeville-y.

1032
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,166
- All right, let's move on

1033
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:17,333
to Roxxxy Andrews'
Thick &amp; Juicy.

1034
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:20,133
- On the runway,
I wasn't in love with her look.

1035
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:22,066
She had a bit of an open back,

1036
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,133
but it wasn't cut out
nearly enough

1037
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,266
to save the front of that look.

1038
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,233
- The whole thing was tacky.

1039
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,500
The outfit tonight was tacky.

1040
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,867
The commercial was tacky.

1041
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,633
I-I can't.

1042
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,066
- [laughs]

1043
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,700
- [claps]
Silence.

1044
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,600
I've made my decision.

1045
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Bring back my girls.

1046
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,900
- [laughs]

1047
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,100
- [laughs]

1048
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,967
- Welcome back, ladies.

1049
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:52,900
I've made some decisions.

1050
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,066
Jinkx Monsoon.

1051
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:58,867
You're safe.

1052
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,934
Detox.

1053
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:05,066
You're safe.

1054
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:07,633
Alaska, this week, girl,

1055
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:11,066
you caused quite a stink.

1056
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:12,066
Condragulations.

1057
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,800
You're the winner
of this challenge.

1058
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,967
- Ha ha!

1059
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,800
- You've won a selection
of handcrafted corsets

1060
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,266
from corsetconnection.com.

1061
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:24,867
- [laughs]
I'm so happy.

1062
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,333
I can't say this win is overdue,

1063
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,533
but it's right on fucking time.

1064
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,967
- Ivy Winters.

1065
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,400
In your commercial,
your dress code

1066
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,900
was not strictly enforced.

1067
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,967
I'm sorry, my dear,

1068
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:43,633
but you are up for elimination.

1069
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,834
- I did not expect
to be lip-synching.

1070
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,867
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

1071
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,800
- Coco Montrese.

1072
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Safari, so goody.

1073
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,233
You're safe.

1074
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,400
- Thank you.

1075
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
- Alyssa Edwards, this week

1076
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,967
you were not as inspired
as we desired.

1077
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:06,367
Roxxxy Andrews,
your Thick &amp; Juicy

1078
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:11,100
was a bit too loosey-goosey.

1079
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,166
Roxxxy Andrews...

1080
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,633
you're safe.

1081
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,600
You may join the other girls.

1082
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,967
- Thank you.

1083
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,133
- Alyssa, I'm sorry, my dear,

1084
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,633
but you are up for elimination.

1085
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,467
- I'm disappointed, of course.

1086
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,800
I don't want to be known

1087
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,834
as being in the bottom
two times in a row.

1088
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,367
- Two queens stand before me.

1089
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,834
Ladies, this is your last chance

Obviously, I'm gonna be last.

Raven is jealous of anyone
that has talent.

232
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,734
- Ms. Sanchez.

00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,400

It'd be so easy to take you to

A little dewiness
just along the highlights.

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,867
Some of the other girls do it.

337
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,467
- I think it's because
the other girls' face get oily.

338
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,867
My face doesn't get oily
in drag.

339
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,066
- I do have oily skin.

You know the shapes
you're going for.

finessed and smoothed out.

00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,500
And it is--sometimes it gets
a little bit magic marker.

348
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,734
I recommend always building

349
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,800
all your contouring
into the base.

350
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,066
- This challenge
is gonna be tough,

351
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,934
because I have a point to prove.

352
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,500
That point is I don't deserve to

353
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,100
be in the bottom two again.

354
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,233

- Wow. Look at this.

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,834
I barely recognize this.

358
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,567
- Yeah, you said
you didn't want "off the rack,"

359
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,367
so I'm going way off the rack.

360
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,333
- Smart girl.

361
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,433
- You're super cute.

362
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,834
I think you could be
really beautiful.

363
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,433
Think Goldie Hawn, really.

364
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,266
Like--'cause see, she has, like,
a simple eye.

365
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,967
Lashy, softer, bigger
and really plump,

366
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,433
'cause you've got great eyes.

367
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,467
Play with that.

368
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,467
- Hi, Jessica.

369
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:39,867
Wow. Look at this.

370
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,200
- My wedding is going to be
an extravaganza.

371
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,300
- I love an extravaganza.

372
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,767
- Sometimes your face
worries me.

373
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,433
This is a problem.

374
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:51,166
Your highlights are so bright
here and here and here

375
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,433
that it looks as though
you have stubble.

376
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,867
Maybe it's about
putting the dark under

377
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,633
and then highlighting the jaw,

378
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:01,500
and really, there needs to be
a lot more blending.

379
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,567
- All right.

380
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,500
- Hi, Sahara.

381
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,800
- Hi, Ru.

382
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,166
- So tell me about your dress.

383
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,667
- I'm gonna cut it up
and make it shorter

384
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,367
and add some volume
to the bottom.

385
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,433
- Now that will go underneath?
- Yes.

386
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,800
- And you have enough fabric
here to support that?

387
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
- Uh, yes.

388
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,166
- And you're gonna pad?

389
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,400
- And I'm gonna pad, yeah.

390
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,233
- You've got
a lot of work to do.

391
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,333
- I do. I do.
- Yeah.

392
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,433
- You're so young in person.

393
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,467
- Ooh.

394
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,133
- She's a little old-looking.

395
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,567
Looking at your face now

396
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,233
and it doesn't have
the closed-in thing

397
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,667
that Sahara gets.

398
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,133
This thing always scares me
and this--

399
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,166
- How do I fix that?

400
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,300
- Try a little--something

401
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,066
that's just a little brighter
along there.

402
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,800
- All right.
- Thank you.

403
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,333
- Well, hello, Tati.

404
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,367
- Hello.

405
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,834
- Your makeup's
all over the shop.

406
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,300
It's all over the place,
and sometimes it's beautiful

407
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,333
and sometimes it's like,

408
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,734
"What the hell is she doing?"

409
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,600
But you're so beautiful,

410
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,967
and you don't have to be
overly draggy.

411
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,667
And there's girls
who have made a career

412
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,900
on being that beautiful.

413
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Just depends on what kind of
girl you want to be.

414
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,834
But don't rest on those laurels.

415
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,834
- No, definitely not.

416
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,867
- Thank you, Tatianna.

417
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,767
- Thank you.

418
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,467
- Juju.

419
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,500
- Hi, Ru.

420
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
- Wow.

421
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
I see jewels for Juju.

422
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,066
What do you call this color?

423
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,233
- Tawny sunset.

424
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,934
- Tawny sunset.

425
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,367
I love that.

426
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,433
- I'd like to see Jujubee's
version of natural makeup.

427
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,667
I use the Mariah Carey
reference.

428
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,066
And I don't want it
to be natural,

429
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,934
but I want to believe
that it's natural.

430
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,133
I want supernatural.

431
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,100
- Okay.

432
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,200
- That's your challenge.

433
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,867
- I will do it.

434
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,400
- Raven.

435
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,500
- Hello, hello.

436
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,066
- You won the mini challenge,

437
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,967
so you got to pick
your dress first.

438
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,266
- Yes.
- Are you happy with it?

439
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,200
- Yeah, I took
the whole thing up.

440
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,467
I started up here by pinning it
and hand sewing.

441
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:46,233
- So let's talk makeup.

442
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,567
- I would like
to see you introduce

443
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:50,066
a smidgen of color
into your makeup.

444
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,500
I can see that it's like, "Oh,

445
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,834
this person really knows their
way around their face."

446
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,500
But you could warm this up and

447
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,800
same with your jawline contour.

448
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,767
- Okay.

449
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,066
- Ladies!

450
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,500
Mathu and I will see you
tomorrow on the main stage.

451
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,934
And our extra-special
guest judge

452
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:08,433
will be one of
my musical heroes...

453
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,567
the legendary Martha Wash.

454
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,867
[applause]

455
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,300
- I'm so excited about
Martha Wash being a guest judge.

456
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,767
I have listened
to her music forever,

457
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,967
and I love her voice.

458
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,967
- Don't fuck it up.

459
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,967
See ya.

460
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,100
Come on, Mathu.

461
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,266
- Today we're shooting
our male half of the photo,

462
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,900
our groom side.

463
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
And then tomorrow
we're taking the bride.

464
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
We're gonna meld them together.

465
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,066
I'm excited to see
how it's going to look.

466
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,266
- There is slight anxiousness

467
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,266
because I'm not
the most masculine guy.

468
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,066
I never grow a beard.

469
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,300
I don't grow a mustache.

470
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,367
- You know, growing up,
I would sit there on the counter

471
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,100
and watch my mom do her makeup.

472
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,166
You know, I didn't really
watch my dad shave.

473
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,800
I was more interested in
the lipstick and eye shadow.

474
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,066
- You know, doing drag on top

475
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,700
of being gay, you know, at 14,

476
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,333
it was kind of an escape.

477
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,100
Like, I get to be someone else.

478
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,266
I get to be as feminine as I

479
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:03,300
want to be and then I don't get

480
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,867
pointed out for it...

481
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,600
um, or made fun of for it,

482
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,667
because a lot of people, you

483
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,066
know, didn't know I was a boy.

484
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,734
So this is gonna be just

485
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,066
completely different.

486
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,767
- When I did my makeup as a guy,

487
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,333
I knew I was the first one
in the mirror,

488
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,934
and so I went ahead

489
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,133
and I drew the facial hair on.

490
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,700
Then I look over and then

491
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,967
Sahara's drawing on
the facial hair,

492
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,633
then Pandora's drawing on
the facial hair

493
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,934
and Tatianna comes
and draws on the facial hair.

494
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,233
And it was pissing me off

495
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,066
because this is my hard work and

496
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,467
you're, like, stealing my idea.

497
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,700
So I'm hoping I go on the stage
first tomorrow.

498
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,500
That way, everyone that comes
behind me will look like,

499
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,266
"Oh, I got that from Tyra."

500
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,166
- Hello.

501
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,800
- Hi.
- Morgan.

502
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,233
- My name is Joe.
Nice to meet you.

503
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,266
- It's a pleasure.

504
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,600
- So we're gonna be creating an

505
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,567
illusion here today.

506
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,600
- Story of my life.

507
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,934
- Just imagine that there's

508
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,266
another person next to you.

509
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,667
Look right here.

510
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,467
One, two, three.

511
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,300
Yeah, big motion.
Yeah, that's great.

512
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,934
- My groom is a punk rocker.

513
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,233
He just probably
rolled out of bed

514
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,934
and threw on a leather jacket
and a tie

515
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:09,133
and came to the chapel.

516
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,333
- One, two, three.

517
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,100
- I do feel comfortable having

518
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,333
to perform as a male, but I have

519
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,300
a little more confidence when

520
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,333
I'm in drag.

521
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,600
I feel a lot more glamorous,

522
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,834
a lot more pretty.

523
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,100
- There's been such a focus on

524
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,233
the girl, the girl, the girl,

525
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,233
that when it was time to be a

526
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,734
boy, I was so stressed that I

527
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,500
was like, "Oh, my god,
it's time to be a boy."

528
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,166
So I had to just push that aside
for a second

529
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,867
and consider the direction
that I want to go.

530
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,233
- One, two, three.

531
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,066
[chuckles] Excellent.

532
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,867
Nice.

533
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,934
- I am smiling in my picture

534
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,767
because if I have
the opportunity

535
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,367
of being married
with Jessica Wild,

536
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,834
I am going to be happy.

537
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,166
- Two, three.

to see how they did?

718
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,133
all: Uh-huh.

719
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:25,467
- Gentlemen...
start your engines.

720
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:29,333
And may the best woman win!

721
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,166
Sahara, wow.

722
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,900
- Hold me closer, tiny dancer.

723
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,300
-<i> Swan Lake.</i>

724
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,967
- I've dreamed about having
a<i> Swan Lake</i><span style="bodyStyle"> wedding</i>

725
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,066
ever since I was young.

726
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,266
- Married in a tutu.

727
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:42,266
- It's tutu much.

728
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,834
- Morgan McMichaels.

729
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,967
<i>November Rain.</i>

730
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,600
She's serving a little
Pam Anderson there too.

731
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,166
- I start off like I'm bridal,

732
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,800
and then I start
throwing some sass into it,

733
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,400
and you know,
it's supermodel-esque.

734
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,166
- I'd like to sit on her
loveseat.

735
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,633
- That's the Lacroix--

736
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,633
- Lacroix, the pouf.

737
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,667
Absolutely.

738
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,066
- More cushion for the pushin'.

739
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:02,834
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

740
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,066
Oh!

741
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,333
- I feel great.

742
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,266
My dress looks amazing.

743
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,834
- It's daddy's little girl.

744
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,900
He's paying for everything.

745
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,367
Raven!

746
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,333
She's been hitched, look!

747
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,467
- My dress looked amazing.

748
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:20,934
I felt like a cupcake.

749
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,133
I felt very cute.

750
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,467
- Look at that nice little line
of bow detail.

751
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,867
- Paris gets married.

752
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:27,467
- It is very Paris, isn't it?

753
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:28,533
Paris Hilton.

754
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,767
Jessica Wild...

755
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,066
- My darling,
you do take a hint or two.

756
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,400
- She did your makeup.

757
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,767
- Makeup's a lot better.

758
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:36,967
- It's my wedding.

759
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:40,400
And the makeup
helped me with the total look.

760
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,166
- Look at our daughter!

761
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,867
Our little girl's all grown up.

762
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,667
Tatianna.

763
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,367
Look at that keyhole
by her no-no hole.

764
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,200
- I liked my dress; then
I hated it at the same time.

765
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
But I was still proud of myself

766
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,967
that I did something with it.

767
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,400
- She's a voluptuous bride.

768
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,433
The implants took.

769
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,734
- Yes, they did.

770
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:01,266
Pandora Boxx,
oh, wow, look at that.

771
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,467
- Very romantic.

772
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,734
- I wanted to come across
as a very pretty bride

773
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:07,467
that's very excited
to get married,

774
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,066
and just very demure.

775
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,200
- Very innocent eyes.

776
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,433
- Oh, she did the thing
with the makeup too!

777
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,467
- I'm well pleased.

778
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,433
Like a gorgeous endive salad,

779
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,900
crisp and delicious.

780
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
- [gasps]

781
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,266
Is this our Jujubee?

782
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,066
- The gown fits very nicely.

783
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,700
- I want them to see the full
package,

784
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,367
so I'm going to go slowly.

785
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:24,834
And I'm going to be
very elegant.

786
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,133
And I want you to see
every single angle.

787
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,133
- Look at the back.

788
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,066
Oh, that's beautiful.

789
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,734
- Now instead of
a pearl necklace,

790
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,367
she went for the pearl
down the back.

791
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,633
Oh, yes.

792
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:39,166
Hello, my blushing brides.

793
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,633
It's time to unveil
your wedding portraits.

794
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,066
Jujubee.

795
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,567
Oh.

796
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,300
What a cute couple.

797
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,066
- I hope you didn't sign
that prenup.

798
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,934
- Honey, he's rich.

799
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,066
- In the picture,
she's not really into the groom.

800
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,433
But I think somehow it works.

801
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,133
- Even though
there's a man in that picture,

802
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,767
it's still sort of
all about her.

803
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,633
- She's a man-eater.
- [laughing]

804
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,834
Thank you, Jujubee.
- Thank you.

805
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,166
- Jessica Wild.

806
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,900
Oh, my goodness!

807
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,967
You've got yourself a hot one,
honey.

808
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,100
- They really
make a cute couple.

809
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,266
- They really are cute.

810
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:15,100
- The dress I like
except for the piece on the top.

811
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,800
- She's wearing her veil
on her shoulder.

812
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
- I could see that you love to
go for the big

813
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
and the layers and the ruffles,

814
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,867
but I want it to go away.

815
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,600
I just want to see you.

816
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
- Pandora Boxx.

817
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,834
You seem a little tentative.

818
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,333
- I'm scared
of my first marriage.

819
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,400
It was either the option of

820
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
going to jail
or getting married.

821
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
- Oh, I see.

822
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
- Just doesn't do anything
for me.

823
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,867
- Really?
- No.

824
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:35,800
Marriage, going to jail.

825
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,834
Maybe I'd do the time
for a while.

826
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:38,800
- [laughs]

827
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,867
- There's a lot of backstory

828
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,066
that I can read
into this picture.

829
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,767
Adds a lot of comedy to it.

830
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:47,066
- I'm kind of having an organza
orgasm over this dress.

831
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,934
- Oh, really cool.
- I love organza.

832
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,266
- Can we get a napkin over here?

833
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,600
- [laughs]

834
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,867
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

835
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,767
Is that R. Kelly?

836
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,433
And she looks like Donna Summer
in that picture right there.

837
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,133
- You look like a porcelain doll
with the makeup.

838
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,066
- Thank you.
- I love it.

839
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:04,066
- Huge bouquet, Tyra.

840
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,100
- The huge bouquet is because

841
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,533
it comes from
my last husband's funeral.

842
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,767
- Oh, okay.

843
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,066
- I love how big
your bouquet is.

844
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:15,066
I love the whole shape
and silhouette of your dress.

845
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,734
You were this close
to being bridezilla,

846
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:19,367
but you are perfection.

847
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,500
- What blows me away is that

848
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,066
you added this little...lace?

849
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:25,633
- I hot-glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.

850
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,967
- You're gonna have to
take a flame torch

851
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,467
to get that off of
there.

852
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,400
- You're like an old-school
drag queen,

853
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,834
but fresh and new to us.

854
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:32,867
- Thank you.

855
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:34,433
- Hi, Tatianna.

856
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,400
- Hello.

857
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,967
- Ooh. He's hot.

858
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,400
He's gorgeous.

859
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,667
Thug love, baby.

860
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,700
- You're really fortunate
to have immunity this week

861
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,166
because I hate this dress.

862
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,867
- The face is so killer that

863
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,066
you want the clothes
to live up to it.

864
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,734
- Mathu, is this a "xana-do"
or a "xana-don't"?

865
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:54,967
- It's a xana-don't.

866
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,533
- Sahara Davenport.

867
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,300
- I remember being a little boy

868
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,600
who dreams
of a fairy-tale wedding,

869
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,367
like<i> Swan Lake</i>
or something very ethereal.

870
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:07,767
- I thought the presentation
was fabulous.

871
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:08,867
I loved it.

872
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,834
Dress I'm not so sure about.

873
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:11,900
- When you're not<i> en pointe,</i>

874
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,533
it's not a good look.

875
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,900
It looks a little crafty
and homemade,

876
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,734
and the fit is off.

877
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,767
- Raven.

878
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:20,967
Oh, how cute.

879
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,100
He looks older than--

880
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,734
- He's 36.

881
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,333
- He's 36 and you're 16?

882
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,433
- Going on 16.

883
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,533
- Ooh!
- Oh, I see.

884
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,967
- [laughing]

885
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,300
- What--okay,
then you're jailbait.

886
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,433
- She's jailbait.

887
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,633
- She's jailbait.
- She's jailbait.

888
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,800
- Love that.

889
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Love your turquoise accents,
love the bows.

890
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,633
You have the most expensive
looking dress up here.

891
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:43,867
- It's kind of like this fluffy,
girly, flirty dress,

892
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,967
but she's still packing a wallop
somewhere.

893
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,066
- It's under the skirt.

894
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,066
- Yes!

895
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,734
[all laugh]

896
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,700
- Morgan McMichaels.

897
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,633
She's a punk dude.

898
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,800
- I'm not sure
about the punk look.

899
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,300
- It's neither here nor there
for me.

900
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,567
I'm not crazy for it.

901
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,467
- It's more of a costume versus
a wedding gown.

902
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,767
I'm just not loving the shape
overall.

903
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:08,100
- You know, white pumps
are the sign of a true hooker.

904
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,734
And I love you for that.

905
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,066
Tonight's gonna be more
difficult than I thought.

906
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,066
And I need your help.

907
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:18,333
What are the judges not seeing
on the main stage

908
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,066
that we need to know?

909
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:22,433
Tatianna?

910
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,533
- Um, I don't think
that you're seeing

911
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:28,567
that Tyra's a complete bitch.

912
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,633
- That was frank.

913
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,633
- Thank you.

914
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,367
She has this diva attitude,

915
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:35,066
like I am America's sweetheart.

916
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,266
But she's not.

917
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,467
- I completely agree
with what Tatianna says.

918
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,567
I don't think that the face
that you see of Tyra

919
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,100
is what we're seeing backstage.

920
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,433
Everyone asked Tyra to be quiet

921
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:46,734
and not sing obnoxiously loud
for an hour.

922
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,633
<i>- ♪ Aah, ooh-ooh ♪</i>

923
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:51,066
- I asked her to stop nicely.

924
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:53,066
And she was like, "okay."

925
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,100
And then I walk across the room,

926
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,567
and it's like lah, lah,
lah-ah-ah-ah.

927
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,467
-<i> ♪ La ♪</i>

928
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,066
- She was almost saying,
"Shut the fuck up,

929
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,333
or I'll make you shut up."

930
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,266
It, like, really,
really pissed me off,

931
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,600
'cause she talks so much shit

932
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,967
about so many people
but won't say it to their face.

933
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,800
- You really
shouldn't play the victim.

934
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
It doesn't suit you.

935
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,533
You don't do it well.

936
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,767
- I was not doing that to make
anyone upset

937
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,500
or, like, make anyone unfocused.

938
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,467
- Bullshit.

939
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,667
- Then maybe next time
I will sing,

940
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,100
and maybe she'll get
another horrible dress

941
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,934
like she has on now.

942
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:23,066
- Tyra, do you think this really

943
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,300
has to do with the music
or something else?

944
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,066
- They're testing me.
- Mm-hmm.

945
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,967
- And it's like, kind of
pissing me off.

946
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,900
Morgan, do you think
I'm a bitch?

947
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,967
- No, I think you have a goal.

948
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,633
- Raven, do you think
I'm a bitch?

949
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:34,633
- No.

950
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,734
Sahara, do you think
I'm a bitch?

951
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,066
- I think sometimes
you're selfish.

952
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,066
- I think you need manners,
girl.

953
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,433
- Just because I--
when you give me a compliment

954
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:42,533
I don't give you one back

955
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,734
doesn't mean
I don't have manners.

956
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,066
- Girl, I know I'm gorgeous.

957
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:47,066
You don't need to tell me
anything, miss thing.

958
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,066
Just get yourself some manners

959
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,533
so you won't look
so damn stupid.

960
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,567
- [laughs]

961
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,400
- We're gonna move beyond this.

962
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,300
I think this is
another challenge

963
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,900
that we will all
have to overcome.

964
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,066
And we'll have to take it
into account.

965
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:06,800
Just promise me
we will be queens.

966
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,900
Now, while you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

967
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,367
the judges and I
will deliberate.

968
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,934
You may leave the stage.

969
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,300
Let's start with Jujubee.

970
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,767
- I'm a huge Jujubee fan.

971
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:22,233
She comes out here,
she works the runway,

972
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,500
her style choices are always
very nudge-nudge, wink-wink.

973
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,800
It's charming.

974
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,834
- I think the dress
drowned her out a little bit.

975
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,233
You know, there was a lot
going on.

976
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:34,333
- I told Jujubee last week
to turn up the fire.

977
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,467
And I'm not sure

978
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,834
if she's turned it up
to full capacity.

979
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,433
Jessica Wild.

980
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,066
Now, I liked the dress because

981
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,066
it actually works for her.

982
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:44,400
- I didn't like the top part.

983
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,867
- The fan thing? Yeah.

984
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,533
- It was very<i> quinceañera.</i>

985
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,800
I think her style is pretty bad.

986
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,500
- Mathu, she did take your
pointers with the makeup.

987
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,934
- And I am well impressed that
she did do it.

988
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,433
She didn't have the heavy brow.

989
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,300
- Right.
- And she took her bang away.

990
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,600
- That's right.

991
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,734
- Pandora Boxx.

992
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,266
Now, Martha,
you did not like her dress.

993
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,767
- It didn't do a thing for her.

994
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:09,967
She just dissolved
into that dress.

995
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,433
- She went for a whole other
persona, this kind of--

996
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,367
- She took a chance.
- Bridal realness.

997
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,533
I thought it was a full show.

998
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,700
- My problem with
Miss Pandora Boxx all along

999
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,500
is it's like, um, blah.

1000
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,066
Like all of her fashion
choices--

1001
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:24,633
It's not even like, "they're
hideous; they're horrible"

1002
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:27,100
as it's like, "Eh;
there you are."

1003
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,700
- Miss Tyra "boom boom" Sanchez.

1004
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
She's a showgirl.

1005
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,066
She's the one your eyes go to.

1006
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,667
- I was blown away.

1007
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,166
- For Tyra, the biggest problem
is what?

1008
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,767
- All the girls hate her.

1009
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,367
- I think
she's a great performer.

1010
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,767
I don't feel
a lot of warmth from her.

1011
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,266
- Her attitude sucks.

1012
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,433
And if it was up to me,

1013
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,467
I'd vote her off right now.

1014
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,533
- Tatianna.

1015
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,266
If she did not have
immunity this week,

1016
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,200
she would be in the bottom two.

1017
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
- Hello.
- Yes.

1018
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
- Tatianna gets the beautiful
thing a lot.

1019
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,066
- Yeah.

1020
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,600
- But she gets the ugly dress
thing a lot too.

1021
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,900
She gets the ugly dress thing
a lot.

1022
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,567
She's gotten that
more than once.

1023
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,600
- Sahara.

1024
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,133
Did not like her dress.

1025
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,200
- Skimpy tutu.

1026
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,500
- It wasn't enough tulle.

1027
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,533
I mean, for drag,
you have to exaggerate things.

1028
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,533
- Sahara was a little dry.

1029
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,367
- Yeah, she was a little dry.

1030
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,533
Raven.

1031
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,600
I loved Raven's outfit.

1032
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,133
- She was the other standout.

1033
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,834
- She was the other standout.

1034
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,066
Love the bows.

1035
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:21,066
- I was loving her<i> Elle</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bride</i>
blue shoe.

1036
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,700
- Morgan McMichaels.

1037
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,166
I have to say
I did not like her dress.

1038
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,967
- A pouf skirt
is kind of hard to pull off.

1039
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,567
- She never does
serious fashion.

1040
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:29,900
She always does costume.

1041
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,400
- Did Morgan improve her makeup?

1042
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,266
- She's still doing
her signature Morgan look,

1043
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,500
but it didn't look magic marker
this time.

1044
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,200
- [claps]
Silence.

1045
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,533
I've made my decision.

1046
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,800
Bring the girls back.

1047
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,133
Ladies.

1048
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,834
As we witnessed here tonight,

1049
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,133
tensions are running high.

1050
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:52,233
I will not tolerate problems

1051
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,900
between my girls.

1052
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,066
We are all in this together.

1053
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,567
Now, based on the wedding
challenge

1054
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:05,266
and your presentation
on the main stage tonight,

1055
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,100
I've made some decisions.

1056
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,600
Jujubee.

1057
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,834
Today in that dress,
you owned everything.

1058
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:13,867
You're safe.

1059
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,066
- Thank you.

1060
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,300
- Jessica.

1061
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,600
<i>Mucho escandalo.</i>

1062
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,066
You are safe.

1063
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,233
Tyra Sanchez.

1064
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:31,200
This week, you raised the bar
on this competition.

1065
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,734
Again.

1066
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:38,900
Please do not
lower its standards.

1067
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,233
- I'm scared that Ru is going

1068
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:43,867
to look at me and say,
"Tyra Sanchez,

1069
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,533
you are in the bottom two."

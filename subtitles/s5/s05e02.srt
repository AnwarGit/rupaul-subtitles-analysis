immediately pick you?

very, like, hard on her.

355
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:30,066
- Um, well, she doesn't really
move very much.

356
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,233
- She would still
have character.

357
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,633
Bring it up.
- Bring it up. I can do it.

358
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,066
I can do it. I can do it.
- Y'all make it work, okay?

359
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,900
See you later. All right.
- Thank you.

360
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,633
- Just make up a character,
honey.

361
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,467
Make up a something.

362
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,467
- Team Detox.
- Hi, Ru.

363
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:46,066
- Now, I know you're doing
season four.

364
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,433
Who's playing Sharon?

365
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,667
Who's playing Phi Phi?

366
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,934
- Phi phi.
- Duh.

367
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:51,934
- You're Phi Phi?
[laughs]

368
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,500
And you're Sharon?
- Yeah.

369
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,867
- It's interesting.
You live with Sharon.

370
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,266
Why didn't you play Sharon?

371
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,333
- I do Sharon all the time.

372
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,734
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

373
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,734
Now, who are you two?
- Ms. Jiggly Caliente.

374
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:04,433
- Jiggly Caliente.

375
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,500
- I'm Lashauwn Beyond.
- Lashauwn Beyond.

376
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,133
- Yes.
- What is the key to doing this?

377
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,633
Have you ever done spoken word?

378
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,567
- Not that much.

379
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,400
- What's the biggest challenge
with this scene?

380
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,266
- Honest, just listening to
Phi Phi's voice over and over.

381
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,066
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,533
- Well, I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.

383
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,100
- All right, Ru.
- And make it special.

384
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,834
- Okay.
- Thank you, Ru.

385
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,500
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi, Ru.

386
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,834
- So you're doing season two.
- Yes.

387
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,300
- And who are you playing?
- I'm playing Morgan.

388
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,633
- And who are you playing?
- Tatianna.

389
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,700
- Tatianna, of course.
- Yes.

390
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,867
- And you are?
- Mystique Summers.

391
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,867
- Mystique Summers Madison.

392
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,667
I wanted to call her
Mystique Summers eve.

393
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,066
But she wasn't having it.

394
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,867
Okay, who are you?

395
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,433
- Tyra Sanchez.

396
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,066
- You're the other, other Tyra.

397
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,233
Can we hear a little bit
of Tyra and Tatianna?

398
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,433
- Sure.

399
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,400
- Tapped me on the shoulder.

400
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,734
- I tapped you on the elbow
first.

401
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,600
- If it bothered anyone,
if they would have just said,

402
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,900
"Could you keep it down?
It's bothering me,"

403
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,100
that had would've been fine.

404
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,500
- And I did that.
- If someone comes to you...

405
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
- [laughs]

406
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
- And saying you're obnoxious--

407
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,266
- I'm watching you lip-synch.
- Ah, okay.

408
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,700
- That's not how I started it,
though.

409
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,734
I tapped you on the shoulder.

410
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:17,467
First I-I said your name
across the room.

411
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,600
- Okay, well, you got a lot
of work to do.

412
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,066
Get at it.
- Thank you, Ru.

413
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,066
- All right, see ya.
- Mwah.

414
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,633
- All right, dolls.

415
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:29,367
Now, I warned you this is gonna
be a lip-synch extravaganza.

416
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,600
Read my lips.

417
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,333
[silent]

418
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,600
[laughter and applause]

419
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,834
- Queens: Bye.
- Bye, Ru.

[hip-hop music]

421
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,233
- Oh.

422
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,667
My train, girl, my train.

423
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,967
Our challenge this week
is to lip-synch

424
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,800
to a past scene from<i> Untucked.</i>

425
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Where do you want me to be?
- Mimi over here, then.

426
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,934
- My team had to do scenes from
season three.

427
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:59,066
It's Shangela, Mimi Imfurst,
and Mariah.

428
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,700
- Boo, just 'cause you got
a sugar daddy

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,166
who pays for everything
for you--

- Bitch!
- Oh!

431

- Hey, hey.
- No, no, no, no.

432
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,266
- Okay, ready?

- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no. No.

- Oh, my gosh. Watch out.

Watch out, watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out, watch out.

- Graceful.

- Oh!

- [laughing]

444
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,166
- Do it again.
Do it again.

445
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,667
- Can I have just one second
to get this back on?

446
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,867
- Here.
- Just get it for her fast.

447
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,533

- Do it again.

- I will never look like that.
- True.

[dramatic music]

452
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,367
- Do it again.

453
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,266
- It is easier for you to say,
"Do it again," okay?

454
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:50,600
- Hold on.
- Can I have a second?

455
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,266
- Oh, but you want to
really fight.

456
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:57,300
- It got to the point where
I had to yell and scream

457
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,700
and snap at people
just to be heard in that group.

458
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,467
[choked up]
And this is too important to me

459
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:07,967
to let them get to me like this.

460
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,166
-<i> Coming up...</i>

461
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,667
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.

462
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,233
- That would take the lose away.

463
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,300
- Honey, you are already out.

464
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,200
- I'm really starting
to get annoyed.

465
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,400
- [laughs]

466
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,133
- [laughs]

467
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,433
- Our challenge today is

468
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,934
we have to lip-synch
from a past season.

469
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,300
The second scene is with myself
and Serena.

470
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,667
We're playing Delta and Raja.

471
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,300
- Like,
it's like a soccer player

472
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,467
from, like, Paraguay
or something,

473
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,567
mixed with, like, Afghanistan
and<i> Charro.</i>

474
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,967
- I wonder if people
talk about us this way.

475
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,166
- At the end,
when you hear,

476
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,066
"I wonder if they talk about us
this way,"

477
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,667
you turn to us like you just
heard the entire conversation

478
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,667
or whatever.

479
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,734
- Okay.
- Then I'll just pass out.

480
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:52,400
I come from
an arts school environment,

481
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,467
and I believe that drag
is performing gender

482
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:58,500
through various skills, like
makeup as a form of painting,

483
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,934
fashion as a form
of self-sculpture,

484
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:03,066
and showmanship
through performance.

485
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,667
- I wonder if people talk
about us this way.

486
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,667
[coughs]

487
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:15,166
- Serena playing Raja...

488
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,734
that was really bizarre.

489
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,934
- All right.

490
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:22,100
How'd you guys feel about that?

491
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,066
I feel good.
[clapping]

492
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,133
How did you guys feel?

493
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,734
- Oh, my God.

494
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:30,467
We're so gonna be on the bottom
because of you.

495
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,800
- All right, ladies.

496
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
- All right.

497
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
The first scene that
my team is performing

498
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,333
is a catfight between
Morgan McMichaels

499
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,066
and Mystique Summers
from season two.

500
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,467
- Go fix your hair.
- I don't need some--

501
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,500
- Fix your mug.

502
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch.

503
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,266
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.

504
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,700
- Sweetie. Sweetie.
- You do need to--

505
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,667
- I don't gotta hit your ass

506
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,433
to probably get voted off,
bitch.

507
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:51,900
- Hit me. Do it.
- Walk off. Step off, bitch.

508
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,834
- Do it.

509
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,633
- Lineysha's acting crazy.

510
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,066
- Okay, let's do it again.

511
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,467
- We should be working
as a team,

512
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,467
and she's goofing off
and playing around.

513
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,567
- Don't be, like, banging

514
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,834
'cause the argument's
mainly about

515
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,834
what Morgan and Mystique
are saying.

516
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,066
- Hit me.

517
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,633
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.

518
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,767
- That will take the lose away.

519
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,066
- Honey, you are out. Lost.

520
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,734
- That will take the lose away.
- You already lost.

521
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,800
- I think Lineysha wants
all the eyes on her,

522
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,967
and I'm really starting
to get annoyed.

523
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,867
- Ooh.

524
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,500
- I'm playing Tatianna

525
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,834
in a scene where
Tatianna and Tyra are bickering

526
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,066
back and forth.

I don't like you.

00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,066
- And I don't like you.
Are you happy?

529
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,667
I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.

530
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:38,967
- I'm saying it to your face.

531
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,166
Then why are you looking
in my direction?

532
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,133
- Ugh.

533
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,166

538
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,266
Lineysha was the worst person
to work with,

539
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,266
but her performance as Tyra
was awesome.

540
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,300
She was so on point.

541
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
Um, she's one
to be reckoned with.

542
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,367
- Okay.

543
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,467

to reenact from season four,

544
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:09,834
one of which is between Phi Phi
O'Hara and Sharon Needles.

545
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,467
- Do you really think I'm upset
that I didn't get a cruise?

546
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,066
- The only thing
you keep saying is,

547
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,333
"I promised Alaska one thing,

548
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,500
"and that was to bring her back
a trip.

549
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
[whiny voice]
Why didn't I get a cruise?"

550
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,767
- I will say that
I really wanted a cruise,

551
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,834
but I wanted the $100,000 more.

552
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,066
And look. Guess what.

553
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,600
We got both.
[laughs]

554

and that was to bring her back

558
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,367
- I'm doing an okay job,
but luckily,

559
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,066
Phi Phi does this a lot,

560
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,567
so I can do that
to cover the fact

561
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,367
that I don't know what
she's saying.

562
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,500
- It's bullshit.

563
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,433
- No, you're bullshit.

- Hell, yeah. That was fun.

566
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,600
- Our second scene is between
Jiggly and Lashauwn.

- Of course, I get to be

571
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,667
who has a little bit of problem
with her makeup.

574
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,834
And then Monica
got to be Jiggly--

575
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,000
after the weight loss.

576
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,900

then shut the fuck up.

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,967
- I didn't say anything about
you going on the runway,

579
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,066
looking like that.

580
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,100
I said nothing about your look.

581
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,400
- Okay, really quick,
Monica,

582
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,266
you're fumbling a little bit

583

so when you're doing that,
just act up.

- Okay.

585

- If you lacking one thing...
- [muttering lines]

00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,600
- Somebody else ain't lacking,
then shut the fuck up.

587
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,100
- Monica started
to talk her lines,

588
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
when we're supposed to be
lip-synching.

589
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,667
It kind of threw me off
a little bit.

590
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,400
I felt like I was just
letting you have it

591
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,033
'cause you didn't throw it back
at me.

- I'm like, "Ugh,

597
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,233
I'm not focused, and I don't
have my 100% in this competition

598
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,500
because I have so much going on
in my head.

599
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,333
- I feel like Monica
gets a little bit nervous,

600
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,166
so I'm hoping that
she shakes out of that.

- Ding-dong!

604
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,300

on elimination day.

605

606

- We won't be in the bottom.
I promise.

607
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,100
- We're sort of looking
around the room

608
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,500
to see who's gonna be on
the chopping block.

609
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,867
- Something's a little different
with Monica.

610

I'm not sure exactly what it is,

611

616
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:47,333
I'm petrified to tell these

I don't know how they're gonna
take it.

It is hard being here.

619

- Listen, you're here

00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:59,133
You could tell inside

- Serena Chacha,
representing Panama.

700
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,633
- That's it.

701
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,734
- You can't even fit that
through the Panama Canal.

702
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,600
- Walking around
in this carnival costume

703
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,100
from the Republic of Panama
is a dream come true.

704
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,433
- Pants-off dance-off.

705
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,800
- [laughing]
Yeah.

706
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,066
- Jade Jolie.

707
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,567
It's the missing Ringling
sister.

708
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,800
- Screw the rainbows.
Give me leather.

709
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,700
- I'm serving up real
lion tamin' realness.

710
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,433
Bitch, send in the clowns.

711
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,633
- [laughs]

712
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,767
- Our little Jade
is all grown up.

713
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,500
Roxxxy Andrews.

714
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,467
If Cher had breastfed,

715
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,767
this is what she'd look like.

716
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:32,433
- I like to have the fringe
going down my boobicles

717
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:36,333
and on my booty and want to try
and win two times in a row.

718
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,266
- Tita Turtur.
- Turtur.

719
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:40,300

720
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,233
- [laughs]

721
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,567
- Jinkx Monsoon.

722
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,066
Hollywood glamour.

723
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,633
- Meets space.

724
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,633
- I am serving up
Hollywood 3012,

725
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,133
space-agey and beautiful.

726
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,100
- Very<i> 3rd Rock From the Sun.</i>

727
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,867
- Yes!

728
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,367
- Monica Beverly Hillz.

729
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,433
- Oh, yeah.

730
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,100
- Can you pay
my telephone bills?

731
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
- [laughs]

732
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,900
- My moneymaker is my face.

733
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,767
I know for a fact
that I'm beautiful.

734
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,133
- That is a nice ass.

735
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,433
- And it's not padded.

736
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:12,233
Natural-born thriller.

737
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,767
Alaska.

738
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,066
The 49th state.

739
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,967
- I'm trying to give sass
and flirt

740
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:22,667
and be cute
and sell this garment, sweetie.

741
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,633
- Party girl on her way home.

742
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,667
- Oops, I left my phone inside.

743
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,400
- Coco Montrese.

744
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,133
- This is Patti Labelle
meets Ziggy Stardust.

745
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

746
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,200
- I love fetish,
so I thought I'd give Santino

747
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,266
a little bit of something to
dream about tonight

748
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,300
while he's at home.

749
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,967
- You better "ass" somebody.

750
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,266
- Damn, girl.

751
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,400
Detox.

752
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,633
- Ohh.

753
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,867
- Snow White and the hunty man.

754
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:53,066
- Tonight I am wearing
an over-the-top gown

755
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,500
and feeling really sickening.

756
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,900
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?

757
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,667
- [guffaws]

758
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,567
[laughing]

759
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,367
- Welcome, ladies.

760
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,200
Let's take a look
at your viral videos.

761
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,800
First up,
team Serena Chacha.

762
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,333
In the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

763
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:17,467
Shangela and Mariah
confronted Mimi Imfurst.

764
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,900
- You told them
you could do glamour

765
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,066
and you were high-fashion.

766
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,667
Do you feel that you delivered
that today?

767
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,867
That's the question.

768
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:25,467
- No, but I don't think
that was the challenge.

769
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:27,233
- Don't tiptoe
around the answer.

770
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,166
The thing is,
you just told us

771
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,066
that what you do is camp.

772
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,734
- You'll never be glamour.

773
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,266
- Boo, just 'cause
you got a sugar daddy

774
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,066
who pays for everything
for you--

775
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,200
- Ooh!

776
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,500
- I've never had a sugar daddy.

777
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,567
If I wanted a sugar daddy,

778
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:40,800
yes, I probably could go out
and get one,

779
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,967
because I am what?

780
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,200
Sickening, bitch!

781
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,700
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no.

782
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,867
[laughter]

783
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,166
- Meanwhile, in the bar,

784
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,266
Delta gossiped with Raja.

785
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,834
- Manila was just that,
like, amalgamation

786
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,800
of every Asian stereotype.

787
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,967
- She was, like, Chinese,
Japanese,

788
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,066
dirty knees,
look at these.

789
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,166
Remember that?

790
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,767
- Right, like,
she's like a place in France

791
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,200
where the naked ladies dance.

792
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,867
- She was Cambodi-China-no.

793
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:07,133
- She was, like,
middle-America's interpretation

794
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,800
of Asian people, but when they
call them Oriental.

795
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
- [laughs]

796
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,967
I wonder if people talk about us
this way.

797
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:14,867
[coughs]

798
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,667
- All right.
[applause]

799
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:17,667
- Watching Serena was like

800
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,800
watching an old Chinese movie.

801
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,166
[silent]

802
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,300
- Next up, team Ivy Winters.

803
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,500
In the gold bar,
Tyra defended her singing,

804
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,667
which infuriated Tatianna.

805
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,700
- I'm not gonna replay it

806
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,734
because I already know
what happened,

807
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:35,066
and you already know
what happened.

808
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,433
- Okay, well, then--then
there's nothing else to say.

809
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:37,734
- I'm not replaying it with you
over and over again.

810
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:38,800
There isn't anything else
to say.

811
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,066
- But why are you talking?

812
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,467
- Why are<i> you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talking?</i>

813
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,367
- Anyway, if you have a problem
with someone, address it.

814
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,667
And that's probably why
I seem like a bitch.

815
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,500
If I don't like you,
I don't like you.

816
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,633
- And I don't like you.

817
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,133
Are you happy?
I don't like you.

818
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,433
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.

819
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,900
Then why are you looking
in my direction?

820
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,800
[laughter]

821
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,133
- Back in the lounge,

822
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:06,567
things were getting heated
between Morgan and Mystique.

823
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:07,533
- Go fix your hair.

824
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,900
- I don't need to.
- Fix your mug.

825
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,433
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch!

826
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:11,800
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.

827
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
- Sweetie.
- You have no manners.

828
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,734
- How do I have no--no manners?

829
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:15,967
- No class and no manners.

830
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,266
- No class, no manners?

831
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,367
You piss me off some more,

832
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,600
I will whoop your fucking ass.

833
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,633
Bitch, I am from Chicago.

834
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,734
[laughter and applause]

835
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,066
- I'm actually super confident

836
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,467
that I'm gonna be the winner
of the challenge

837
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,333
because I feel like
I turned it out.

838
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,834
- Next up, team Detox.

839
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,433
In the gold bar,

840
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,900
Jiggly was mad at Lashauwn.

841
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,967
- I'm not here to make
best buddies, bitch!

842
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:41,934
- Neither am I.

843
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,100
- I'm not here
to be your friend.

844
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,066
Then shut the fuck up!

845
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,934
You been everybody's B.F.F.

846
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,233
and ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki.
No.

847
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,667
- Clearly, I don't get along
with you.

848
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,633
- That's fine.
I don't have to be your friend.

849
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,767
This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>

850
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,767
- No shit, Sherlock.

851
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,333
- Back in the lounge,

852
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,734
Sharon defended herself

853
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,967
for calling Phi Phi O'Hara
cutthroat.

854
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,300
- I wasn't tarnishing your--
- Bullshit.

855
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,500
- I said you were cutthroat

856
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,200
and you hogged that
choreography, which is true.

857
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
- Because I'm fucking fierce,
and I'm good at what I do?

858
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
- No, you're the one
that fucking lied,

859
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,400
saying I'm just here for a trip.

860
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,233
We all know that's a joke.
- Bullshit.

861
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:16,400
Every fucking time.

862
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,567
It's bullshit.

863
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,667
- No, you're bullshit.

864
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,133
[laughter and applause]

865
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,900
- Oh, my lord.

866
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,467
- Ladies, you all did
an amazing job.

867
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:38,400
But one group was more
in synch than the others.

868
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,000
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...

- Alaska.

1056
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,567
- Her Phi Phi was fantastic.

1057
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:22,533
- I actually think her
performance really failed.

1058
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,200
I thought it was over the top
in not a funny way.

1059
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,233
- Coco Montrese.

1060
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:30,233
- She is such a badass.

The lip-synching she had down
to a tee.

1062
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:35,867
- Her Lashauwn was beyond
Lashauwn.

1063
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,467
- Detox.

1064
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,967
- Flawless and beautiful.

1065
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,367
- It just didn't do it for me.

1066
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,367
She didn't do it for me.

Monica,
your performance this week

1087
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,967
was a little too Jiggly
and not enough caliente.

1088
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:30,066
And, Serena,
as team leader,

1089
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:34,100
you forgot to cover
your own ass.

I'm sorry, my dears, but you are
both up for elimination.

1094
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,967
that I was gonna be
on the bottom two.

something earlier.

1096

Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me,

from elimination.

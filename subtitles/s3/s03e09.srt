179
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,333
- Ladies, all of your designs
were truly bodacious.

180
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,533
<i>But I can only choose one.</i>

181
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,467
So cross my heart,

182
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,333
the winner is...

183
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,600
[suspenseful music]

184
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
Manila.

185
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,867
- Whoo!

186
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,133
<i>Yes!</i>

187
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,934
- Why, those are the fastest
tits in the west.

188
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,100
- [exhales sharply]

189
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,767
- Now, I told you this week was

190
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:09,066
all about my two favorite
things--"t" and "a."

191
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,300
The "t" was for ta-tas,

192
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,800
but the "a" is for...

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,066
America.

194
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,633
- Ohh!
-<i> Yes.</i>

195
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:22,333
There is no place like
the U.S. of A.

196
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,133
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>

197
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:27,900
you'll each create a public
service announcement

198
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,734
entitled
"Why I love the U.S.A."

199
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,233
So the message should be
entertaining and from the heart,

200
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:39,300
because we'll be sending your
P.S.A.s

201
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,867
<i>to the brave men and women</i>

202
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,567
<i>who are serving our</i>
<i>country overseas.</i>

203
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,266
You'll each have ten minutes
in front of the camera,

204
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,066
and, Manila, since you won
the mini challenge,

205
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,066
you'll get an extra
five minutes.

206
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,900
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

207
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,100
start your engines.

208
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,934
And may the best American woman
win.

209
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,700
- It just kind of needs to be a
few words, right?

210
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
- Yeah, I'm doing, like,
snippets.

211
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,500
-<i> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking</i>
<i>of.</i>

212
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>When it came time for me</i>
<i>to write my P.S.A.,</i>

213
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,734
I had to think about what
American values

214
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,400
do I cherish the most?

215
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,734
If it's too speech-y...

216
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,800
it's only supposed to be 30
to 60 seconds long,

217
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
<i>so you have to kind of fill it</i>
<i>in</i>

218
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,300
with just a few words, you know.

219
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
I always want it to feel
inspired,

220
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,066
and I definitely want to be
connected to it emotionally.

221
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,867
- Uh!

222
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,467
-<i> Ew!</i>

223
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,533
- Did you really seriously fart?

224
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,934
- [laughing]

225
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,133
- Sick.

226
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,600
- I'm having a hard time
with it.

227
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,633
- You are?

228
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,066
- Yes, I have so many things

229
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,433
that are personal.

230
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,400
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,567
- But I really don't want to

232
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,166
make it personal and sad,

233
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,567
<i>'cause I know it's gonna be sad</i>
<i>for me.</i>

234
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,667
It's just too much, too much.

235
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,300
I hope I don't cry.

236
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,400
-<i> Why would you cry?</i>

237
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,066
-<i> It's a lot of things.</i>

238
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,367
It's a lot of things.

239
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,600
- Like what?

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,633
- There's a lot of things
personal that I...

241
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,233
I wish I could say, but I can't.

242
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,400
- Made in the U.S.A.

243
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,333
Our main challenge today is to
shoot,

244
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,066
like, a 30-second public
service announcement

245
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,333
for our troops.

246
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,300
- Hey.

247
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,333
Can you hear my--
- Go ahead.

248
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,133
- "Right now I'm wearing no
clothes,

249
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,700
"because I don't want any brand,

250
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,367
any stereotypes to cover
who I am."

251
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't want any brand to cover
my identify--my identity.

252
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,367
<i>You like it?</i>

253
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,133
- I didn't get it.

254
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,567
At the competition, Yara is a
very original girl,

255
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,200
and her personality help
her a lot.

256
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,967
But when it comes to talent
and performing,

257
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,967
I think Yara's still behind.

258
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:58,367
- Do you like that idea?
I'm gonna be naked.

259
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:59,867
- Yeah, but, baby, you gotta
let me write.

260
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,400
- Oh.
- You gotta let me write.

261
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,333
- I taught Shangela a few things
about makeup.

262
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,934
And today she doesn't want
to help me.

263
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,100
-<i> If I thought Yara needed</i>
<i>the help,</i>

264
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,233
I would help her,
but she doesn't.

265
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,300
<i>Girl, you can do it.</i>

266
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,867
-<i> Shangela and Alexis are like,</i>
<i>"Do your job."</i>

267
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,467
I know you're doing your job,

268
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:25,266
but before, I was doing my job,

269
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,800
and I helped you.

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,500
- So did you guys grow up
really, like, patriotic

271
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,367
and, like, "We love America"?

272
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,700
- I was born here, but I lived
in Indonesia

273
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,800
when I was a little boy,
and I remember thinking

274
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,333
of America as, like, the land
of candy bars and M&amp;Ms,

275
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,667
<i>so it was kind of a dreamland</i>
<i>for me.</i>

276
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,500
-<i> I know, it's kind of like</i>
<i>my mom,</i>

277
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,834
you know, coming from
a different country

278
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,967
where you're just like,
"America is the dream.

279
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,600
That's where I need to go."

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,667
- Being an American wasn't
something that was hard for me.

281
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,066
I was born into it.

282
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,033
<i>It was easy, but being</i>
<i>Carmen Carrera wasn't,</i>

283
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,467
and being married to my husband
wasn't.

284
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,433
I had to fight for all those
things,

285
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:03,467
so those are the things
that I'm really proud of.

286
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:04,633
[door opens]

287
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:08,066
- Well, hello, my star-spangled
ladies.

288
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,400
- Hi!

289
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,166
- I'm gonna check in and see
what you all are up to.

290
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,200
<i>Hi, Raja.</i>

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,066
What do you love about America?

292
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,400
- I love freedoms that I'm
allowed to have here.

293
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm allowed to get in drag and
parade around the streets

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
and make money doing it.

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,066
- This needs to be uplifting,
entertaining,

296
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,700
and from the heart.

297
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,600
- Yes, sir.
- Okay? All right.

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,433
Carry on.
- All right.

299
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,700
- Hello, Manila.
- Hi.

300
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,600
- Why do you love America?

301
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,834
- There's just so many different
kinds of food here.

302
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:39,166
- So America to you means
a variety of different foods.

303
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,266
- Yes.

304
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,800
- What else does America mean
to you?

305
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,767
- Well, I think that is a symbol
of the diversity of America.

306
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,734
Different ethnicities and
cultures--they're all just

307
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,367
out here for the tasting.

308
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,767
<i>Try something new.</i>

309
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:53,700
Do it with an Indian guy.

310
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,500
- Now, of course, you are gonna
be talking

311
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,767
to the troops who are serving
this great nation of ours,

312
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,633
so we want you to express
yourself,

313
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,533
but just know that we want it to
come from the heart,

314
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,166
not come from between your legs.

315
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,133
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.

316
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,834
- Okay, thank you.
- I can't wait.

317
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,700
Carmen Carrera.

318
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,800
You, as you flutter your false
eyelashes--

319
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,166
is that what being an American
means to you?

320
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,467
- Yes.
I'm free, honey.

321
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,600
- Hello.

322
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,100
- No restrictions,
you know what I mean?

323
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
- Now, tell me what you have
planned for your P.S.A.

324
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,066
- My aunt has six boys,

325
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,633
and most of them are all
in the Army, the Navy.

326
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:30,667
I'm keeping in my mind that my
video's gonna get to them.

327
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,133
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.

328
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,233
- Yara Sofia.
- Yes.

329
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,133
- Now, you're working on
your P.S.A.,

330
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,967
and you understand
where this will go.

331
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,533
- Yes.
- Okay.

332
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,967
- My dad is Army Reserve.

333
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,166
- Has he ever been shipped
overseas?

334
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,967
- Yes, to Iraq.
- Really?

335
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,700
- And you have no communication
with him.

336
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,567
I don't think I'm going
to mention

337
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,533
my father in that P.S.A.,

338
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,734
<i>'cause it's too emotional</i>
<i>for me.</i>

339
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,867
It was a very hard time
in my life.

340
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,700
- You have dialogue that you
will say.

341
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,166
Just give me a synopsis.

342
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,500
- If you don't love America,

343
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?

344
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,133
- [laughing]

345
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,333
- 'Cause you are America.

346
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,467
- It sounds so familiar.
- Yes.

347
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:15,967
- And you're just gonna stand
there.

348
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,667
You're not gonna do any of
the sensual Puerto Rican...

349
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,800
- I could be quiet.

in Bosnia,

359

would be like, "Make me laugh.

00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,233
I met the love of my life.

523
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,567
Now he serve in the U.S.
Military corps.

524
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!

525
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
-<i> Ooh, yeah.</i>

526
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,867
-<i> That's right, just pick it up.</i>

527
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:54,934
- Yeah, keep it going.

528
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,900
- And even if I was born on
the moon,

529
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,300
I would still be in America.

530
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Sexy, no?
- What?

531
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,567
What did she say?

532
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,266
- Sexy, no?

533
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,166
This is so corny, I love it.

534
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,100
- [laughing]

535
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
- I think the troops are gonna
say,

536
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,734
"Who the hell is this crazy-ass
drag queen?"

537
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,033
Bam!

538
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,333
Bam!
Bam!

539
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,700
Get it, baby.

540
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,500
Only in America can a woman like
me have a freakin' chorizo!

541
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
- [laughing]

542
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,467
- Yes, baby!

543
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,700
Bam!

544
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,934
Oh!
-<i> Yeah, catch your breath.</i>

545
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,266
- You got a cramp, girl?

546
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,834
- I'm trying to feel where's
my genitals right now.

547
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,166
- Yes, yes, yes.

548
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,066
Ladies, thank you for serving
your country.

549
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,900
<i>Now, tomorrow I want you to</i>
<i>wear</i>

550
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,300
your most patriotic outfits
to the main stage,

551
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,433
where we will be joined by two
American icons.

552
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,200
<i>Swimsuit supermodel,</i>

553
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,867
the legendary Cheryl Tiegs
will be here...

554
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,066
all: Ooh!

555
00:20:56,066 --> 00:21:00,200
- And Olympic figure skater
Johnny Weir.

556
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,233
- Word!

557
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>Oh, my God, Johnny Weir.</i>

558
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,066
Love her!

559
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,300
<i>I'm gonna lick her if she gets</i>
<i>anywhere near me.</i>

560
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,734
- Good-bye for now,
and God bless America.

561
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:11,967
- Yeah.
- Yes.

562
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,166
- Yoo-hoo!

563
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,633
Show must go on.

564
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,166
- Good mornin'.

565
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,066
-<i> We're back in the workroom</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

566
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:26,500
and we are getting ready
for our patriotic runway.

567
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,800
- Do you guys think that it was
a little difficult

568
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,767
to be entertaining and heartfelt
at the same time?

569
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,800
- When you're not putting on an
act and you're being yourself,

570
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
it's not difficult to put your
feelings in front of everybody

571
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,467
at the same time being yourself.

572
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:42,300
- The way that I did mine was
that the spoken word

573
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,367
was heartfelt, and the visual
was entertaining.

574
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,500
- Did you speak in English
and Spanish?

575
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,734
- No, girl.

576
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,266
- But you speak Spanish,
don't you?

577
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,266
- No, I don't.
I understand Spanish.

578
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,533
- No, you speak Spanish.

579
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:55,934
- I speak broken Spanish.
- She does.

580
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:58,266
- You're Puerto Rican, right?
- Uh-huh.

581
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,800
But my mom is very Americanized.

582
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,300
- I would love to see Carmen

583
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,867
embrace Puerto Rican things.

584
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,967
-<i> I know Puerto Rican culture.</i>

585
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,133
It's always been part of my life

586
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,600
since I was little, but I think

587
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,767
that Yara and Alexis don't think

588
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,533
that I'm Puerto Rican enough,

589
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,400
which I don't care.

590
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,333
[upbeat music]

591
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,600
- Work, Marine Corps.

592
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,700
<i>I'm gonna wear</i>
<i>the military jacket,</i>

593
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,433
because no matter
what I'm wearing

594
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,367
and no matter
if I'm a drag queen

595
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,467
<i>I wanted to show respect</i>
<i>for the militaries</i>

596
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,867
and the Army,

597
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,633
<i>and I hope I look great.</i>

598
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,300
-<i> Ooh, you're so</i>
<i>Michael Jackson.</i>

599
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,400
<i>"Hee-hee!"</i>

600
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,066
-<i> That's a man.</i>

601
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,734
- This challenge
was kind of hard to me,

602
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,266
'cause I will like to entertain

603
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,967
and do happy things.

604
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,667
I don't want to remember
the year

605
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,667
that my father went to Iraq.

606
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:00,533
I miss my mom and my dad
so bad.

607
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:04,133
This challenge remembered me
my dad, of course.

608
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,467
He is Army Reserve.

609
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,967
-<i> I'm sure they miss you too.</i>

610
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,266
- Yes.

611
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,233
<i>A few years ago</i>

612
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,800
we didn't have my father, like,

613
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,934
on year,

614
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:17,734
and it was so, so hard.

615
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,266
Guys, I'm so loud.

616
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:22,734
Without me, the house sounds
really empty.

617
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,467
Sometimes when I'm next
to my father,

618
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:28,533
like, I drop things and--

619
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,867
"Oh!"

620
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,867
Like, watch out, girl!
Watch out, girl!

621
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't be so gay here.

622
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,633
[laughs]

623
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,066
- And you get along with him
well?

624
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:40,100
-<i> Yes.</i>

625
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,667
- Yes. [laughs]

626
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,667

00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,800

<i>Hey, guys.</i>

Welcome to the main stage

Michelle Visage?

631
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:15,300
- Yes, baby?
- God bless America.

632
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,800
And one of our forefathers,
Santino, is here.

633
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,367
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

634
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,800
I am so proud to be a part of
the Wig Party.

635
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,734
- I pledge my allegiance to you,
Ru.

636
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,066
- Good.

637
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:29,700
And Cheryl Tiegs,
the all-American girl, is here.

638
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,066
So glad you're here tonight.

639
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,200
- Thank you, sugar.

640
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600

I am tucked in anticipation.

644

- Good. And keep it that way.

645
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,066
This week our queens were
challenged

646
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,767

public service announcements

647
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,500
<i>to send to our troops overseas.</i>

we salute them.

650
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Gentlemen, start your engines,

695
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,166
-<i> Happy birthday, Mr. President.</i>

696
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,934
-<i> Oh, wow!</i>
<i>- Nava-ho.</i>

697
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,934
-<i> How!</i>
<i>- That's all I ever heard.</i>

698
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,467
-<i> I've chosen tonight to do</i>
<i>a look</i>

699
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,400
<i>that's a little bit</i>
<i>Native American</i>

700
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
<i>and a lot of rock and roll.</i>

701
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
-<i> "Dances with drag queens."</i>

702
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,900
-<i> Yes.</i>

703
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,333
<i>"Legend of the Walks Far</i>
<i>Woman."</i>

704
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,100
Welcome, my fellow
drag Americans.

705
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,066
- Yes.
- All right, let's get to it.

706
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,633
Let's start with Shangela.

707
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,133
Cheryl, what'd you think of
Shangela's runway presentation?

708
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,066
- The outfit is very, uh,
simple.

709
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,500
<i>You see the others--there's</i>
<i>a lot more going on.</i>

710
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,533
- The lame is coming off
a little lame for me.

711
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,266
You know, it's not quite
banging enough.

712
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,500
- Thank you, Amadeus.
- [laughing]

713
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,600
- Let's take a look at your
P.S.A.

714
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,500
- Hey, all you fierce-ass
freedom fighters, it's me,

715
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,934
Shangela, and let me tell you,
I appreciate you out there.

716
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:37,900
We miss you, and we want you
home safely...

729
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,467
- I felt like the costume,

730
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,900
the singing, everything was
so fun and vibrant.

731
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,700
- All right, next up,
Carmen Carrera.

732
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,200
- The Statue of Liberty--

733
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,467
ever since I was a child,

734
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,500
it has been a symbol of freedom,

735
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,867
acceptance, and diversity

736
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,333
for everyone to be able to live
the American dream.

737
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,500
Our forefathers have made it
possible for us,

738
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,133
and now it's you who's ensuring
the future of our children.

739
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:27,300
- Yes.

740
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,166
- Carmen, you have to stay
in character.

741
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,800
You have a tendency to,
dare I say, look bored.

742
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,867
-<i> That was my biggest thing.</i>

743
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:35,200
I wanted you to excite me

744
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,834
and make me want to sign up,

745
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,867
<i>but it was just very, very</i>
<i>soft.</i>

746
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,633
I just wanted a little bit more
command of the voice,

747
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:44,066
especially with this attitude
and this look that you've got.

748
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:47,433
- Carmen, when you first
came out, I gasped.

749
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,667
<i>It was very sultry.</i>

750
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,066
Standing here, you've lost that
a little bit.

751
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:53,333
- You're standing there like
you could really give two shits

752
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,533
about what we think.

753
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,367
- No, I don't want you
to think that.

754
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,800
- But that's how it's coming
across.

755
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
All right, ladies, next up,

756
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Alexis Mateo.

757
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,166
Now, you told me in
the workroom

758
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,667
that you had a lover who went
to war.

759
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,066
Did you direct your P.S.A.
toward him?

760
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,066
- I tried to make my P.S.A.

761
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,300
a little bit underground message
for him.

762
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,233
Oh, my gosh, if he was watching
right now,

763
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:22,066
I would've loved to say that
I miss him a lot.

764
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,066
Inside my heart,
I'm still waiting for you.

765
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,300
- Well, let's take a look
at your patriotic P.S.A..

766
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,533
- It's Alexis Mateo<i> con sabor</i>
from Puerto Rico!

767
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,934
This is the only land

768
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:37,100
where you can grow up and become
whoever you want to be.

769
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,133
I'm a fucking drag queen!

770
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,834
Ha ha ha!

771
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,600
Bam!
Bam!

772
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,934
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!

773
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:49,533
Celebrate life.
Celebrate love.

774
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:52,300
Celebrate freedom.

775
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,734
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ooh-ee.

776
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,367
- Bam, Michelle Visage.

777
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,867
- Bam!

778
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,867
<i>Alexis, you came out with one</i>
<i>thing you wanted to do.</i>

779
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:04,033
That was dance and be happy with
a piece of lame,

780
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,300
<i>and it worked.</i>

781
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,433
We couldn't breathe,
we were laughing so hard.

782
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,834
- Your P.S.A. was so much fun.

783
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:12,100
<i>"I'm a fucking drag queen!"</i>

784
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,767
<i>That sums it up.</i>

785
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:14,834
That's right, mama.

786
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,633
- Thank you, Beethoven.

787
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,867
Is this the jacket of
your ex-boyfriend?

788
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:22,700
- Yes, he left me this
as a memory.

789
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,667
So today I decide to wear it.

790
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,200
- If you're all covered up
in the high neck on the jacket,

791
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,900
<i>show us a little something.</i>

792
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,567
You know, you don't have
to show us everything.

793
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,567
I don't want to see your
honey basket.

794
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,600
- [laughs]

795
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,300
-<i> I love a queen in uniform.</i>

796
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,333
And you respected this,
and by "respect,"

797
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,166
I mean definitely put
Swarovskis all over it.

798
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,266
[laughter]

799
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:45,433
- All right, next up,
Yara Sofia.

800
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,800
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

801
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,467
- This is the national costume
for dancing.

802
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,600
It's called bomba.

803
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,500
This is also part
of their religion.

804
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,767
It's called Santeria.

805
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,533
- You're not gonna kill
a chicken, are you?

806
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:57,467
- No, no!

807
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:00,066
- 'Cause I'm hungry, girl.

808
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,800
Let's take a look and see
what happened.

809
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,700
- I'm Yara Sofia,
and I love America.

810
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,066
America let me be the Latina!

811
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,633
I feel free, darling!

812
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:14,834
Hey!

813
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,433
If you don't love America,

814
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:20,800
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?

815
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,667
- Okay,<i> guapa,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this is the deal.</i>

816
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,600
Your P.S.A.,
don't just be crazy.

817
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,700
If you're gonna be crazy,
be crazy with a purpose.

818
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,066
I expect more from you now,
Yara.

819
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,633
- It was a little bit crazy.
I'm not gonna lie.

820
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:36,166
<i>There wasn't a lot of class</i>
<i>and integrity in it.</i>

821
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:39,500
<i>I just thought it was kind of</i>
<i>jumping all over the place.</i>

822
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,567
- All right, next up,
our flapper, Manila.

823
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,133
Tell us about your look.

824
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,633
- Well, I'm trying to go for
a thoroughly modern millionaire.

825
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,934
-<i> Oh, I love it.</i>

826
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,934
Well, let's take a look
at your P.S.A.

827
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,500
- I'm an American,

828
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,300
and I love to eat out at
different kinds of restaurants.

829
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,500
Only in America will you find
the diversity

830
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,200
of different backgrounds
and ethnicities,

831
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,333
and each of them offer a
different kind of food to eat--

832
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,734
hot dogs, sushi, Italian,
kielbasa.

833
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,233
[imitating flatulence]

834
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,500
Oh, America, you taste so good.

835
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,967
- Being a lady, I am not quite
so sure

836
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,066
about when you emit some gas.

837
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,667
[laughs]

838
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,333
- Relying on a fart joke
in the P.S.A.,

839
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,200
<i>the message of having freedom</i>
<i>of choice</i>

840
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,600
<i>just got completely lost</i>
<i>for me.</i>

841
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
- Thank you, Mr. Lagerfeld.

842
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,633
- [laughing]

843
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,100
-<i> Manila, I am so in love</i>
<i>with you tonight.</i>

844
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,600
I love everything about this
look on you.

845
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>It's absolutely stunning to me.</i>

846
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,133
I just gotta be honest, I can't
stand you as a blonde girl.

847
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,633
-<i> The blond wig and the outfit,</i>

848
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,066
I just felt I saw
Jessica Simpson,

849
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:52,266
and I feel like I wouldn't want
to look like Jessica Simpson.

850
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,166
- All right, next up, Raja.

851
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:57,500
Can you get more American than
Native American?

852
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,200
- How.
- [laughing]

853
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,633
- Let's take a look at your
patriotic P.S.A.

854
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:07,066
- I'm Raja, and I'm proud to be
am American.

855
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,066
<i>Growing up in Indonesia,</i>

856
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>my parents taught me that I</i>
<i>could be</i>

857
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,934
<i>whatever I wanted to be.</i>

858
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:15,533
<i>America--where the son</i>
<i>of immigrants</i>

859
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:18,934
can wear her freedom proudly.

860
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,233
- Raja, I thought you were
amazing on the runway.

861
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,300
The P.S.A. was a little stiff.

862
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,767
- Take me to your tepee.

863
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,066

direction of bathroom humor.

1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,600
- Previously on
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,867
- Coco Montrese.

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,033
- Alyssa Edwards.

4
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,166
- We haven't spoken
in two years.

5
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,433
The pageant
tore our friendship apart.

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,066
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later together,

7
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,767
'cause we need a moment.

8
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:19,900
- You'll be lip-synching
to the spoken word, darling.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,367
- I think Lineysha
is going to struggle the most

10
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,500
because of the language barrier.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,867
- This is not
<i>Rupaul's Best Friend Race.</i>

12
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,400
- No [bleep], Sherlock.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,467
I'm not focused, because I have
so much going on in my head.

14
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,533
[choked up]
I'm not just a drag queen.

15
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,734
I'm a transgendered woman.

16
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,734
- One of you really
lip-smacked the competition.

17
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,800
Lineysha Sparx.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,033
- [laughs]

19
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,700
- Monica Beverly Hillz...

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,100
Shante, you stay.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Serena Chacha...

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,166
sashay away.

23
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,066
[footsteps approach]

24
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,066
- [sighs]

25
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,967
- Chacha,<i> adios,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darling.</i>

26
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:08,266
- We're back in the workroom,
and Serena went home.

27
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,066
Came a mess.
Left a mess.

28
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,066
- Ooh!

29
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,233
[laughter]

30
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,867
- As you can tell,
I am just very upset.

31
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,967
[laughs]

32
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,934
- "Keep hearing light."
What does that mean?

33
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,667
- "Bearing light."
- Oh.

34
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,066
- Oh, okay.

35
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:23,300
'Cause the only thing I was
hearing was "Sashay away."

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,367
[laughter]

37
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,500
- Well, on that note.

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,567
[sighs]

39
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,066
I'm happy I survived
the lip-synch.

40
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,600
And I let out a huge secret.

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,633
It really took a toll today,
and I just felt like,

42
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,633
you know what?

43
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,066
I can't hold
that secret no more.

44
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,266
- Yeah, seriously.
- Be proud.

45
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,834
- We all love you.
- We love you.

46
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,233
- So, speaking of secrets,

47
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,266
what the hell is going on
with you and Coco?

48
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,066
- Look, at the end of the day,

49
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,800
this, right here, I won.

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,467
- Mm.

51
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,800
- But who's in the picture?

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,300
- Miss Coco.

53
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,667
- I think you should ask Coco.

54
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,400
- I want to know the T
on what happened

55
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
between you and Alyssa...

56
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,600
- Oh, God.

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,233
- Because this has been
going on for so long.

58
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,700
- They crowned her
that night, you know?

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
And things happen, and...

60
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,934
obligations weren't fulfilled.

61
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,633
And it put us in a situation

62
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,633
where our friendship
was on the line.

63
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,700
- 'Cause you took her spot.

64
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,467
- Legally, I had to do that.

65
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,767
- Every story has two sides.

66
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,533
- With all the controversy
at Miss Gay America,

67
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,433
this is a personal vendetta
for myself.

68
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,767
I think it's time for me
to get this off my chest.

69
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,834
- The winner of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

70
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,934
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,

a luxury trip

and a cash prize of $100,000.

74
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,767
And tonight,
extra special guest judges

75
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,300
Paulina Porizkova and Coco.

76
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,433
- Whoo!
- Whoo.

77
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,900
- Yay!

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,066
- [together]
Rolaskatox.

79
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,133
- It's a new day.

80
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,834
I'm walking into the workroom,

81
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,900
wondering what the hell
is about to happen.

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,500
No more groups.
- No.

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,800
- No more groups.

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
[siren blares]

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,867
- Ooh, girl!

86
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,700
You've got shemail.

87
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Hey, my little ladyboys.

88
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
all: Hey.

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,233
- Growing up is so overrated,

90
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,066
and America's next
drag superstar

91
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,500
needs to really embrace
her inner child

92
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,834
if she's gonna become one fierce
mother-tucker.

93
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,967
This message was brought to you
by the letter T.

94
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

95
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,633
- Oh.
- Hello, hello, hello.

96
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,867
[overlapping greetings]

97
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,567
Do you know what time it is?

98
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,867
all: No.

99
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,600
- It's time for the junior
drag superstar pageant!

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,834
- Oh!

101
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,367
[all exclaiming]

102
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,900
- Instantly, I'm thinking,
"A pageant?"

103
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,600
This is my gig, and I've been
quite successful at it.

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,700
- But, ladies, you won't be
the contestants.

105
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,567
You need to turn these boy toys

106
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,166
into cutie patooties.

107
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,200
[giggles]

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
[laughter]

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Pick a partner.

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,467
- I looked to the left and said,
"Oh, hell no.

111
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,066
I'm not working with Alyssa."

112
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:16,266
- You've got 15 minutes.

113
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,066
The team with the most sickening

114
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:21,100
painted baby will win.

115
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,867
Ready, set, drag the children.

116
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:28,066
- Whoa!

117
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,100
- Oh!

118
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,467
- You know, we're all
considered kai kai now.

119
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,066
We have daughters
with another queen.

120
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,667
- Our girl's gonna win
grand supreme.

121
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,433
You just watch.

122
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,700
- Little flippers.

123
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
- [laughs]

124
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,433
- Don't mess it up,
or you won't get no go-go juice.

125
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:45,066
I immediately
turn into pageant mom.

126
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,867
Now, I never could make it
in the pageant scene

127
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,800
when I was a girl, so you're
so lucky you get to do this.

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,533
- Time's up.

129
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:57,400
Now, may I present the drag
superstars of tomorrow.

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,900
First up,
Roxxxy Andrews and Detox.

131
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
- Hi, I'm Rachel Zoe,
and this is our daughter,

132
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Vaxeline Androxxx Zoe.

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,433
She just wants to go to Paris
every weekend and see the shows,

134
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,600
dressed in
all the finest couture.

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,200
And because I'm Rachel Zoe,
we allow that.

136
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,166
- [laughs]

137
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,400
- She's kind of a big deal.

138
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,934
[camera shutter snaps]

139
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:22,734
- I'd like to present
little Tina Lou Devereaux.

140
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,333
She wants to make makeup

141
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,066
and fashionable accessories

142
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,800
more accessible to young girls,

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
because it is never too young

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
to start upholding
the "Amurrican" ideal

145
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,567
of "femininitity".

146
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,400
[laughter]

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,433
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.

148
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,233
- Watermelon is decked out
in glitz,

149
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,166
glamour, and a flipper

150
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,800
she's able to grow into
for the years to come.

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,767
She's a world champion
watermelon seed spitter.

152
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,266
- [laughs]

153
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,834
- I present to you
our very own Savannah Lee.

154
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,800
She is a former Miss Mesquite,

155
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Little Miss America.

156
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,934
Her platform in life

157
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,367
is world peace for all.

158
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,166
- Thank you very much.

159
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,800
Thank you very much.

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,567
[applause]

161
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,266
- Now that's a modern family.

162
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,266
- I'd like everyone to meet

163
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,066
Lil' Pound Cake.

164
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,467
Her catchphrase is,

165
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,633
"You're not my real dad,
and you never will be."

166
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:19,767
- [laughing]

167
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,467
- Lil' Pound Cake
enjoys riding dirty

168
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,834
and being a straight-up
mother [bleep] [bleep] pig.

169
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,934
[laughter]

170
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,133
- [cackling]

171
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,433
- Monica and I have our
daughter, Patty Park Place.

172
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,166
She's won several pageants,

173
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,567
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.

174
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,867
- Oh!

175
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,900
- Coco Montrese decides
to throw a little bit of shade

176
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,066
to be real cute.

177
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,100
I don't get cute.

178
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,433
I get drop-dead gorgeous.

179
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,834
[whispers] Shade.

180
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:55,333
- So, the miss junior
drag superstar is...

181
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,700
Lil' Pound Cake.

182
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
- Oh!

183
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,767
- All hail Lil' Pound Cake.

184
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,700
[camera shutter snaps]

185
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,266
Now, for this week's
main challenge,

186
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:13,066
you'll be creating lovable,
eccentric characters

187
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,967
for your own
kidster television shows.

188
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,467
[all exclaiming]

189
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,066
- Children's TV?

190
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,266
I'm like, "What the
mother [bleep] hell?"

191
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,700
- Your target audience
is the young

192
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,633
and the young at heart,

193
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:30,633
so your program
should be both entertaining

194
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,066
and "edumacational."

195
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,066
You'll be working in two groups.

196
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:38,433
Lineysha and Alaska, since
you won the mini-challenge,

197
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,734
you'll be team captains.

198
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,900
Lineysha, you pick first.

199
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,100
- Honey.

200
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,233
- Toxie.

201
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,200
- Coco Montrese.
- Hey, girl.

202
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,166
- Roxxx-an.
- Rolaskatox!

203
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,567
both: Rolaskatox!

204
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,266
[laughter]

205
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,967
- Jinkx.

206
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,667
- Vivienne.

207
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,066
- [nasal voice]
Ivy Winterrr.

208
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,233
[laughs]

209
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,166
[nasal voice]
Winterrrs.

210
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,367
- "Montica".

211
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,400
- Yay.

212
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,500
- All right, Lineysha.

213
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,533
Who do you choose next?

214
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,367
- [whispers indistinctly]

215
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,834
We were all in Lineysha's ear

216
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,333
saying, "Don't pick Alyssa."

217
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,867
- Jade.

218
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,066
- [whispers] Thank God.

219
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,700
- So Alyssa will go
to Alaska's team.

220
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,100
- Darling.

221
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,066
- I might have been picked last,
but honestly,

222
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,333
I ended up on the team
that I wanted to be on.

223
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,100
The queens of the competition.

224
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,166
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

225
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:37,500
And may the best woman win.

226
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,967
- I have a idea.

227
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,133
Why you can't make,
like, a muppet,

228
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,233
and take talking like,
"la la la la," and--

229
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,967
- Ohh.
- Ventriloquist?

230
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,100
- Ventriloquist, so--

231
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,834
- Yes, you,
and she's the little girl.

232
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,367
- Oh,
like a ventriloquist dummy.

233
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,433
- Girl, they 'bout to try
to send me home.

234
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,367
In the show in Vegas,
I'm the star.

235
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,133
So when you give me a role
like a ventriloquist doll...

236
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:02,700
- So what are some things
that we can talk about?

237
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,834
Um...

238
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,200
- Um...

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,467
- Now is the hard part.

240
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,600
We have to actually
come up with the material.

241
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,500
I'm trying to find out--figure
out how to make it funny.

242
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,800
- This is really, really hard.

243
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
- At some point,
I think Coco got frustrated

244
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,367
and kind of walked off.

245
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,367
- I want to wear my hair up.

246
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,467
I'll be glad when
the group challenges are over.

247
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,266
- I'm kind of panicking.

248
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,300
How are we gonna pull this off?

249
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,800
- Coming up...

250
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,200
It never occurred to me that
you'd actually be out of drag.

251
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,700
- I'm in drag, Ru.

252
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,400
- But you're in a male drag.

253
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,800
- I heard that you went around
everywhere and badmouthed me.

254
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,066
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.

255
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:50,100
- [laughing]

256
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,567
- So our challenge
is to put together

257
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,066
a children's television show

258
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,000
which is full of sneaky little
dirty double-entendres.

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Our word of the day is "box."

260
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,533
This is the challenge
that I've been waiting for.

261
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,600
Finally we get to act
and we get to write

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,633
and we get to create.

263
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,066
I'm gonna be a farmer.

264
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,166
And we can each be,
like, a barnyard animal.

265
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,600
- I'll be the chicken lady.

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
- And you should be, like,
Venus Xtravaganza.

267
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
You should be her.

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,667
"Oh, you wanna talk about..."

269
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,066
both: "Reading, dahling."

270
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:26,934
- You can just be Uncle Dick
the cross-dresser.

271
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,667
- Be, like,
real butch about it.

272
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,300
[rough voice]
Look at how pretty I am.

273
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,867
And not fishy.

274
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:32,934
- Really?

275
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,667
The cross-dressing uncle?

276
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,967
Girl, they're pulling the patch.

277
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,333
Can't be bothered.

278
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,900
Do you think
it would be more funny,

279
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,000
'cause she's fishier than me,
if she was the Uncle Dick?

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,133
- I like you
as a cross-dresser.

281
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,633
I'm a little worried about
Alyssa because she's very much

282
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,266
into, "Oh,
Alyssa has to look this way,

283
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,867
and Alyssa
has to look that way."

284
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,166
And I hope that doesn't
hold us back.

285
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,100
- Hello, hello, hello.

286
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,667
[all shouting greetings]

287
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,433
Did I catch you boys
playing dress-up?

288
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,467
- Uh-huh.

289
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,433
- Well, hello, team Alaska.

290
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,633
all: Hi, Ru.

291
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,567
- How's it going over here?
- It's going.

292
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,500
- Who's gonna be your host?
- Hi.

293
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,066
- Now, what character
are you doing?

294
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,734
- Buffalo Bill.
- Oh, okay.

295
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:16,066
- And, um, it's a barnyard,

296
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:19,934
and our show is called something
like<i> Barnyard Boogers.</i>

297
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,133
- [laughs]

298
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,633
So who's doing
the word of the day?

299
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,400
- That's me.
- What is the word of the day?

300
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,433
- Box.

301
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,266
- Box?
- B-o-x.

302
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,567
- Of course.

303
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,133
And it's just now coming to me
how you can make--

304
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,667
- A lot of things
come in my box.

305
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,300
- [laughs] Yes, a lot of things
could come in your box, exactly.

306
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,867
[laughter]

307
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,133
Now, what are you kids doing?

308
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,633
- She's teaching the social
lesson of the day.

309
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,934
- Don't be throwing no shade.

310
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,834
- And how do you get kids
to not throw shade?

311
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,233
Well, you know,
the thing about these shows,

312
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,200
especially, like,<i> </i>
<i>Pee-wee's Playhouse,</i>

313
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,133
is that a lot
of what you're doing here

314
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,867
has a subversive twist to it.

315
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,100
Do you have a message
that you're trying to convey

316
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,200
to the children?

317
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,266
- Down with communism.

318
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,567
[laughter]

319
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,567
- Okay.

320
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,367
You guys have
a lot of work to do,

321
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,133
and I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?

322
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,367
- Thank you, Ru.

323
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,500
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Thank you, Ru.

324
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,200
- Hey, team Lineysha.

325
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,700
all: Hi.

326
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,667
- So tell me about your
kidster show.

327
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,800
Who's gonna do your "how to"
segment?

328
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
- Lineysha and myself.
- Oh, really?

329
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,900
- We are making banana splits.

330
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
- In two languages.

331
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,433
- What are you gonna do to
really send it over the top?

332
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,800
- It's gonna be funny.
[laughs]

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,867
- All right.

334
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,066
Are you the host?

335
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,066
- Yes, Lineysha asked me
to be the host.

336
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,767
- And which--
what part of the challenge

337
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:41,834
have you been assigned?

338
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,400
- Actually, Coco and I
are both doing

339
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,233
the social lesson
for the day.

340
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,266
- Which is what?

341
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,166
- It's "Always tell the T."

342
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,867
- Of course.

343
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:50,967
- T.T. and Tiny.

344
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,266
T.T.'s always teaching Tiny
to tell the T.

345
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,533
- Right.

346
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,867
Are you gonna be able
to bring the funny, though?

347
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,066
- I think we're gonna
focus more on quality

348
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,467
and not quantity.

349
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:02,867
- All right.

350
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:06,133
Well, you kids have a lot
to work with.

351
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,400
You've got a lot to do.

352
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,066
So I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?

353
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,066
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right, turn it out.

354
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,500
- Thank you, Ru.

355
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,200
- We'll just have to show Ru
that we all can be funny.

356
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,333
- Look, do you like that look?

357
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,533
- You look like Willam.

358
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,500
- [laughs]

359
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,066
- Hello, ladies.

360
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,467
- Hi, Rupaul.

361
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,467
We're right about to shoot
our TV show for kids,

362
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,834
and I'm feeling very excited,

363
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,633
because I really feel like
we're gonna nail it.

364
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,100
- It's funny, 'cause when
we talked in the workroom,

365
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,066
and you said Buffalo Bill,
it never occurred to me

366
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,700
that you'd actually
be out of drag.

367
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,233
- I'm in drag, Ru.

368
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:52,300
- But you're in a male drag.

369
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,767
That's an interesting choice.

370
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,233
- Here we go.

371
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,367
We're going to get read
before we even start?

372
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,400
Two thumbs down.

373
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,367
- All right, Michelle and I
are here to direct you.

374
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,800
So show us what you got.

375
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,767
Action.

376
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,934
- Look, everybody.

377
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,400
It's clucky the cock!

378
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,500
- [clucking]

379
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,734
It's our secret word of the day.

380
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,567
You want to hear what it is?

381
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,800
It's "box"!

382
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,967
- Whoa!

383
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:17,967
- [laughs]

384
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,367
- Cut.

385
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,567
Clucky, you're delivering
your lines to Buffalo Bill.

386
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,233
You've got to play
more to the camera.

387
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,233
Action.

388
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:26,800
- So many things
fit inside my box.

389
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,133
- [laughing]

390
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,100
- This is a petite box.

391
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,433
I don't think it's Michelle's.

392
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,834
- [guffaws]

393
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,633
- [squawking]
Boxes!

394
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,734
- [lisping]
I am so excited to be here!

395
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:40,233
I'm ready to toss
your salad, Anita.

396
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,333
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.

397
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,233
- I like a cheesy salad.

398
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,934
- Cut. Vivienne...
- Yeah?

399
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,433
- If you can bring your energy
up to meet Roxxxy's--

400
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,800
- Okay.

401
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,867
- It feels like you're in
two different sketches.

402
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,333
- You get lost.

403
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,967
- [flat] Say, let's go get our
other friends to toss our salad.

404
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,400
- Moving on.

405
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,066
- It's real sunny up here,

406
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,467
but I do like
a little bit of shade.

407
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,166
- Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?

408
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,200
Sunlight on the skin...

409
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,166
Boom. I blank.

410
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
- Cut.

411
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,867
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun on this skin?

412
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,133
Sunlight is, uh--

413
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,367
- Cut.

414
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,066
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun?

415
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,633
Sunlight on the skin--

416
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,600
[bleep].

417
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,867
I'm, like, totally [bleep]
my [bleep] bathing suit.

418
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,367
And that's not cute.

419
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,333
- Monica, do you want to look
at the lines again?

420
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,166
- Yeah, they're right here.

421
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,266
- Oh, they are.
- And you're not reading it?

422
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,233
- All right, ladies.

423
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,066
Fantastic.

424
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,800
- When you're team captain,

425
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,633
if the whole thing
goes like a train wreck,

426
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,800
then it's you
who has to pay for it.

427
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,066
Ugh.

428
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,700
- Coming up...

429
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,967
- A nice, plump banana.

430
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,633
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>

431
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:07,734
- Lineysha just literally
translated it.

432
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,734
- And this is my little friend.

433
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,300
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.

434
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,867
- Is that it?

435
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,900
[laughing]

436
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,433
- We're walking on set to shoot
our children's television show.

437
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,834
- And they are all in drag.

438
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,066
- Funny how that works
on<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>

439
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,166
- Uh-huh.

440
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,967
- Comedy's kind of my thing,

441
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,133
so I'm really excited
to really shine.

442
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,367
- All right,
let's see your big opening.

443
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:42,233
- Are you guys excited
for today's episode?

444
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,200
The word of the day is...

445
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,400
"blow."

446
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,367
- Jinkx revealed my word, blow.

447
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,734
It kind of threw me off.

448
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:52,133
I had a speech ready,
and everything rhymed,

449
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,867
so I just had to scramble
and just kind of

450
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,266
come up with something quick.

451
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:58,166
If you think of blow,
I think of bubbles.

452
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,500
- Oh, look at all those bubbles
you're blowing!

453
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,066
- Blow.
[giggles]

454
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,367
- Cut.

455
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:15,066
Jade, it took you a little bit
longer to land the lines.

456
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,533
Get to the point
a little faster.

457
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,433
- Little aggravated.

458
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,800
- Action.

459
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,166
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.

460
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,500
And the ingredients are a nice,

461
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,667
plump banana.

462
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:33,233
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>

463
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,266
- Lineysha is not really
bringing the Latin flavor

464
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,066
that I thought
she was going to bring.

465
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,300
- Go ahead and cut that in half.

466
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,166
-<i> En Espanol,</i>
<i>cortalo por la mitad.</i>

467
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,066
- She just literally
translated it.

468
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,100
- Cherries.

469
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,800
- All right, moving on.

470
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,066
- Hello, everyone.

471
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm T.T., and this
is my little friend...

472
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,333
we haven't even practiced.

473
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,533
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.

474
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,600
- Jessica.

475
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,734
- All right, cut.

476
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,834
- Your timing is too slow.

477
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,867
You need to pick it up.
Coco, you need to be on it.

478
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:17,133
- Ready, and action.

479
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,266
- What's the T?

480
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:21,734
Why do they really
call you Tiny?

481
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,233
- 'Cause I'm small.

482
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,300
Yeah.

483
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm a ventriloquist doll.

484
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,834
I don't know if I'm supposed
to look at the camera,

485
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:31,867
look away from the camera.

486
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:35,367
- Coco, think more Pinocchio

487
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:39,100
and less the puppet from<i> Saw.</i>

488
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,533
- Do you have something
that you'd like to say?

489
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,066
- Is that it?

490
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,300
- That's it.

491
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,500
- All right.

492
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,600
Do you have any notes?

493
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,166
- Nope.
- Okay, that's a wrap.

494
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,367
all: Rolaskatox.

495
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:01,166
- It's elimination day, and
today's theme for the runway

496
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,667
is "think pink".

497
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,700
Jinkx.
- Mm-hmm?

498
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,900
- Are you gonna
add that hair into that hair?

499
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
- Yeah.

500
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,500
My grandma got me this wig

501
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,266
when I was, like, 17.

502
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,100
- So your grandma
was buying you wigs, girl?

503
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,467
- My mom wasn't really into it.
- Uh-huh.

504
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,867
- But my grandma and I
would be getting me in drag,

505
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,834
and then I'd go out to the club.

506
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:23,066
She'd let me be
who I wanted to be, you know?

507
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,934
My grandma made it possible
for me to do drag

508
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,233
at a very early age.

509
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,333
And that's when I really started

510
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,266
coming alive.

511
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,700
She helped set up my life

512
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,066
to put me where I am today.

513
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,667
So it has a lot of sentimental
value to me.

514
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,200
- I feel so mentally drained
right now.

515
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm trying to finish my costume,

516
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
and this whole Alyssa thing,

517
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
it's still bothering me.

518
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,800
We competed at Miss Gay America
together.

519
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,333
- Huh?
- They crowned her.

520
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,266
I ended up having
to take over the title.

521
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,867
We haven't talked in two years.

522
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,467
- Coco, if you want to come talk
to me, you can talk to me,

523
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,767
but you don't have to read me
over there, though.

524
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:08,900
- I'm not reading you.

525
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,633
I'm not saying
anything about you.

526
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,300
I've got to get this
off my back.

527
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,667
This needs to be done.

528
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,667
Can I talk to you, like,
five minutes, just me and you?

529
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:22,700
- Oh, [bleep], this is gonna get
[bleep] interesting.

530
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,834
Let me get some popcorn.

531
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,867
- It was pure hell.

532
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,133
- Okay.

533
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,033
- How would you feel
if you're standing onstage

534
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,900
with a crown on your head,
singing your song,

535
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,066
and someone yells out,

536
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,867
"You ain't the real
Miss America anyway!"

537
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,734
I just smile and wave.

538
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,467
In the inside, I am torn.

539
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,734
I almost lost my relationship
because of that whole thing.

540
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,667
That whole thing
turned my world upside-down.

541
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,333
- Well, I lost
my whole reputation

542
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,667
I'd worked ten years for.
[chuckles]

543
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,600
He didn't win Miss Gay America.
I did.

544
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,066
So he wasn't the one embarrassed
in front of the whole community.

545
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,433
I was. I'm the very first
to get dethroned.

546
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,700
Nobody gets dethroned.

547
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,467
I'm not a drug addict.
I'm not an alcoholic.

548
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,734
I'm a teacher.
I'm a mentor. I'm a leader.

549
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,367
But, Coco, I heard
that you went around everywhere

550
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,700
and badmouthed me, saying
I couldn't fulfill my reign.

551
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,800
You got on your face--hold on.
Let me finish.

552
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,967
But, see, you're doing all that,

553
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,433
and you're not even
being fair to me.

554
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,300
- I am being fair to you.
I'm listening to you.

555
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,633
- Girl, you are saying, "I'm on
the beach drinking a margarita.

556
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,333
I'm the one with the crown.
I'm the one."

557
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,433
- I don't--I--

558
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,867
- Why did you write
on your Facebook,

559
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,867
"Alyssa shouldn't have won
in the first place"?

560
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,133
Do you feel like
that was a hit below the belt?

561
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:29,700
- [crying] I laid in bed next
to my husband, and, like, God--

562
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,333
he's like,
"What is wrong with you?"

563
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,767
And I can't--I couldn't take it.
And--

564
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,834
- And then the tears come out.

565
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,433
Coco is doing what he does best.

566
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,967
He's making it seem like
he's the victim.

567
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,400
He's always the victim.

568
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,867
And the Academy Award goes to...

569
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,066
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.

570
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:55,667
- I gave him the benefit of
the doubt and got nothing back.

571
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,500
- This whole thing
was not resolved.

572
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,767
I'm done with that situation.

573
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,867
I got to get ready
for the runway.

574
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,800
- [laughing]

575
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,300
Welcome to the main stage of

576
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,066
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>

577
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:29,133
Michelle Visage,
won't you be my neighbor?

578
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,300
- Always, my little lemon drop.

579
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
- [laughs]

580
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,934
Santino Rice.

581
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,967
- I am ready to school
these children.

582
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:39,100
- I look at her here,
and I see seductive.

583
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,066
I look at her hair,
and I see wicked beauty.

584
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,166
Paulina Porizkova.

585
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,700
- I am so glad to be here.

586
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,266
I've been trying to get on your
damn show for five years now.

587
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,767
[laughter]

588
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,333
- Mrs. T's in the house.

589
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,633
Coco.

590
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,567
Rupaul loves Coco too.

591
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,567
- I love Rupaul.

592
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,734
- [laughs]

593
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:02,233
This week,
our queens were challenged

594
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,266
to create breakout characters

595
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,767
in their own
kidster television shows.

596
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:10,166
And tonight, they're dressed
to tickle you pink.

597
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,300
- Whoo.

598
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,066
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

599
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,333
And may the best woman win.

600
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,667
Coming up...

601
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:20,734
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--

602
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,266
you bored me.

603
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:27,300
- [laughing]

604
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:35,900
First up, the 49th state,

605
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,467
Alaska.

606
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,800
So pink mafia.

607
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,333
- I look like a ghost
from the Civil War.

608
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,100
A McQueen fashion show.

609
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
- She bleeds pink.

610
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,200
- She's a sex pistol.

611
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
- Monica Beverly Hillz.

612
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,066
Someone caught the bouquet.

613
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,200
- I'm feeling extra fishy.

614
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,266
My nails are right.

615
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,233
My hair's tight.

616
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,266
I'm just giving it.

617
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,066
- This is very
Singapore Airlines.

618
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,066

620
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100

- I am channeling
my Little Miss Perfect gig.

622
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,800
It's the deal. It's the ish.

623
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,633
- Madonna reborn again.

624
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,100
- Yes.

625
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,066
- Vivienne Pinay.

626
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,834
- Hold me closer, tiny dancer.

627
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,066
[laughter]

628
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,800
- I'm feeling cute,
prissy, and girly.

629
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,066
And the judges
are really eating it up.

630
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,266
- Ooh.

631
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:26,066
- I think I just saw
her pink slip.

632
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,867
[laughter]

633
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,734
Next up, Detox.

- This is
<i>Playboy: The Victorian Years.</i>

635
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,266
- My tits are bouncing
everywhere.

636
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,233
I mean, I have a great body,
so why not show it off?

637
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,900
- Okay, no kidding,
I have this outfit.

638
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,467
- [laughs]

639
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,967
- She is a hot mesh.

640
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,200
Roxxxy Andrews.

641
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,300
- Bam.

642
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,533
- Pink Panther on the runway.

643
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,867
- The dress is flowing.

644
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,867
I look drop-dead gorgeous.

645
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:51,934
- It's a mullet dress!

646
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,767
- [laughs]
- Uh-huh.

647
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,934

- Lineysha Sparx.

649
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,934
Sell the garment, honey.

650

- I feel so fierce, flawless,

651
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,400
like a top model.

652
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,667

got a hot date.

down the runway

657
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,467
with my snuff box,

658
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,867
let them eat all this cake,
bitches.

662
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,633
- Shirley Temple Black?

663
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:28,900
- Why it got to be black?

664
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,133
- I am giving you
your baby doll fish.

665
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,467
I look so cute.

666
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,667
- I didn't know
she was into bears.

667
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,233

- Yes.

671
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,066
- I'm strutting
like a Vegas showgirl.

672
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,700
I feel like
a beautiful flamingo.

673
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,800
- You can just stick her
in somebody's front lawn.

674

676
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,066

- Very Bed Bath and Beyonce.

678
00:25:57,734 --> 00:25:59,066
- [laughs]

679
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,066
- I am feeling really strong,
pummeling the runway.

680
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:03,767
- That face is Iman...
- Yes.

681
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,834

is pure pissed off.

00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,066

I'm serving the judges
pure fish, hunty.

Hi, kids!

Shh.
It's "box"!

00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:01,967
- Cram it in! Yeah!

709
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,233
- Your horse won't fit
in the box!

710
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,367
[kids giggling]

711
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,066
Your horse is just too big
for my pink box!

712
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,800
[kids laughing]

713
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,734
- Look, everybody.
It's Anita Bum!

714
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:16,066
- Today we're gonna learn
how to toss salad

715
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:19,133
with my good friend,
Tasha Salad.

716
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,967
- [lisping] I'm so excited
to be here today.

717
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,333
Well, let's get started.

718
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,500
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.

719
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,400
- Now, is it harmful
to toss a dirty salad?

720
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,266
- Some people are into that.

721
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,367
- Instead of using
the uncut carrots,

722
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,934
can we use the cut carrots?

723
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:37,400
- Yes. What you want to do is
peel the skin back.

724
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Cut carrots always seem
to be cleaner. Okay?

725
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,934
We're tossing salads one person
at a time across America.

726
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:44,934
[kids cheer]

727
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,400
- What's up, Fanny?

728
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,100
- Today I'm going to be...

729
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,600
teaching a social lesson.

730
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,667
Don't be throwing no shade.

731
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,066
- Look, it's everyone's
favorite cross-dresser,

732
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,333
Uncle Dick!

733
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,467
- It's real sunny up here.

734
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,734
But I do like
a little bit of shade.

735
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,266
- Don't be throwing
no shade, sir.

736
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,767
Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?

737
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,734
Sunlight on your skin
creates vitamin D

738
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,467
and elevates the mood, so...

739
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:13,400
all: Don't be shady.

740
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,066
Be a lady.

741
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,533
- Bye-bye, everybody!

742
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,567
- [clucks]

743
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,200
- Bye!

744
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,066
[laughter and applause]

745
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,967
- Next up,<i> The Magic Bush.</i>

746
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:28,166
- My name is Princess Pinklips.

747
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,200
Are you guys excited
for today's episode?

748
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Then let's all bounce.

749
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,800
And now shake your hands
like this.

750
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,633
Ooh, isn't this fun?

751
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,100
Oh!

752
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,633
Today we have a special word of
the day.

753
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,166
The word of the day is...

754
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,633
"blow."

755
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,133
- I always think of bubbles.

756
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:51,166
Now with bubbles,
you really work it.

757
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,700
Just give it your all.

758
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,600
Kind of like an explosion
of bubbles.

759
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,200
- You're so good at blowing,
Jolly Jade.

760
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,133
- Well, I don't have blue lips
for no reason.

761
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,867
[laughter]

762
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:05,667
- Next we're going to welcome
Cherry Chocolatina

763
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,700
and Lola the Exploda.

764
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,800
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.

765
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,967
Now, go ahead
and peel the banana.

766
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,834
-<i> Suavemente, vas a pelar</i>

767
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,967
<i>para atras el guineo.</i>

768
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,066
- Oh.
- Ooh.

769
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,567
- Ooh, Miss Lola's
favorite part is the cream.

770
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,133
- [panting]

771
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,567
Help me, girl.

772
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:26,767
[both panting and murmuring]

773
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,233
- Ooh! Oh!
- Oh!

774
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,800
- Wow.
- It exploded!

775
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,066
- Hello, everyone.

776
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:35,166
I'm T.T.,
and this is my little friend.

777
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,633
- Tiny.

778
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:40,867
- That reminds me.

779
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,200
It's time for
our social lesson of the day.

780
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,233
Always tell the T.

781
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,233
- Is my T my truth?

782
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,433
- Yes, your T is your truth.

783
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,467
Do you have something
that you'd like to say?

784
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:55,867
- Uh-uh.

785
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:59,100
[awkward silence]

786
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,266
[solo clapping]

787
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,567
- All right.

788
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,467
- I think there were
some weak links,

789
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:07,834
but I think there were some weak
links in the other team too.

790
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,867
At least this team's
all in drag.

791
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,500
- Coming up...

792
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,767
- You're gonna get lost,

793
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,600
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.

794
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,033
- This is<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>

795
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,433
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>

796
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:22,467
[laughing]

797
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,967
Ladies, this week
you worked as teams,

798
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:32,233
but tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.

799
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:36,700
When I call your name,
please step forward.

800
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,767
Honey Mahogany.

801
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,900
Ivy Winters.

802
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,433
Jade Jolie.

803
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:45,433
Alyssa Edwards.

804
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,567
Lineysha Sparx.

805
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:51,667
Lineysha, you're lucky
you have immunity.

806
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,700
Otherwise,
you'd be in the bottom.

807
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,333
The girls I've called forward,

808
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,600
you are all safe.

809
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,700
You may leave the stage.

810
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,066
Ladies, you represent
the very best

811
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,367
and the very worst of the week.

812
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,133
It's time for
the judges' critiques.

813
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,133
First up, Alaska.

814
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,066
- Hi.

815
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:20,133
- I love your dust bunny hair,

816
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,166
and I love your
pink splattered blood.

817
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,633
You are such an original.

818
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,133
- Tonight on the runway,
I love it.

819
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm just concerned for you
with the boy-drag.

820
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,567
It is a drag show.

821
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,633
You know, I'm paying my $5.

822
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,967
I want to see Alaska.

823
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,734
- Next up,
Monica Beverly Hillz.

824
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:41,066
- I don't know if
during the<i> Barnyard Bunch</i>

825
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,767
you just got nervous,
but you need to project more,

826
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,100
or you're gonna get lost,

827
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,934
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.

828
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:48,233
- It's inside of you.

829
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,100
I could see that--
that Beverly Hills bitch--

830
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,400
when you walked out.

831
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,533
But then you kind of went
in your shell after a while.

832
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,633
- Thank you, Monica.

833
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,066
Vivienne Pinay.

834
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,500
- Tonight you look really cute.

835
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,533
It's unfortunate that
you created that character

836
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,934
and then that it
kind of fell so flat.

837
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:08,066
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--

838
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,500
you bored me. 

839
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,467
- Moving on to...

840
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,967
♪ Detox ♪

841
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,400
- Your costume wasn't
my favorite part of you.

842
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
It was really just,
like, your jokes

843
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,834
and your mannerisms
and your volume.

844
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,467
- You rock the stage.

845
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,233
You rock it in acting.

846
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,867
I really like the shake
in the boobies.

847
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:28,133
Yeah, thank you.

848
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,233
- I know I had a lot of
competition up here tonight...

849
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,834
- Yes, right?

850
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,734
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

851
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:37,600
- You float above the concrete.

852
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,367
- Thank you.
- I love it.

853
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:42,633
- Tasha salad was freaking

854
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,700
hilar.

855
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,400
- Jinkx Monsoon.

856
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
- Jinkx, you're the North Star
in your little group,

857
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,066
because they would've been lost
without you.

858
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:54,233
Looking like Glenn Close
in<i> Fatal Attraction</i>

859
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,700
for a kids' show?

860
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,433
I mean, that in itself
is completely demented.

861
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,166
- Coco Montrese.

862
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,433
- This was not your challenge.

863
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,667
I can't really tell you why.

864
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,200
- They wanted me
to be a marionette,

865
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,533
and I was just supposed
to answer the question.

866
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,100
And that's not me.

867
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,667
In the show in Vegas, I am the--
I'm the front. I'm the star.

868
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:17,100
- If you are good
at being in the spotlight,

869
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,133
you should know how to steal it.

870
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,433
- There's been a lot on my mind.

871
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,900
- What's on your mind?

872
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,400
- [tearful]
Alyssa's my friend.

873
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,300
We didn't talk for two years.

874
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,967
And...

875
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:36,066
Coming here and seeing her here

876
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,433
completely threw me off.

877
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,467
And I don't feel like
I'm showing you who--

878
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,367
who I really am,

879
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:46,066
'cause I'm better than that.

880
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,734
- I know there's distractions,

881
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,066
but, Coco, keep your head
in the game

882
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,266
and be Coco.

883
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,900
All right, ladies.

884
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,467
I think we've heard enough.

885
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,333
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

886
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,467
the judges and I
will deliberate.

887
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,400
Okay, just between us "goyls,"

888
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
what do you think?

889
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,533
Starting with Roxxxy Andrews.

890
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,166
- She's absolutely a stunner.

891
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,500
The hair color.

892
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,600
J.Lo wishes.
- Yes.

893
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,767
What did you think of her
performance as Tasha Salad?

894
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,567
- There is nothing
more attractive

895
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,066
than seeing a beautiful woman
dare to be ugly.

896
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,133
- Uh-huh.

897
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,900
- I expect some good stuff
out of that one.

898
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,066
- Next up, Alaska.

899
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,667
Now, Michelle, you and I
both looked at each other

900
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,734
when Alaska came out
dressed as a man...

901
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,300
- Mm-hmm.
- And thought, "What the F?"

902
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,166
- It really was
just Pee-wee Herman.

903
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,333
- Yeah, that's true.

904
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,900
- And this is
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>

905
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,100
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>

906
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,200
- Okay.

907
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
- Alaska, to me,
he doesn't stand out.

908
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,900
He's, like, someone I would
hang out with in high school.

909
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,467
- What high school
did you go to?

910
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,467
- Well, I mean, I was
a homeschooler, but, um...

911
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:52,600
[laughter]

912
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,100
- Monica Beverly Hillz.

913
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,233
- Who was she again?

914
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,133
- She played Fanny
the farm hand--sunglasses.

915
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,066
- Oh, well, see,
that's how memorable she was.

916
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,233
- Well, there you go.

917
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,333
- She was such a nervous wreck.

918
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,467
You can never let them
see you sweat.

919
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,066
- She's stopping herself.

920
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,600
- Exactly, the calls are coming
from inside the house.

921
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,066
Vivienne Pinay.

922
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,734
- Anita Bum was forgettable.

923
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,533
- Right,
'cause if she was Anita Bum,

924
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,934
she could've been really hyper,
like, you know, um, yeah, um--

925
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:16,400
She could've gone for it,
you know?

926
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,066
- When I see a Plain Jane,
kind of like her--

927
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,633
'cause she is boring--
I like to do them up.

928
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,200
- Turn her out.
- Turn her out!

929
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,700
That's what I love to do.

930
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,066
- Detox.

931
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,533
- Kids would love watching
Clucky the cock.

932
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:31,734
- I see Faye Dunaway had a child
with Anjelica Huston,

933
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:33,767
and then she lost
all her fashion sense

934
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,700
and started wearing clothes
with holes in them.

935
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,900
- Yes.
- Sorry, Coco.

936
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,567
[laughter]

937
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,934
- Jinkxy Monsoon.

938
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,333
- She got me in the mood.

939
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,567
Like, I was singing with her.
I was raising my hands.

940
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,200
- Oh, right.
- I was a little girl.

941
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,600
- She was the only reason
that team stayed afloat.

942
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,066
- Coco Montrese.

943
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,867
- She had an issue with,
you know,

944
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:55,667
not getting the right part,

945
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,233
but you have to take lemons
and make lemonade.

946
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:00,700
- Blaming your shortcomings
on somebody else?

947
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
- Mm-hmm.

948
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,800
- Please.

949
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,834
- And you know, Santino,

950
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,400
playing the dummy can be

951
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,433
a real scene-stealing role,
right, Michelle?

952
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,100
[laughter]

953
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I mean--

954
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,567
- [guffawing]

955
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,834
- You know I love you, and I
only say it 'cause it's true.

956
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,300
- Yeah.
- I was just telling everybody

957
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,734
how much nicer
you were than Tyra.

958
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:20,333
[laughter]

959
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,166
- Silence.

960
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,333
I've made my decision.

961
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,300
Bring back...

962
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,967
[whispers] My girls.

963
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,066
[laughing]

964
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,500
Welcome back, ladies.

965
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,734
I've made some decisions.

966
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,166
Roxxxy Andrews,

967
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:43,066
your portrayal
of Tasha Salad was,

968
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:47,066
in a word,
[lisping] sensational.

969
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,400
You are safe.

970
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,900
Jinkx Monsoon.

971
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,066
You're safe.

972
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,767
- Thank you.

973
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:58,867
- Monica Beverly Hillz.

974
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:03,400
Your kidster character
was not after-school special.

975
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,333
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

976
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:13,533
Detox, your Clucky the cock...

977
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:16,300
bl-bl-bl-blocked...

978
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,667
The competition.

979
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,300
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

980
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,266
[applause]

981
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:27,767
You've won a wig wardrobe
from new attitude wigs.

982
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,800
- I won the challenge!

983
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,200

984
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,166

[sighs]

986
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:41,667
was a real drag.

987
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,667
You are...

988
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:47,066
safe.

989
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:50,800
Coco, your ventriloquist act

990
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,734
could have been hilarious,

991
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:56,300
but your performance was wooden.

992
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,934
Vivienne Pinay.

993
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,367
America's next drag superstar

994
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,100
has to be more than just pretty.

995
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,166
Much more.

996
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,633
Vivienne...

997
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,967
you...

998
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,800
are safe.

999
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,867
But consider this a warning.

1000
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,800
Coco Montrese,
I'm sorry, my dear,

1001
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,600
but you are up for elimination.

1002
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,066
- I cannot believe
I'm up for elimination.

1003
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,233
Is this really happening?

1004
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:31,100
I'm not ready to go home.

1005
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,633
- Two queens stand before me.

1006
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:38,767
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me

1007
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,633
and save yourself
from elimination.

1008
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:45,200

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,100

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,300
- [mouths words]

1072
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,200
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.

1073
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,166
Coco Montrese...

1074
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,867
Shante, you stay.

1075
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
You may join the other girls.

1076
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,834
- Thank you.

1077
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,934
- Monica,

1078
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:45,133
you came here with a secret.

1079
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,200
And the secret is

1080
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,200
you are fierce and talented.

1081
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Go share that with the world.

1082
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,066
- [crying] Thank you
for believing in me.

1083
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,867
Thank you for seeing something
in me that I never saw.

1084
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:00,867
[sniffles]

1085
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,066
- Thank you.

1086
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,166
- I love you.

1087
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:06,200
Thank you so much.

1088
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,567
- We love you.

1089
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:12,166
Now sashay away.

1090
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,066
- I had a hard time
opening up to the girls.

1091
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:18,667
I've always had that problem.

1092
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,767
It did hold me back
in this competition.

1093
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:22,367
But I am fierce.

1094
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,266
And I need to just step back

1095
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:27,433
and be okay with that.

1096
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:30,900
- 11 queens, 1 crown.

1097
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,967
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1098
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,533
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1099
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,300
Can I get an amen up in here?

1100
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
all: Amen!

1101
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,834
- All right,
now let the music play!

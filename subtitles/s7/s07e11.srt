got a lot of work cut out for them.

165
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,619
Take your Metamucil, girls.
This is gonna be a rough one.

[electronic music playing]

167
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,624
Ugh!

168
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,130
{\an8}We have to create a couture look
entirely out of Hello Kitty materials.

169
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:35,501
I'm all about having concepts
and having them executed flawlessly.

170
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,672
I'm excited to do this fucking challenge.
You have no idea.

171
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:44,610
I'll do black and pink, and then do
my thigh boots and juice them up

172
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,514
with my fishnets
and give that kind of look.

173
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,952
{\an8}I want to make it look sexy,
like, Becky, who's 21 years old

174
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,722
{\an8}with a hot boyfriend
and who have a fetish for Hello Kitty.

175
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,961
-What's your plan?
-I don't know.

176
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,465
I'm into period looks,
and I haven't done a '60s thing yet.

177
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,402
-Oh.
-So I want to go, like, mod.

178
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,506
-What about you?
-I don't know. I have no fucking idea.

179
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:17,043
I could use this to shield
the judges from my horrible outfit.

180
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,680
-Like really fierce.
-Oh, my God. How avant-garde is that?

181
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,383
-It looks so great from the side...
-Yes, Gaga, come through.

182
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,621
Lady Gaga, you look amazing.
Work! Oh, it's Katya.

183
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,290
-We'll get some inspo.
-I'm working on it.

184
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,325
-Maybe I can help.
-Don't pressure me!

185
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:38,798
Katya has relied on humor her whole life.
Presenting a fashion thing is a struggle.

186
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,601
She has so much talent,
and I just wish she would focus.

187
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,338
-You have something I don't have.
-Beauty?

188
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,409
You have this hairy mole on your back.

189
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,716
No, you have this unshakeable confidence.

190
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,051
-I so admire that.
-Thank you.

191
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,555
Drag is all about confidence, I feel.
That's why I like it.

192
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,858
{\an8}I'm gonna try to absorb
a bit of Violet's confidence.

193
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,060
This is my confident face.

194
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,831
[hinges squeak]

195
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,569
-Hello, hello, hello. Look who's back.
-[all] Hi!

196
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,307
-[Violet] Oh, my God!
-[Kennedy] Oh, my goodness!

197
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:27,379
It's Santino. He's here to help you
with your Hello Kitty eleganza.

198
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:33,285
Santino Rice walks through that door,
and I flood my basement, bitch.

199
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,722
That is one sexy man.

200
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,694
Newark. LaGuardia. Kennedy.
This looks gorgeous, these little bows.

201
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,330
-I'm accessorizing with the bows.
-Uh-huh.

202
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,900
I'm dying that their bows are gone.

203
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:52,271
-I want to know what's Kennedy's style.
-Kennedy is a catsuit queen.

204
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,340
-I'm an entertainer. I dance, so...
-Yeah.

205
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,909
-Do you know how to make a catsuit?
-No.

206
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,744
Oh. Okay.

207
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,480
Like somebody who love enchiladas
but don't know how to make 'em.

208
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,418
In my head I'm like, "I am not creative,
but what do you want to do?"

209
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:11,290
You are creative. That's why you're here.
So let's see something.

210
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,560
Get back to work. I cannot wait
to see what you come up with.

211
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,095
Thank you very much.

212
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,431
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.

213
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,934
-Hi. Meet Santino.
-Hi, Santino.

214
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,903
-Hey, how are you?
-You look so dapper.

215
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,037
Thank you.

216
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,308
Now, I wanted you to meet Santino

217
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,814
because he also studied fashion,
knew all of the silhouettes.

218
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,250
-Do you have any questions for Santino?
-Can we go to Red Lobster?

219
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:45,791
I want to do something kind of...
bubblegum pop mod meets Harajuku.

220
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,528
Everything you described to us
is really incredible.

221
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,832
This boning you're using,
that's for your head?

222
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,869
[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness. Wow.

223
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,710
Violet looks like the human gaydar, bitch.
What the hell?

224
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,213
Now, you've set the standard really high.

225
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,883
-Let's see something amazing out of you.
-I will do my very best.

226
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,352
All right, get to work,
and we'll see you out there.

227
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,623
-Hi, Katya.
-Hi.

228
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,294
You won the challenge last week.
How will you keep the momentum going?

229
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,663
I'm just-- I don't know.

230
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,901
I have no idea what I'm doing.

231
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:33,205
If you start doing something,
it will lead you to where you need to be.

232
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,142
But if it stays in your head,
you're not gonna get out of the gate.

233
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,380
I would say first and foremost,
if you can somehow incorporate Hello Kitty

234
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,651
into who Katya is,
you're gonna be all right.

235
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,555
-Listen. The clock is running out. Okay?
-Make it work.

236
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:54,927
I don't want to fuck up this challenge,
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

237
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,533
-Hey, Pearl.
-Hi, RuPaul. Hi, Santino.

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,604
-So, <i>flazéda</i>.
-<i>Flazéda</i>. It's the new hashtag.

239
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,941
-It's spreading like wildfire.
-It sure is. It's all the rage.

240
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,912
-Did you make that up?
-I guess so. I thought it was a real word.

241
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,681
-Maybe I thought of it in a dream.
-Yeah.

242
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,351
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't make it any less real, Pearl.

243
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,388
What can Pearl bring to this challenge?

244
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:27,426
Maybe some sort of pooled skirt,
maybe even like a hobble dress.

245
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,195
-[RuPaul] Very <i>flazéda</i>.
-Very that.

246
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,935
-The skirt's gonna be out of this blanket?
-This plush, yeah.

247
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,571
{\an8}I'm interested to see
how Pearl's gonna do with this,

248
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:44,743
{\an8}because she is always long,
drapey and flowing.

249
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,014
None of this fabric
is particularly long, drapey, or flowing.

250
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,685
Hello Kitty, good-bye, Pearl.

251
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,089
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi.

252
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,591
You don't sew?

253
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,562
-No. I don't.
-How far along are you in this?

254
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,734
-I cut out this panel so far.
-That can be a problem, Ginger.

255
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,005
-You've been in the bottom two twice.
-And both of those design challenges.

256
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,575
Do you have
a foundation garment that you wear?

257
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,511
I have shorts with the hips
and the ass built into them.

258
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,547
-And you cinch your waist or...
-I don't.

259
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,150
When I first started drag,
my drag mother said to me,

260
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:29,822
"It looks stupid when big girls corset
and got stuff bubbling here and there."

261
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,992
If you make something for your body,

262
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,428
it will accentuate the positives
and eliminate the negatives.

263
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:41,367
I would really encourage you
to cinch in your shape a little bit.

264
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,470
You look a little defeated here.

265
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,942
-I'm trying to figure out my next move.
-Well, we're running out of time here.

266
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
So get to work and let those juices flow.

267
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,716
I want to crawl underneath
the workstation and fucking die.

268
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,454
All right, ladies, gather around.

269
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,893
Tomorrow, Santino will be back
on the judges' panel to let you have it.

270
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,431
So good luck, and don't...
Wait a minute, wait.

271
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,401
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.

272
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,572
Oh, pit crew!

[RuPaul] In addition
to your Hello Kitty eleganza,

275
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,917
you need to create a second look.

276
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,389
That's right, you need
to turn yourself into a character

277
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,727
that Hello Kitty would be proud
to call her new BFF.

278
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:50,002
And by all means, help yourself
to supplies from the Fabric Planet wall.

Ah... Fucking fuck.

00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,016
-Good luck, and...
-[both] Don't fuck it up.

and say,

-[Pearl] You can't see?

291
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,883
-[Ginger] I can't see.
-[Violet] You can't see shit.

-[Violet] We have to walk like this.

[Ginger] How? Oh, my God.

294
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,627
{\an8}It's really impossible
to try to serve face in this head.

295
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,396
What kind of nose
does a cow have?

296
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,065
Like a snout.

297
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,834

how the hell I'm gonna pull this off.

Oh, my gosh. Okay. So...

-Gorgeous.

I'm okay.

The other girls have no idea
what's happening in my mind right now

307

because I am a master
of hiding my turbulent emotions,

I'm pleased with my look so much.

I think it's flawless.
How's yours coming, Katya?

Um, well...

-The one.

on my Hello Kitty BFF character,

-<i>Privyet</i>.

477
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,991
For your BFF, loved your voice-over.

478
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:57,462
I loved that you added
some international flavor to the Meow Mix.

479
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,734
Then we have the look, the eleganza.
I'm a bit confused by it

480
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,171
because the hair to me
doesn't go with the outfit.

481
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:11,009
You're giving us hot futuristic
space mom who loves Hello Kitty.

482
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,410
[laughter]

483
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,979
-Was that it?
-Get out of my head.

484

coerced into prostitution

485
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,887
on her way to fashion week in Chernobyl.

486
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:29,027
You could've taken it even further,
gotten your point of view across better.

487
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,829
Thank you, Katya.

488
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:35,533
Next up, Newark. LaGuardia.
Kennedy Davenport.

489
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,738
On the runway, it's a miss for me.
It's basic what you did on the bodysuit.

490
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,676
[Santino] To cut out all these bows
and then sew them on in rows.

491
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,945
I thought you were doing
an amazing flourish.

492
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:52,750
The challenge was to stick
to who we are, and this is me.

493
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:57,422
It could be a bit more adventuresome
for you to try some more daring looks.

494
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,826
That transferred over to your BFF.
It was a little bit sassy.

495
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,797
-But it wasn't enough for me.
-What kept you from going further with it?

496
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,133
I wish I had
some creativity like these ladies.

497
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,737
Actually, you do.
And that's why it's strange for us.

498
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,541
Because we see you in a way
that you're clearly not seeing yourself.

499
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:22,080
Well, thank you, ladies.
While you go untuck backstage,

500
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,449
the judges and I will deliberate.

501
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,687
For tonight's deliberation,
we have an extra special guest.

502
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,024
Just between us kitty girls,
what do you think?

503
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,760
Let's start with Violet Chachki.

504
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:41,900
Her Hello Violet character
was more tame than her extravaganza look.

505
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,403
I actually appreciated that she was
a little tame on her Hello Violet

506
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,440
because you are dealing
with such an iconic brand like that.

507
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:55,747
Her Hello Kitty couture was fabulous.
She really delivers what we've asked for.

508
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:00,518
She has a great eye for proportion.
Violet's a creative powerhouse.

509
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:06,491
She has a million silhouettes in her head,
and she's brought it to us every time.

510
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:10,028
-Why are you gagging so?
-She bring it to you, every ball.

511
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,898
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Her BFF look was amazing.

512
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:18,670
She's very detail-oriented.
I don't have any beefs with this look.

513
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:23,875
It really moo-ved me.
It worked beautifully with the brand.

514
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,812
That being said, I was not blown away
by the Hello Kitty couture.

515
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,316
I would've liked to have seen
some more whimsicality.

516
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,818
How could she be more whimsical?
She had hair, ears,

517
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,721
<i>a bow in her head,</i>
<i>stuffed animals on her boobs.</i>

518
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,358
-That's not whimsical enough?
-Are we talking about Ginger or you?

519
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,527
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>

520
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:49,167
She created for her couture look
a glamorous, dramatic, plushy character.

521
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,169
It's a wraparound blanket.

522
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,772
Only somebody who weighs
82 pounds wet could pull that look off,

523
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,542
where you could wear a blanket
and call it a dress.

524
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,045
<i>Hello Kitty BFF.</i>
<i>The Madonna vibe made me so happy.</i>

525
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,647
She was having fun,

526
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,684
which is a really big deal for Pearl,
who always looks like she's half-asleep.

527
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,587
-But Kitty wouldn't hang out with her.
-And shoplift.

528
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,991
So, Hello Kitty,
would you hang out with Hello Pearl?

529
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,859
[RuPaul] No, no...

530
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,562
[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>

531
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:22,266
I loved her Hello Kitty BFF.
It was so wrong, it was strong.

532
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,171
It was hilarious and irreverent,
and I think drag should do that.

533
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:32,744
There's no way Hello Kitty's allowed
to hang out with this Russian hooker.

534
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,314
Hello Kitty, would you hang out
with an older Russian woman

535
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,584
who smokes cigarettes from Siberia?

536
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,553
[Santino] Oh. Oh, wow. Maybe. Huh.

537
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,691
The eleganza. I didn't like it at all.
None of it went together.

538
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,328
I actually get what she was going for
with the hairdo and the pearls.

539
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,831
I thought it looked like futuristic,
like, Jetsons.

540
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,868
[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.

541
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,605
Her character, it never delivered.
She had an idea that just fizzled.

542
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:07,645
Her look was a basic ho-stroll outfit.
She just glued bows and pincushions.

543
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:12,417
You're gonna mutilate a hundred
Hello Kitty dolls and take their bows off,

544
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,453
and you're gonna use them like that?
No, you're not.

545
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,390
Ask Hello Kitty what she thought about
how she used all those bows.

546
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,759
Silence!

547
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,265
I've made my decision.
Bring back my litter.

548
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,403
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your Hello Kitty presentations,

549
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,372
I've made some decisions.

550
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,908
Pearl...

551
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,644
you're safe.

552
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,714
Kennedy Davenport,
your round-the-way girl

553
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,284
could've used more twirl.

554
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,022
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

555

you were a real glamor-puss.

you are the winner of this challenge.

557

559

Thank God.

{\an8}I'm the winner,
and I feel it was well goddamn deserved.

561

a hold of this challenge and milked it

562
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,394
for all it was worth.

563
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,599

like, illiterate. Whatever.
I've never seen <i>Macbeth</i>.

170
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,024
Okay. I think I'm ready to assign.

171
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:23,629
Lady MacBitch, the pretty one,
the ambitious, ruthless wannabe mean girl.

172
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,765
That sounds like Violet.

173
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,100
[laughter]

174
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,736
Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. [laughs]

175
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,272
-The tough ghetto woman.
-I don't want to be the ghetto girl.

176
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:39,011
Because that's, like, so common. I could
really turn myself into Lady MacBitch.

177
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,147
-Lady MacBitch?
-Yes.

178
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,550
I kind of don't want
to put people in their, like...

179
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,319
-Comfort zone?
-Yeah.

180
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,089
So, Violet, I would like
for you to be ghetto.

181
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,127
We have an hour to get this down,
so we need to figure it out.

182
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:59,599
Yeah, it's figured out.
You Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. Okay?

183
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,970
Her and Jasmine are friends, that's why
Jasmine has the role of MacBitch,

184
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,404
even though it is perfect for me.

185
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,008
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, Boo-boo.

186
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,345
<i>There's no pleasing Violet</i>
<i>if it doesn't go her way.</i>

187
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,147
She always has a stank face.

188
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,916
She's just a bitch.

189
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,519
{\an8}So this is some Shakespeare shit.

190
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,090
{\an8}This week's main challenge is to act

191
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,727
{\an8}in a new adaptation
of a Shakespearian classic.

192
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,830
I'm so excited.
I've done Shakespeare plenty...

193
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,531

{\an8}I do have, like,
some legitimate Shakespearian experience.

196
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,209
-So let's go through the characters.
-Do you have a 30-day trial?

197
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,146
Attention, please. Everyone, when I have
my hands up like this, attention.

198
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,886
All right, kittens. Lady Cappuccino,
Juliet's drag mother, a little older.

199
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,522
-I think I know who that one sounds like.
-[laughs]

200
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,292
Juliet's BFF, a vapid, ditsy party girl.

201
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,962
Let's see how many lines she has,
then we'll talk.

202
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,364
Mercutia, she's more ratchet,
kind of a hoochie.

203
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,201
-See, I think you should be Mercutia.
-Come on, house...

204
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,238
-Capulet. Is that correct?
-House Capulet, yeah.

205
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,473
-Capu... Capulet.
-Capulet. Exactly.

206
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,709
I don't know what that means.

207
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,645
-You're, like, totes montage-eau.
-Montague.

208
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,614
Monta-goo.

209
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:26,152
{\an8}Some of these girls look like
their Shakespeare is gonna be shaky, dear.

210
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,687
Montag-ew!

211
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,656
Ew!

212
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,862
{\an8}This is so not your gig.

213
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,699
{\an8}When you go:
"This is so not your gig," you be like...

-So not your gig.
-This is so... not your gig.

215
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,104
Sound like more Regina George.

216
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,108
{\an8}Jasmine has the role of MacBitch
and it's, like, a really sassy, bitchy...

217
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,976
This is so not your gig.

218
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,746
She's not really serving that.

219
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,981
Basic bitches not wanted.

220
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,653
I get the ghetto girl
and I'm serving it well.

221
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,491
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanni. That's right.

222
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,598
The struggle is real. Um...

223
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,803
I want to make a judgment call here
because I just don't feel comfortable.

224
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,741
I need Jasmine and Violet
to switch characters.

225
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,312
Jasmine, just be the ghetto girl
and make it work.

226
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,949
Bitch, I already gone done
filled my ghetto fantasy.

227

Let's switch scripts.

228
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,653
So because of Jasmine's fucking up
we should change quick?

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,056
We should definitely
run through it right now.

230
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,292
No, no. Just read on your own.

00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,518
[gasps]

489
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:05,824
Oh, man. We never even got to kaikai.

490
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:11,162
And with this death drop, I do die.

491
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,931
[moans]

492
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,132
Romy, girl!

493
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,168
Why?

494
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,273
Teenage suicide...

495
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,109
Don't do it.

496
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,247
[sniffles] I just...
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

497
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,315
[laughter]

498
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,785
Well done, ladies. Next up, <i>MacBitch</i>.

499
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,354
Starring Team Kennedy Davenport.

500
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,059
[Renaissance music playing]

501
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,496
Here in Tuckahoe,
it's the season of the witch... [sniffs]

502
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,600
but none are as shady as Lady MacBitch.
[laughter]

503
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,569
Friends, drag queens, hunty men.

504
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,605
[blows the whistle]

505
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,143
I got something to say.
Cheerleading tryouts are happening today.

506
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,079
Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna

507
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,083
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanna. That's right!

508
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,986
Girl, not on tonight.
This is so not your gig.

509
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,523
I'm lady MacBitch
and you're a pig in a wig.

510
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,627
Hey, Hogwarts rejects,
what's your prediction?

511
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,164
If I'm not head cheerleader,
it's purely fan fiction.

512
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,600
The spirits have spoken.
We saw in a dream.

513
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,638
Lady MacBitch is the cheer team supreme.

514
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,306
Wicked, please.

515
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,047
Attention, cheer trolls.
Let the tryouts begin.

516
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:41,352
Start your engines.
May the best Tuckahoe win!

517
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:48,426
-Basic witches not wanted.
-Oh, sisters, I'm stressed.

518
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,495
If I don't win, I may die.

519
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,798
Try this. It'll help.
It's Oprah's new chai.

520
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,835
[whispering] With a shot of drain cleaner.

521
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,672
Well, all right, Mary MacBitch.
Give it a go. You're up first.

522
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:06,311
Okay. Give me a T. Give me a U.
Give me a...

523
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,379
[gags]

524
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,448
Byeeeee!

525
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,318
[blows the whistle]

526
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,889
U-G-L-Y. You ain't got no alibi. You ugly.

527
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,457
Tragic.

528
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,092
[dramatic music playing]

529
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,500
Well, there you have it, ladies,
master-queef theater.

530
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:33,571
{\an8}It was hard to watch.
I'm trying to black it out.

531
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:41,312
The reviews are in, and one production
are all safe from elimination.

532
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,950
Team Max, condragulations.

533
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,520
-Good work, guys.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce,

534
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:52,123
-kudos for working through your fears.
-Thank you, Ru.

535
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:57,195
And for your dual role as team leader

536
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,665
and the tallest Juliet in herstory,

537
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,801
Max, you are the winner
of the challenge.

538
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,736
[applause]

539
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,106
You've won two couture latex outfits

540
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,976
<i>from Syren Latex,</i>
<i>a leader in latex fashions.</i>

541
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,413
{\an8}This is the perfect ending
to a good week. It feels grand.

542
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,184
Now, get thee to a nunnery.

543
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,452
[electronic music playing]

544
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,724
Team Kennedy Davenport,

545
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,128
you are all up for elimination.

546
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,767
-First up, Kennedy.
-I have to say, the runway outfit

547
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,937
is probably my least favorite
of all of the contestants.

548
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,272
-Oh!
-Your performance...

549
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,376
the fact that you were the team leader
and your team was a disaster.

550
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,947
-What the hell happened?
-It was a shock to me as well.

551
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,983
During your rehearsal,
couldn't you sense

552
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,119
-that it wasn't even going right?
-Nobody knew their lines.

553
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,088
Well, that was pretty evident.

554
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,092
-Moving on. Katya.
-You knew your lines.

555
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,028
You delivered it okay
and for this group, it's a lot.

556
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,464
Your choice on the runway
shows intelligent humor.

557
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,100
The hair, the beard,
the whole entire look...

558
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,936
-Flawless for me.
-Thank you.

559
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,640
All right, Jasmine Masters.
Oh, what a gorgeous gown!

560
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,842
-Thank you.
-You just look unbelievable,

561
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,978
and I'm sure the dress weighs 100 pounds.

562
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,648
-Yes, it does.
-Your beard is the most disturbing to me,

563
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,751
-and it looks like a chin strap.
-I don't glue stuff to my face.

564
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,421
The slightest thing will break me out.
I didn't want to take that chance

565
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:35,627
and put something on my face and going
to the hospital because my skin broke out.

566
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:42,767
Your Shakespearean performance wasn't fun
to watch, we could kind of see

567
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,303
-that you were having a hard time.
-I knew my lines,

568
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,405
but they didn't come out
how they should.

569
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,806
You did not know your lines.

570
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,610
Next up, Pearl.

571
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,546
Your look makes a statement,
and you're the only one

572
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,849
that used
some really creative materials.

573
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,652
You were a cheerleading coach,

574
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:05,089
and you were, like, lifeless
and borderline dead.

575
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,926
I like borderline dead. I find it great.

576
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,195
-Once.
-I've only seen it once.

577
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,866
I mean, it was rough.
The domino effect was real.

578
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,367
But you had the first word.

579
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,836
So if you have a domino effect,
you started it.

580
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah. Sorry. Thanks.

581
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,109
-Next up, Kandy Ho.
-Hello.

582
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,078
Yay on the contouring.

583
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:31,549
Don't think I haven't noticed.
You changed your face and it shows.

584
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,952
-Thank you.
-It's pretty, and now we see you.

585
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,888
-Isn't it funny?
-That's the irony, she wears a beard.

586
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,725
-For the beard challenge...
-She fixes her contour.

587
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:45,630
I liked the nerdy kind of twist you did
with the tape on the glasses.

588
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,466
-I think you did a fantastic job.
-Thank you.

589
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,570
Next up, Violet Chachki.
I love that Dior silhouette, girl.

590
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,574
You look very elegant and pretty,
and that's hard to do with a full beard.

591
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,742
[RuPaul laughs] Yeah.

592
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,079
Lady MacBitch just fell flat.

593
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,848
How can anyone be crap at being a bitch?

594
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,117
It was a hard day for everybody.

595
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,685
Why is everyone saying a rough day?

596
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,387
Haven't we had days when we just

597
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:13,191
have to pull it out
and just deal with it and be professional?

598
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,526
Um...

599
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,930
I'll say this. I specifically remember
turning to Kennedy

600
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,434
and saying: "Should we run it as a group?"
And she shot me down and said:

601
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,570
"No," and that was
the root of our problem.

602
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:29,407
I'll take responsibility as a leader.

603
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,811
But as far as taking correction,
I'm not gonna take their blame.

604
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,216
You know, FYI,
for all of you girls up there,

605
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,252
I don't want to hear any god damn excuses.

606
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,555
-Be prepared!
-We didn't have time to re-rehearse.

607
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,791
Make it work. Make it work.

608
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,295
Fucking make it happen! I don't want
to hear any goddamn excuses anymore!

609
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,566
[sighs]

610
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,504
Having said that, my children,

611
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:05,543
while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.

612
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,480
Just between us, spice girls,
what do you think?

613
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,150
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.

614
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,520
It looked like she had some pubes
that she glued to her face

615
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,688
-and that was it.
-As a performer...

616
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,291
-Thesbian.
-As a thesp... thesbian...

617
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,961
-I heard that about you.
-What a mistake to not run

618
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,598
-the play as a group.
-It was a mess

619
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,435
from top to bottom.
I don't like messy bottoms.

620
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,736
[laughter]

621
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,506
-[Rupaul]<i> Katya.</i>
-She was consistently delivering.

622
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,676
I think she's always ready,
willing, and abe-le.

623
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,144
[laughs]

624
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,481
-[RuPaul]<i> Jasmine Masters.</i>
-As a fan of the show,

625
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,883
the biggest fan of all time,
it's so frustrating

626
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,587
<i>when you watch someone talented</i>
<i>get in their own way so much</i>

627
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,490
-and they can't pull out of it.
-You have to make it work.

628
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,058
Work. Work it out.

629
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,762
I don't know what it is,
but I really like Jasmine.

630
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,867
[RuPaul] All right.
Let's move on to Pearl.

631
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:07,638
Her role... I think she was trying
to be, like, a couture football player.

632
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,408
[Michelle] <i>The pants had</i>
<i>this gaping crotch that kept</i>

633
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,110
-grabbing my eyes.
-I saw that. Yeah.

634
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,946
Then, when her lines came,
it was like, "Hark.

635
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,948
-Who goes there?"
-[laughter]

636
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,717
This performance
brought to you by Lithium.

637
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,018
[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>

638
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,255
This will sound shocking,
but I actually enjoyed her hairy box.

639
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,057
-[laughter]
-[Carson] <i>Immensely.</i>

640
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,194
She did seem like one of the only people
having a good time.

641
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,097
-She's an enigma.
-Wait, what did you call me?

642
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,100
-[laughter]
-You better watch it.

643
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,037
-[RuPaul]<i> Violet Chachki.</i>
-I don't want to be a MacBitch about it.

644
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,874
However, she is the one
I remember the least.

645
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,945
Come on.
We can all be a bitch. She wasn't.

646
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,514
-Rude.
-[Michelle laughs]

647
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,283
Silence! I've made my decision.

648
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,254
Bring back my shakes-beards.

649
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,358
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

650
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,161
Kandy Ho...

651
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,295
You're safe.

652

Jasmine Masters,
your Shakespeare performance

was a tragedy.

Wake up, Pearl.

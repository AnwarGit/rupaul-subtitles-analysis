- You know the law.
13 glamazons enter,
one drag superstar leaves.
Let the Thunderdome begin!
-<i> Tonight on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's</i>
Drag Race: Reunited!
<i>Our 13 drag warriors return</i>
<i>to battle it out...</i>
- I'm the Charlie Sheen
of drag.
Duh, winning.
-<i> Set the record straight...</i>
- I was never trying
to sabotage you.
- You could have simply rolled
some marbles out there
and just called it a day.
- Bam.
-<i> And let each other have it.</i>
- Did I talk shit?
Absolutely.
We know our names
aren't Heather,
even though they're
right here on our neck.
- If this is the face
of Booger,
I think it's sickening.
-<i> Plus, the queens turn</i>
<i>the tables on Michelle Visage.</i>
- You're a bitch, Michelle.
You bought your titties too.
-<i> And we announce</i>
<i>the fans' choice</i>
for this season's
Miss Congeniality.
<i>The drag race may be over,</i>
<i>but the real drama</i>
<i>is just getting started.</i>
- Welcome to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
You've watched it,
they've lived it,
and now the whole family's
back together
to work it out.
Release the kraken.
These first two fierce queens
came to win, but sadly,
they were gone too soon.
Please welcome back
Venus D-Lite and Phoenix.
Pose. Now vogue.
Rising from the ashes.
The last time we saw
these two queens together,
one was head and shoulders
above the other.
Please welcome back Mimi Imfurst
and India Ferrah.
Pose.
Pose, I said.
Up next,
the belle of the ballroom.
From Hotlanta, GA,
and we call this queen Mariah.
Don't be throwing no shade.
She just wants to get paid.
- Well, hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Now I've dedicated the song
you've just heard
to you and all my girls,
and it just so happens to be
the title track
off my new album,<i> Glamazon,</i>
available on iTunes.
Now speaking of glamazons,
how are you,
Miss Venus D-Lite?
- I'm great.
How are you?
- Fantastic.
It's great to see you.
- It's great to see you too.
- Now, being the first girl
to go...
- Uh-huh.
- Must really suck.
- To be honest, it's actually
been a mixed blessing
because, um,
since after the show, um,
it made people
even more interested in me
because they really did get
to see a lot of me.
- Now, it was revealed
during the show
that you had some work done
to look like Madonna.
- Yes. Uh-huh.
- Would you go further with it?
- I've had some
since I've been gone.
- Really?
- I have.
- What'd you have done?
- Um, just a little more
facial work.
Just a little here and there.
- Injections?
- Injections.
- Would you consider having
a little mini Lourdes created?
- You know what?
When Madonna fades out
and Lourdes becomes famous,
I think that's gonna be
my next solution,
and, um, I naturally
have brown eyes, so...
- Oh, really?
I naturally have
a brown eye too.
- Ooh!
- Well.
- Well, well, well.
- Now, having watched
the rest of the season at home,
which one of the challenges
would you have rocked?
- The Snatch Game.
- So can I put you on the spot
and give you
a Snatch Game question?
- Okay.
- For Madonna?
- It's my turn.
- Okay.
Dumb Dora is so dumb,
she thinks a Kardashian
is a blank.
- She thinks a Kardashian
is my next deejay boyfriend.
Deejay Kardashian.
- [laughs]
Fabulous, Madonna.
Lady Phoenix.
- Yes, Ru.
- Now, watching at home,
were you shocked
by your performance
as Lady Ta-Ta in the
drag queens from outer space?
- Well, you know, I've never
claimed to try to win an Oscar,
so, you know, I mean--
- How about a Golden Globe?
- I mean, possibly.
- NAACP Image Award?
So what did you think
when you saw yourself?
- Because I've never been in
front of the camera like this,
you know, they kept screaming
at me to cheat the camera,
cheat the camera,
and I'm like,
"What the fuck?
I don't cheat on anybody."
I'm like, "what is going on?"
So, you know, it was really
like--really confusion.
- All right.
Mimi Imfurst.
- Hey, Ru.
- In the now legendary
lip-synch for your life...
- Oh, yes.
- When you threw India
over your shoulders...
What was going through your head
at the time?
- Well, I had been doing it
in my show for ten years.
You know, I've probably picked
up over 1,000 people.
Uh, I've never dropped anyone.
It's just something I do.
Like, some girls do splits
or death drops,
and that's what I do.
The stakes there seemed so high.
It's not you're lip-synching
for Mariah Carey's
<i>Glitter</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album, you know?</i>
You're lip-synching
for your life,
and it feels like
if you fail at this, you know,
you're gonna reach over
from behind your table,
reach in your Prada purse,
and pull out a gun,
and that's the end.
- Well, thank God you didn't
have a Prada purse.
- No, no.
- How did it feel?
What was going
through your head?
- [scoffs]
Craziness.
Like, it was just so out
of the blue, like, unexpected.
I was trying to perform,
and she would just,
like, move in front of me,
and I said,
"Okay, I want the judges
to see me."
Only way that y'all could see me
was to go down to the judges,
and in a split second,
I was seeing
the whole rest of the girls
in the back of the thing,
and I didn't know
what was going on.
Get her off of me!
I said, "Okay, I'm up
on this bitch's shoulder.
Like, what just happened?"
- I understand
it was over the top,
and it--it--you know,
and people--
there were people
who thought it was
the worst thing in the world,
there are people
who thought it was entertaining.
- Right, well, I want to ask
the other queens,
do you think it was entertaining
or was it over the line?
- In a show in New York,
you know, that's--that's okay.
You know, it's fun,
it's part of--
but, you know,
this is my chance.
- I can't say that I probably
wouldn't have bopped you, girl.
- Yeah, I think that also.
- 'Cause there's no screaming,
"Get me down, honey."
I'm gonna get myself down.
- And, India, what would you
have done differently?
- Actually, there was nothing
that I could have done
differently,
'cause I think
if I was anywhere else,
she still
would have done that.
Me as an entertainer,
I was there,
performing for you all.
Like, I paid no attention
to her,
other than her blocking me.
So I think
she should have done the same,
and she should have just gave it
her all at that moment.
- I respect that,
and I totally think--
I totally think
if I was in your position,
I would feel the same way.
Just to be clear, I was never
trying to sabotage you.
Like, it was for me,
it was like,
"What can I do to shake this up?
What can I do to make it
different?"
- In lip-synch for your life,
there is a certain
sort of fairness.
You're up to perform,
and if your focus
is to just get in the way
of the other girl...
- Right.
- It's not really
that professional.
- Isn't it a competition?
- You could have simply rolled
some marbles out there
and just called it a day.
- Yeah.
- No.
- So let's move on.
- Actually, I have
a little gift for India.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Oh, goodness.
- Is it ticking?
- Does it have bullets in it?
- It's not ticking at all.
I got India Ferrah
this lovely shirt that says,
"I got picked up
by Mimi Imfurst,
and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt!"
- All right, now, India.
- Hi.
- Were you surprised when you
sashayed away when you did?
- I thought my time
was cut short.
I think two of the challenges,
I wasn't able to show
who I was as a person
or entertainer
due to the, um, duties
that I was given
from Carmen Carrera.
- By the way,
you did say duty.
- Oh, duty.
I'm sorry, duty.
- So what do you mean?
- The workout challenge.
- Right.
- Um, with the rubber band.
We're gonna lower it down,
ladies.
One, two, three, four.
- So the rubber thingamajiggie
prevented us
from seeing
your real personality?
- Absolutely, yeah.
- [laughs]
- Like...
[both laughing]
- Really?
- Yeah.
Like, where could I go
with a rubber thingamajiggie?
- Well, if you know,
the other girl won the challenge
with the thingamajiggie.
- Yeah, with the lip gloss.
Yeah, that's very true.
I just wasn't clever enough
at that moment
to pull out a thing
of lip gloss or eat chicken.
- [laughing]
Now, I gotta say,
I'm hearing a lot
of excuses right now.
- Well, that's what I do, Ru.
- [laughing]
- I laid 'em out,
card by card.
- So had there been a challenge
about excuses,
you would have...
- Well, like, every challenge
after I got kicked off,
I would have succeeded in.
Like, I'm not even lying.
Like the cake challenge,
because I sew,
sew all my costumes
and gowns and stuff,
so I would have definitely
succeeded in that.
- You would have ate that.
- Yeah, I would have ate it up.
- Well, that's the thing.
That's the thing
about this competition.
It's almost like
a roll of the dice.
- Right.
- You've basically got to be
a jack of all trades.
- Exactly.
- Mariah aka Mariah Paris
aka Mariah Balenciaga
aka Mariah Successful.
Now, before you came here--
of course, you did balls,
uh, and the ballroom scene
down in Atlanta.
- Yes, I do balls.
- We've all done balls.
- Now, do you think
being a ballroom queen and,
uh, and not being
a nightclub girl,
uh, put you at a disadvantage
in the competition?
- Um, yeah, it did,
a little bit,
because I don't do it
every week.
The changing, the transition.
I also don't have to learn
lyrics.
- Oh, you're talking about
your lip sync now, aren't you?
- Well, yes.
That was my disadvantage.
- [laughs]
Because you saw the lip sync,
there wasn't a lot
of lip-syncing to the--
- No.
- But you--
- But I-I-I will mug
the shit out of you, though.
- She was.
- Baby.
- Plugs for days, girl.
- Okay?
I will mug the shit
out of you.
- Well, what do you do
when you don't know the lyrics?
- You know what?
I just study BeBe Zahara Benet.
- [laughs]
- You move your lips enough,
and they'll think
that you are turning it.
- [laughing]
What kind of fan mail
have you gotten?
- I've gotten
so many touching letters
about people who were inspired
by my confidence.
They know drag queens,
we go through a lot
of adverse experiences in life
and we still walk around
with our heads held high.
There was this one young girl,
she went through
a tragic experience,
and she felt the need
to reach out
and just tell me her story
and get it out.
Just the fact that me just being
who I am impacted somebody,
it was very touching.
There's no words.
- These next two queens
supersize our love of drag.
Give it up
for Miss Stacy Layne Matthews
and Miss Delta Work!
Uh-oh!
Work!
Be a lady!
- In a year of firsts,
this queen returned to take
the competition by storm.
Please welcome
Shangela Laquifa Wadley!
Ooh, child!
Hallelu!
- Now, when these two queens
lip-synched for their lives,
neither one of them
sashayed away.
Please welcome back
Carmen Carerra
and Yara Sofia.
<i>Echa pa'lante!</i>
Yo, Jersey!
Sickness.
- Well, hey, girls.
Let's kick it.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Hello.
- From Back Swamp,
North Carolina.
Now, how has doing<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
changed your life?
- Oh, I'm like the local,
um, Oprah Winfrey
of Back Swamp now, so...
- Really?
- I go outside, you know,
walk out my door,
and, like, my cousins,
and like, "Oh, my God, hey!
Hey, girl, oh, my God!
It's Stacy!"
I'm like, "Honey,
it's still me, honey."
- [laughs]
Do you have any beef
with any of the other queens?
- Um, when I first watched
a show,
I was pretty upset
with a lot of things
a lot of people had to say,
especially Delta.
I love her,
but there was one point
where you said I shouldn't
have been in the competition
from the beginning.
- I want to be here with people
that I think are the fiercest
in competition
so that when I win,
I can feel like I had a victory
over people who were
just as strong as me.
And I don't think
you're just as strong as me.
- You barely knew
anything about me,
and those things,
you know, really hurt
when you said that.
- I apologize if they hurt,
I really do.
Did I read?
Absolutely.
Did I talk shit?
Absolutely.
But my intention wasn't
to hurt someone's feelings.
This is a sorority
and a fraternity
at the same time.
Part of drag is sitting back
and talking shit.
"Girl, you got that big old wig
on again?"
But did I think
I was more cut out
for the competition
from the outset?
I did think so.
Obviously I was wrong,
because you were winning
before I was.
- Did you find out
anything new about yourself
that you didn't know?
- I did.
I found out that maybe I,
on some level,
I could have been more
of a "lady" like Stacy.
I mean, I could learn a lot
from Stacy.
Sometimes when I answer
people's questions,
it's probably better
to tell them
what they want to hear,
not what I really think.
Because honestly,
at the end of the day,
maybe the high road
would have been to just say,
"Yes, I think
you look beautiful.
Yes, I think you're
my fiercest competition."
Because it really--
the answer either way
wouldn't have mattered
and would have been easier
to stomach.
- Was it a positive experience
for you
or a negative experience?
- There were negative aspects,
but as a whole, it was positive.
I mean, I've been given so much
that was never promised to me.
Nothing was promised to me
from this,
and I've been able to travel.
I mean, I'm 35 years old.
I've never been to New York.
I got to go to New York
and walk red carpets,
and I just have been
afforded so much.
I'm so lucky.
- Stacy Layne, do you think
you're forever changed
from having done this show?
- Oh, Lord, yes, honey.
I've even had marriage proposals
from Africa.
- Oh.
- So I might have to take
myself up on the offer.
- Kamaru.
[laughter]
- Shangela, you're back again.
I can't seem to get rid of ya.
- I'm back, Ru.
I'm back.
- Now, how'd it feel
to be given a second chance?
- You know, I feel like I had
a lot of pressure,
I had a lot to prove,
but I really feel
like I belonged
in this competition,
and I was thrilled to be back.
- Do you feel like
you redeemed yourself?
- Well, hallelu, I hope I did.
- [laughing]
Now, you seem to be one
of the most strategic queens
that have ever been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Well, thank you.
- Do you think it helped you
or hurt you in the end?
- I mean, top five.
I definitely feel
like it helped me.
-<i> Entertainment Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reports</i>
that you were just cast
in the new TV show
with Don Johnson.
Tell me about that.
- I recently was cast in a pilot
called<i> A Mann's World.</i>
It's being directed, created,
and written
by Michael Patrick King.
I play a male hairstylist
on the show,
so I'm really excited
about that.
But I'm also excited
about continuing Shangela.
So I'm dual pathing it,
kind of like Beyoncé
and Sasha Fierce.
- Oh, okay.
- Indeed.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, did your stepdaughter
watch the show?
- She did.
- What'd she think?
- Well, I mean, she is--
she's six years old,
so she doesn't
really get the whole,
like, competition.
She wants me to put her in drag.
She wants me to--
you know, she's like,
"I want the same eye shadow
as Carmen,"
and "I want the same lipstick
as Carmen."
She'd ask my husband, like,
"Why is Chris wearing makeup?"
And once you, you know,
answer the question,
it's like she's cool with it.
You know,
she's really smart, so...
- Yeah.
Now, were you surprised
when the judges
brought you back?
- I was.
I was really surprised
and grateful,
more than anything.
- Now, in the music challenge,
Shangela manipulated it
so that you would get reggae.
What do you think about that?
- I don't think so.
Honestly,
when it came down to it,
I was not gonna go
with country, period.
- But, Shangela,
you did have a strategy.
- With us being
the last two left,
I didn't want reggae,
so my strategy
was to make her feel
like I wanted reggae.
I set that up.
Can I have that deal
on the reggae?
I love reggae music,
like, buh, buh, buh.
Ba-da, buh, buh.
- I really like reggae.
So I'm gonna go with reggae.
- Okay.
- If there was a competitive
spirit within her,
where she didn't want me
to have what I wanted--
- Regardless of whatever
Shangela was saying,
I wasn't gonna think
in my mind, "Okay,
"well, she wants reggae,
so I'm gonna pick reggae
so I can mess her up,"
you know what I mean?
That's not the way I think.
You know, competition or not,
I don't purposely try
to sabotage anyone.
If it came down--
let's say if it was me
and, you know,
if I was in the top three,
that's a different story,
you know what I'm saying?
'Cause it's already--
you--fine.
- But how do you get to the top
three without competing?
- No, but you don't have
to throw people under the bus.
You don't have to, you know,
think like that.
You can just be the best.
You can just be the best,
and then you can win.
- Could you just push them
in front of the subway train?
- [laughs]
- No.
- Now, Shangela,
it seems like you have
a different point of view
in terms of strategizing.
Care to elaborate on that?
- Well, I think everyone
has their own--
their own objective
in this competition.
I was here, fighting to win,
because it meant a lot more
than just the check.
It meant security;
it meant being able
to provide for my family
and to pursue my dreams,
'cause that's why
I'm really here.
- Yara Sofia,<i> echa pa'lante.</i>
- Yes.
- Are you feeling
the<i> echa pa'lante</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
down in Puerto Rico?
- Of course, darling.
- You're still serving it up?
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, darling.
- Very sad
to see your elimination.
- I know.
- You gave up during
the middle of the number.
- I'm crying because there's
a lot of emotions.
I was thinking too much.
I'm so angry,
and I'm so disappointed.
During the competition,
I was, like,
holding in a lot of emotions.
Challenge after challenge
every week,
it's so challenging,
you know what I mean?
I kind of disagrees
with some of the judgment.
The judges, like, sometimes
putting other one on top of me,
like, over.
Like, "Oh, my God,
I love you,
"the way you fart,
the way you fall,
the way you walk,
the way you wear everything."
And then I was like,
"Oh, okay."
I don't think I agreed,
you know what I mean?
- Right.
Who were they praising over you
that made you feel that way?
- Well, it depends.
- Names, darling, I want names.
- Raja.
She's a great makeup artist.
And she could do a better job.
If you choose this kind of drag,
be the best.
- Do you feel that you could
have gone a little bit further?
- Where's further?
- Could you have pushed more,
<i>echa pa'lante?</i>
- Yeah, probably.
But, um, after you--
um, the judges
asked us the question, like,
"Why you deserve to be
the next drag superstar
and win 75 fucking dollars?"
- [laughs]
- Thousand.
- Yeah. [laughs]
It was a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.
- And uh, it--
probably in another moment--
- That's a perfect point,
because it does come down
to how you react in that moment.
- Yes.
- And a lot of this competition
emulates what real life is
in show business,
and sometimes,
it comes down to that moment
where I cannot go on
any further,
but somewhere,
that energy's gotta come.
- It's out of--
it's out of my hands.
- Yeah, I understand.
I understand.
All right.
Let's see what
the top three queens have to say
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
Are you ready
for the final three?
First, let's welcome
a true pageant princess,
honey.
- Alexis Mateo!
- Sickening.
The jig is up.
Bam!
- Next,
a multi-talented queen
who's a real thriller.
- Manila Luzon!
Imelda Marcos!
Big Bird!
Give it.
[drumroll]
- And now, the one queen
who, week after week,
had us gagging
on her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,
America's next drag superstar,
- The one, the only Raja.
- Pose!
Lift!
Tan, tan, tan.
- Alexis Mateo, honey.
- Hi, Ru.
Bam!
- Bam!
Is your family proud,
how well you did?
- My family has been
very supportive.
My mom became
one of my biggest fans.
It actually helped me
to understand
my family point of view
about the situation,
because I grew up in a very
Catholic, Pentecostal family.
- Ooh, child.
- And now--yes.
We have been mediating
between what was
the homosexuality
and, like, the whole drag
experience in my family.
But now they see me as an actor,
more than just a wannabe woman.
That it was the point
that I really wanted
to put across in my family.
- Yeah.
Now, this was your third
audition for the show.
- Yes.
- Uh, what do you--
how do you think
it would have turned out
had you been chosen
the first go-round?
- Oh, child, if I was chosen
the first season
or the second one,
I probably went home
the first two episodes.
- Really?
- Think about it that way.
- Exactly,
and I would have come back,
in the third one in a box.
[laughter]
- What would you say to queens
who have auditioned
in previous seasons,
like yourself,
and didn't get chosen.
- Keep trying.
When the fire is there
and when you wake up
in the morning,
that's what you want to do,
go for it.
Never, never give up.
- Now in the Life, Liberty,
and Pursuit of Style challenge,
you revealed you had
a relationship
with an active duty marine.
- Papi, I want you
to come back home, baby.
- Have you heard from him
since the show's aired?
- [laughs]
Not at all, Ru.
And I wish him the best.
I already closed that chapter
in my life.
- What would you say
if I told you
we have him backstage
right now?
[laughter]
In drag.
- In drag?
[laughs]
- Can you bring him out now?
- Yes, immediately,
please!
- We are not that kind of show.
We can't afford the airfare.
But we could afford
a DNA result,
and the result is...
[laughter]
Manila Luzon.
- Hi, Ru.
Hey, girls.
- Hey, girlfriend.
- [laughs]
- Now, let's get
into the real story here
that's been
on everybody's mind.
Your characterizations
of Asian-Americans
or just Asians in general
came under a lot of heat.
Have you heard
from groups or people
who say you were wrong
or you were right?
- When the episode
of the news challenge aired...
Klistin, "terr" us,
what's next?
I got a lot
of, um, negative feedback
saying people thought
it was offensive,
but they were always,
like, not Asian.
Comment after comment
left on my Facebook page.
"Um, I'm Asian.
"I didn't find that offensive.
I thought it was hilarious."
It's also the whole thing
of humor.
If it's not kind of--
if it doesn't push any buttons,
it's not funny.
- Now, there were a lot
of emotions
for you on this show.
Uh, your father,
did he get to see the show?
- After I got back home,
I called him up,
I sent him a letter,
and he wrote me back,
and he said,
"Okay, I understand that's--
"this is what you're doing,
but it's still
a little strange for me."
So it was just like
an open discussion
that I'm just trying
to keep, like--
let him, like,
marinate in a while.
- Did your mother
watch the show?
- My mom watches the show,
and she's always
calling me back, like,
"Oh, my God,
Carmen's so pretty."
I'm like,
"Mom, what about me?"
[laughter]
- And, Miss Raja,
how's it feel to be
America's next drag superstar?
- Surreal.
Surreal, abstract.
Sometimes invasive a little bit,
'cause there's a lot of haters
out there,
which is kind of
a new thing for me.
- Now, your win is
actually very controversial,
and, you know,
uh, some people have--
saw you as the fiercest thing
ever to walk a runway,
and other critics have said
you're just a man in a dress.
- You mean her?
I'm just kidding.
- Well, actually,
that was Alexis Mateo's quote.
[laughter]
- If it were said to me
ten years ago
and I was at a different place
in my head and in my life,
I would have been
completely offended,
and I would have told everyone
to fuck off,
but, you know,
now I'm in my early 30s.
- Uhh!
[laughter]
- My mid--mid-30s,
and you know what?
I've just come to a place
in my life
that I don't really mind
embracing the fact
that there's a masculine
and a feminine.
And why not join
the two together
and morph it into
one amazing creature, right?
- Well, it worked
for Bea Arthur.
- Absolutely.
[laughter]
- Now, you kids all have
Twitter and Facebook and all.
Do you read the comments
from the people out there?
- Um, I do,
and I don't.
On Twitter, you're only allowed
a certain amount of characters
to cuss someone out.
And on Facebook, it takes
a little bit more effort
'cause you have
to like the bitch first
and then leave her
a mean comment.
- Well, a lot of people
have said that Raja
was too, uh, experienced
for the competition.
Do you feel that way?
- As far as me being seasoned,
yes, I am seasoned.
And, yes, I have been doing it
a long time.
And, yes,
people do know who I am.
But there was nothing said that
America's next drag superstar
should be a beginner who's never
been known or seen, you know?
- Or maybe she could have been.
- She could have been,
you know?
There's still a long line
and legacy
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
still yet to happen,
I hope, you know?
And I think
there's a lot of room
for different styles,
different points of view
in drag and what--
how we perceive
our own personal art.
I think there's still
tons of room for that.
Now I want to talk
about something
that was touched on earlier.
Delta said that
we were like a sorority
and a fraternity mixed together.
And there's a lot of comments
that sometimes backstage,
we are harsh with one another.
But the truth is,
if we were in a locker room,
some of the things
that wives would hear from men--
and we are men--
could be harsh too.
We call it, what's the T?
And the T being the truth.
I want to open the floor
about that.
Now, Raja, you came under
a lot of criticism
because you could be seen
as harsh
with your backstage speak.
- It was like watching
a sports event.
You know, no one wants
to go to the soccer game
and, like, hope that
the two teams love each other.
"Oh, my God.
"I hope he gives the ball
to that guy.
Oh, my God.
I hope that he makes the goal."
Nobody does that.
There's a battle that happens.
Reading is fundamental,
and I think
it's definitely part
of drag culture,
and it's fun.
It's our way of like,
you know,
straight guys
come up to each other,
and they punch each other
on their shoulder.
That's what we're doing.
- To me, I think it's a way
of sharpening your wit
and getting quicker
and thinking quicker,
and you have to be on your game.
And it's like practicing
before a baseball game.
You have to throw
that ball hard,
and you have to do it quick,
and you have to catch it hard
and throw it right back.
- Shangela, do you agree?
- Some of the things that I saw
throughout the season,
just, they didn't sit well
with me,
and I hate to keep even
giving it attention,
but this whole
Heathers/Boogers thing,
that's ridiculous.
But if you want
to put someone down
to build yourself up,
then, you know,
that's what you have
to do for yourself.
I mean, if this is
the face of Booger,
I think it's sickening,
so ta-da.
Hell, minus the lawsuits
and the prostitutes
and the drugs
and the tiger blood,
I'm the Charlie Sheen of drag.
Duh, winning.
- Alexis,
did you feel put down
by being called a Booger?
- No, I think
it was stupid as hell.
It was hilarious to listen
to a person
believing on that
to make herself feel better.
- Honestly, 'cause I heard it,
like, three times today,
you guys were saying, "Oh, well,
we're calling you Boogers
so that we can feel better
about ourselves."
I don't think that's
what it was at all.
- Well, why did you call us
a Booger?
- Because it's not shady.
It's funny.
It's just for fun.
- To you.
- But if you take it
that personal,
that's your insecurity.
- No, baby,
it's not insecurity.
It's clockin' it how it is.
Let's get it real.
If you want to bring it,
let's do it.
- Who else didn't think
that Heathers versus Boogers
was funny or tongue-in-cheek?
- When I first started drag,
I was a Booger down.
You know,
I was a Booger for years.
- Explain what that is.
- Well, a Booger
is just a term that, in drag,
of just being, like, a busted,
like, unpolished mess.
- When you call us Boogers,
you're calling us not polished.
- A mess.
- A mess, a beginner.
- I think what--
what's happening here
is that people are taking
everything so damn literal.
It wasn't a reference point of,
you look physically
like a booger.
It was a state of mind.
And that fact was
that we're grown men.
We know our names
aren't Heather,
even though they're
right here on our necks.
We know that
that's not the case.
And we kept doing it
over and over
because it was
the audacity of that.
The audacity that
this farting Mexican man up here
in a blond wig
is really Heather.
- Why did you call
this particular group of girls
Boogers?
- Because it's extreme,
it's funny,
it's exaggerated,
as much of what drag is.
And it's not that we were being,
you know, literal,
and we're not really
putting you down.
It was just like,
at some point,
the whole idea of Heathers
and Boogers
just kind of dissipated for me
and Heathers just meant
my three little friends
that I felt safe around.
- Who would you consider
the queen of the Boogers?
- Personally, I had my most,
biggest frustrations
with Shangela,
so in my mind,
I think it would be Shangela
'cause that was my, like...
- Nemesis.
- My nemesis at the time.
- Now, Stacy, when I asked
who was offended
by the word "booger,"
you raised your hand.
What's going on?
- Just listening
to the comments,
I just felt like it was
a little bit different
than what I saw in person,
because I felt this nice,
kind people in front of me,
and then to watch it,
the behind the scenes,
and to see what people
"really" thought about me,
it was very difficult for me,
and it took a toll on me.
- What specifically?
I want to know
what specifically?
Who offended you the most?
- Raja, basically, you know,
just saying
that I shouldn't be here anyway,
I shouldn't be here at all.
The whole bullfrogs thing,
it bothered me so much.
- Looking at the episodes,
I'm like,
"Some of the things that I said
were quite harsh," you know?
And I was just kind of
blurting them out
and just being a badass
about it,
but I don't think
I really meant it
to hurt anyone's feelings.
The Heathers
and the Boogers thing
was all meant to be fun
and light,
and it still should be
sort of that,
but it really shouldn't be taken
literal,
and if I could actually
just sort of just squash it
and not really perpetuate it
any further--
I mean, I feel like Stacy
was probably
the most vulnerable
out of the group.
And apparently the things
that were said
have really hurt her,
and if I could just sort of
reach out to you,
and I don't know if it means
anything to you at all,
but I would like to present you
with my Heathers necklace,
which really means a lot to me.
Wait, just hold on.
I want you to have this, so...
- Yay, I'm a Heather.
[laughter]
- I love you.
- Aw!
- Yay.
- That's very nice.
[applause]
That's very nice.
I tell you what,
from this moment on,
there will be no more Heathers;
there will be no more Boogers.
We will all be referred to
as Hoogers.
[laughter]
- Hoogers!
- Queens, get your questions
ready for Michelle Visage,
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
continues.
Now, this season,
my best squirrel friend,
Michelle Visage,
joined the judges' panel,
and the main stage
will never be the same.
Hey, Michelle.
- Hey, baby.
- [laughs]
Now, this season,
you had a chance
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens,
and you chose
Miss Carmen Carrera.
- I did.
- Now, let me ask
what's on America's mind.
Why?
- Look at her.
No, really--
- Is it because
you're from New Jersey?
- Yes,
that's exactly why, Ru.
- [laughing]
- Repping the Garden State.
No.
Billy Santino and I
felt that--
Delta came up,
Mariah came up.
We were all back and forth,
trying to figure out
who to bring back,
and in the end,
we all agreed unanimously
that Carmen
was fresh on the mind,
fresh on the lips,
and we knew
that she had more tricks
up her sleeve,
or so we thought.
- Now, Alexis, you almost
left the competition
because of comments
that you felt Michelle made
about you.
- Yeah.
I think you're a bitch,
Michelle.
[laughter]
- It's frustrating
'cause we're dealing
with so much pressure,
and, like, I mean, you think
you're killing
the hip-hop moment.
You a little came down,
and she got--
she bring you back in
120 degrees.
She's like,
"You're not giving me hip-hop.
"You're Hannah Montana,
a hooker version
of Hannah Montana."
- This is like Hannah Montana
does hip-hop.
- Hannah Montana?
- Yeah.
- And I was like,
"Really, bitch?"
-<i> Pero una pregunta.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Okay?
Would you rather me
sit there and go,
"Oh, honey,
you're fabulous."
- Like, I'm gonna say it,
and I'm gonna say it one time.
- Okay.
- It's so easy to talk
about a drag queen,
but it's so difficult
to be one.
- Honey, I know.
- It's amazing.
It's amazing.
I mean, for me,
drag is a female illusion,
and to make comments
about a plate
that I just bought
that actually helped me
reach the point
of female illusion is stupid,
because you bought
your titties too.
- Yes, I did, absolutely.
- So it's completely--
it's completely pointless,
because that's what we are.
And then to see that I'm getting
picked in the little details,
where Raja doesn't even
wear titties, is--
- She is tonight.
She's got something going on.
- Yeah, it's complicated.
- Okay, now let me explain
where I was coming from
so you understand.
I think you are
an amazingly talented queen.
I think you're gorgeous.
With all of you,
my job was to help you
get to the next level.
Tonight, your body
looks perfect to me.
Like, I would have no critique
of this, Alexis.
I know I have my issues,
and I try to dress accordingly,
so I kind of hide those flaws.
Why would you do something
that makes you
30 pounds heavier looking
when you don't need to?
That was my only issue.
I'm just here to be as real
as I can be,
minus my boobs.
And you want to rock
a breastplate, that's fine.
I grew up in New York City,
where drag queens don't do that.
So I do get your pageant drag.
I get it.
It's not that I don't get
anybody's drags.
I know regional drags
are different.
But I just wanted to see things
switched up every now and then.
Tonight, you don't have it,
and you look beautiful.
- But I do--wearing--
I'm wearing titties.
- That's fine.
That's different.
- I love my titties,
and I work it out all the time.
- And you should.
- Bam, yes.
- Bam.
- I'm wearing a body pad, so...
[laughter]
- Now, this is an opportunity
for all the girls.
If you have something to say
to Michelle Visage,
now is your time.
- I thought you were mean.
I mean, that eyebrow
just kind of goes up,
and those cheekbones
are all up here.
When God painted
the Michelle doll,
he painted her fiercely,
so I just think you have
that look on your face.
- I was always the girl
at the club
where somebody would come up
and say,
"Why you look like that?
Why don't you smile?"
And I'd be like,
"Why don't you get away?"
- Actually, I just wanted
to commend her.
I did enjoy
the consistent judging,
and it seemed like
she wasn't temperamental,
and then I really did get
a good vibe.
There's a term called
"Stone Cold Carter"
in the ballroom scene,
and it's for those,
the mugs that don't smile.
- Uh-huh.
The judges who--
who don't give any--
- Well, her.
- Uh-huh.
- It's not every judge
had a mug.
- Well, Michelle Visage
is from the ballroom scene.
- Yes, she is,
and I definitely related to her.
- All right, now,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
are the best fans
in the whole wide worldwide net.
- [laughs]
[snaps]
- So here's some questions
that you've shemail, tweeted,
or posted on our
Face-face-facebook fan page.
The first question is
from David in New Hampshire,
and it is for Mimi Imfurst.
Why do you always look
so scared?
[laughter]
[person speaks indistinctly]
- I don't know.
Do I look--
do I look so scared
all the time?
- She's painted that way.
- I'm surprised.
I think it--
probably it relates back
to during the competition.
I think I definitely had
a lot of insecurities.
- Did the competition scare you?
- I scared--
I think I scared myself
more than anything.
I--I got lost in my own world
of not trusting
that I have good ideas,
and I let it be my demise.
- All right, this next question
is for India Farrah
from Anonymous
in northwest Indiana.
Says, "I'm a 13-year-old
aspiring drag queen.
What is your biggest piece
of advice you could give?"
- Oh, wow.
- You started at 12.
- Yes, I started
at the age of 12.
- So basically you were
the Miley Cyrus of drag.
[laughter]
- Absolutely.
Luckily my brother
is gay as well,
so it was kind of easier,
and with my family
being so supportive,
that was really easy
for me to do it.
So try to feel comfortable
in your own skin.
Don't pay attention to, like,
the negative, like, comments,
the bullshit.
Let it go in one ear
and out the other.
- All right, next we have
a question for Shangela.
It's from Kayla G.
who wants to know,
"While watching the show,
did you ever get sick
of hearing yourself
say hallelu?"
[laughter]
- Actually no, because I like
to say, "I live in the lu,"
because "hallelu" is more
than just a word to me.
It's kind of the way
that I live.
It's joyous.
- It's an attitude.
- It's happy.
It's an attitude.
It's a way of life...
- Yeah, it's a way of life.
- To me, hallelu.
- Okay. Right on, right on.
Joseph G. in Los Angeles
asks,
"Carmen, have you seen J. Lo
since the taping?"
- So I've been around
Jennifer Lopez in person,
I mean, movie sets, concerts,
like...
I went to her birthday party
impersonating her.
Like, Marc asked me to come,
whatever.
No.
Mm-mm.
I usually get to see her
when she's, like, on tour
or when she's doing, like,
a movie.
If she's filming a movie,
it's like...
I can be with her
for, like, a week
because she's
at the same location.
Like, you know what I mean?
But I haven't seen her.
I'll see you soon, Jennifer.
We're gonna do a video together,
and we'll put it out there
and post it on Facebook
to clear all the rumors.
- Gorge.
All right.
Now, the next question
is for Raja,
and it is from Tommy
in Salt Lake.
"Have you heard from Tyra Banks
since your parody of her
on the Snatch Game?"
Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.
What do they call that?
- Smissing.
- [laughs]
Tyra,
is there anything going on
that you want
to tell us about?
- What?
- Are you smissing too hard?
- I think I smissed so hard,
my eyes bled, girl.
- Oh, my goodness!
- Mm-mm.
Nope, haven't heard from her
at all.
But, you know, I do hear
from Miss J all the time.
He's like, "Walk back,
you fucking crazy...
blah, blah, blah,"
just all through texts.
Tyra did tweet me,
but that was when the season
first started.
- Okay.
- When the season--
She hadn't seen me
do her parody yet.
- Ooh.
- Hope she has a sense of humor.
- She does.
I know Tyra well enough,
even though we're not
the bestest friends
by any means,
but I do know her well enough
that she would have
a great sense of humor about it.
And, you know, she's funny.
She's crazy just like us.
She's a big ol' drag queen,
so she gets it...
I hope.
- [laughs]
- Now, Yara, I do have
a question for you.
It's from Michael H.
in Los Angeles.
"What did
your little person friend
think of Yara Sofia?"
- He love it.
You know what?
I haven't received,
like, a bad comment
or a bad feedback
about the little person
performance.
- Good. good.
It's been a year of
unprecedented twists and turns,
and if I could live
this season all over again,
I wouldn't change a thing.
Now, to those of you
out there watching,
don't fuck it up.
Continue to support my girls
live and in person,
on Facebook, Twitter,
and wherever fine sequins
are sold.
Now, here to announce the winner
of Miss Congeniality,
as voted by you,
the superfans,

for two
to the luxury Our Lucaya Resort
on Grand Bahama Island.
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah, baby.
- Courtesy
of AlandChuck.travel,
America's number one
gay vacation specialist.
And lucky for you,
you only have one island
over from where you live.
[laughter]
You could swim there.
Yara, what do you have to say
to your fans?
- I love you all.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Mwah.
Thank you.

- My name is Delta Work.
I'm 34 years old, and I'm
from Norwalk, California.
There's gonna be a good half
the people watching
that think that a big girl
can't win this competition.
But if you can't get past that,
then you're not gonna get into
everything I have to offer.
I'm here not just to represent
the big girls.
I wanna follow in RuPaul's
footsteps.
- My name is Christopher Ulman,
also known as Carmen Carrera.
I am 25 years old
from New Jersey.
Titties, titties!
- [laughing]
- Body!
- Carmen Carrera is, like, the
flyest girl
you're gonna ever meet
in your life.
I make sure that her body is
flawless.
If you find a flaw, let me know.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, look at your shoes.
I love them!
- Oh, those are rad.
- Fierce, honey, fierce.
My name is Phoenix.
I'm 29 years old.
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.
Yay, craziness.
When I walk in, I want people to
be like, okay...
she could be a handful.
I can play well with others.
My mom raised me well.
But I definitely do have a
bitchy side.
- [falsetto] Hello!
- Well, hel-lo!
- Manila!
- Hi! Oh, my God, look at you!
I'm Manila Luzon.
I am a creative little kid from
the Midwest whose creativity was
too big for Minnesota.
So I moved to New York City.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here.
I love Manila.
I know her from working
in New York.
- This is the most clothes I
have seen you ever in.
- I know.
- Always buck naked.
My drag persona Manila is my
personal muse because...
I inspire myself.
[laughs]
- Hi!
- Hi.
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.
I'm 25 years old, and I'm from
Back Swamp, North Carolina.
I'm very much so
a country queen.
I live on a dirt road surrounded
by corn fields.
Can't get more country than
that.
- We got two of y'all tonight.
- Okay.
- Yes, honey.
- Being a plus-size queen living
in a drag community
that's so vicious--
it's so vicious--
it's built me up to be who I am.
- The weather girls are here.
- Say, word.
[door opens]
- Hello!
all: Hi!
- My name is Adam,

I'm 26 years old, and I live

Hi, baby.
Venus's female role models are
Madonna, of course,
Grace Jones, Barbra Streisand,
and Jean Harlow.
She's just a blond bombshell
ditzy bimbo.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm 26.
I'm from Puerto Rico.
I'm the Puerto Rican one, so...
- So? I'm the Asian.

- From L.A., I'm Italian.
- I'm from L.A., also.
I'm black.

- Everybody knows who is
Yara Sofia in Puerto Rico.

of the party.
I mean, you cannot miss her.
A 6'2" glamazon walking through
the middle of the room with legs
like a racehorse.
- Y'all got things worked
in yet?
- No, we're just kinda waiting
around for all the girls to come
so we can judge them.
- Oh. There's more?
I've dominated and conquered
drag's face
for the past 11 years.
There's really nobody who can
touch Mariah.
- Hey, hey, hey!
all: Hi!
- How's everybody doing?
My name is Alexis Mateo.
I'm 30 years old.
Everybody's having fun?
all: Yes.
- [giggles]
- Are you from Texas?
- I'm living in Florida right
now--I'm from Puerto Rico.
- Oh, see, double down!
We got two big girls,
we got two Puerto Ricans.
- What I hate the most is that
people label you
as the Latin queen.
I'm not just a Latin queen.
When I'm in drag, I'm a star.
- Oh!
- Ooh.
Oh, my.
It's embarrassing to walk in
with a room with a whole bunch
of queens,
and you guys are wearing
the same outfit.
- I was like, oh, my gosh.
I know they are gasping
for breath right now.
- I'm India Ferrah.
I'm from Dayton, Ohio.
I'm 23 years old.
Girl, prison, honey.
I look over to Phoenix copying
my style.
So I actually had to go up to
her and,
you know, be a little cunt
to her.
I love your hair.
[laughter]
- I'm definitely wearing the
hair better, the vinyl better.
India's very, like...painted.
She's very, like,
old-school drag.
But it's cool.
It's cool to see, like,
that style of drag still
amongst us, so...
- Have we figured out who's
gonna be the bitch yet?
- Ooh!
[murmuring]
- Welcome to my party!
all: Hi!
- Oh, my gosh!
I brought cookies.
I'm Mimi Imfurst.
I'm 27,
and I'm from New York City.
How y'all doing?
I just want to start off on good
terms with all these bitches
before I start taking them down.
[laughing]
So who's the bitch here?
It's what I need to know
right away.
- You know what...I think we're
gonna appoint you.
You okay with that?
- Girl, no.
- She ain't that slick, honey,
Miss Mimi.
Before there was Mimi,
there was Mariah.
- Oh...
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.
- It's the purple people eater!
- [laughing]
Hi, ladies.
My name's Sutan,
also known as Raja.
I'm 36 years old, and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
Raja's a model.
She's uber-stylish.
She was doing stuff that Gaga's
doing now
before Gaga even knew about it.
Yay!
- When Raja walked in,
100% pure family walked in.
- Umph, umph, umph!
I love you!
How are you?
What's your name?
- I see you lookin' at me.
[laughter]
Her look is definitely not
polished.
It's definitely not fabulous.
It almost looks as if I went
into my granny's trunk
in the attic.
- I could see the surprised look
on everyone's faces.
It was the exact the reaction
I wanted.
We're drag queens.
We're meant to be pioneers.
So why not wear a funny little
cyclops hat?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Raja.
It's a pleasure to meet you
guys.
- Club kid.
Where's her body, where's her
hair, where's her makeup?
I don't see her on the same
level as the rest of us.
[alarm whoops]
-<i> Whoo, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
<i>Welcome, racers.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>You know great things</i>
<i>come in threes--</i>
<i>The Supremes, Destiny's Child,</i>
<i>Mark Wahlberg's nipples.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Now, RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
<i>season three, hunty, okay?</i>
- Yeah!
-<i> So you think you know what it</i>
<i>takes to become America's Next</i>
<i>Drag Superstar?</i>
<i>Well, think again!</i>
<i>Watch your back, my queens.</i>
<i>'Tis the season when anything</i>
<i>and everything can change in</i>
<i>the blink of an eye.</i>
<i>So strap in, and let's get this</i>
<i>mothertruckin' drag race</i>
<i>on the road, okay?</i>
[all whooping]
- Hello, hello, hello!
[laughing]
Wow!
Look how purdy you are!
How gorgeous!
I think I'm gonna cry!
[laughter]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I am so thrilled to be standing
here among such royalty.
You, my dears, are the fiercest
of the fierce!
- Yes!
- This is your chance to show
the world that you've got the
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent to be America's Next
Drag Superstar.
<i>The</i><span style="bodyStyle"> winner</i>
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup,
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails perfected
by Absolut.
And America's Next Drag
Superstar will also receive...
$75,000.
- [whooping]
- $75,000!
[cheers and applause]
- Bitch...
- That's a lotta fucking money.
- You know, they say Christmas
comes but once a year.
But around here, we like to deck
the halls all year round.
I declare that it's officially
Christmastime
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race!</i>
[cheers and applause]
- To kick off the holiday,
I have a little gift from me
to you.
Oh, pit crew!
-<i> Ooh!</i>
-<i> Ow!</i>
[laughter]
- Well, kiss that Christmas!
Baby, I was starting to get
a little sweaty.
These guys are fine.
Maybe there's something bigger
and buffer
coming out of the box.
I was ready for the third one.
It was about to be a party.
- Now, if good things come in
small packages,
then this is gonna be
re-donkulous!
- Hallelu, ladies!
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!
- And there's Shangela.
Hallelu.
- Hallelu, hallelu!
Oh!
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays, bitches.
[chortling]
- Everybody's face...gagged.
What the fuck?
Who invite this girl again?
She already got her moment
of glory.
She got eliminated.
- Sahara Davenport...
Shantay. You stay.
Shangela, you have only
just begun.
But I have a feeling...
we haven't seen
the last of you yet.
Now, for the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
I'm giving one of my girls
a second chance.
Shangela will be joining you
in this competition.
all: Oh...
-<i> Welcome, Shangela.</i>
- It's a nice thing that
Shangela's here,
but she doesn't threaten me
in any way.
- So now that all 13 of my girls
are here...
are you ready for your close-up?
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, down, mami.
- What's going on?
- This is celebrity photographer
Mike Ruiz.
Mike has set up this gorgeous
Christmas winter wonderland
scenario,
and he's gonna get a few shots
of you.
- Okay.
- Today is the first challenge
of the entire race,
and it's so important
because it's the first
impression that they make.
- This is gonna be a sexy, sexy
cover of your Christmas card.
You are going to be jumping on
that trampoline to do it.
- Oh, God.
[laughing]
I'm not gonna be able to pull
this off.
I'm wearing the wrong dress
to be jumping.
This is gonna be terrible.
Wait, let me just make sure that
all my jewels are locked away.
- Well, you've got several
jewels.
- Okay, all right,
let's do this, yo!
[laughs]
- It's snowin' at the Jersey
Shore!
Blow this, Snooki.
Yes, mama.
You...
- Oh--
[laughter]
- The flying lady
on a Rolls-Royce!
- Don't worry.
We're good, we're good.
I'm sorry.
That photo shoot
was such a mess.
I was not ready for none
of that.
-<i> Okay, we got one.</i>
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>
<i>Gorgeous!</i>
- Uh-oh.
- Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm okay.
- Careful, Mimi.
I can see your nutcracker, hon.
- Whoo!
- [laughs]
Yeah...yeah.
Let's start again.
And hit it.
[camera shutter clicks]
Crazy. Okay.
Mimi had a really hard time
maintaining composure.
She wasn't giving us sexy.
She was giving us crazy.
- Pick your feet up.
Whoo--ooh hoo hoo!
- I'm jumping on the trampoline
with my boobs,
which are very heavy.
They weigh about 12 pounds.
I was sweating to death.
They wanted to fall off.
- I think your breasts are
throwing your balance off.
- They're throwing
my balance off.
- [grunting]
- There ya go.
- [laughs]
I was a little nervous
about this challenge.
Me being a plus-size queen
trying to jump around on a
trampoline is not cute.
-<i> You gotta jump</i>
<i>as high as you can.</i>
<i>A little bit higher, if you</i>
<i>can.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>
- And he keeps telling me to
jump higher, jump higher.
But my fat ass, I'm sorry...
[laughs] I can't jump that high
on a trampoline.
-<i> One, two, three!</i>
Beautiful.
Okay, do something nasty now
with that candy cane.
Ride that cane!
Beautiful.
Mariah just, like,
radiates sexuality.
- Your eggnog brings
all the boys to the yard.
Send in the clowns!
[laughter]
Hi, Raja.
- Hi, Raja!
- Come on down.
- W.T.F.?
To see a trampoline flanked
by half-nude men...
I mean, what else could
I ask for?
-<i> Gimme sexy face.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Oh, yes!</i>
-<i> Okay. You know what I want,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>
- Oh, yes, mami!
- Raja is this beautiful,
elegant gazelle.
He really has a good sense
of his body
and how to portray it
in a photograph.
One, two, three.
- Hi.
Ooh!
Look at you guys!
What's up, dudes?
What's up, bros?
Everyone's unpacking, and I got
a chance to kind of look around
the room and see everyone
stripped down
without their makeup,
the wigs are gone,
the paddings are gone.
And I got to see these men and,
you know what?
I've gotta say some of them
are kind of cute.
Yara's kind of a cute boy.
Tattoos.
Oh, my God, kind of hottie
over there.
Oh, my god, that one--is that
even out of drag yet?
Stacy looks like a girl out
of drag.
I was like,
is that somebody's mama?
-<i> For Puerto Rico!</i>
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
- Alexis, a little Ann-Margret
she was giving me today.
And sexy face.
- Sexy face!
-<i> Gorgeous. We got it.</i>
<i>That was it.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>Ooh, how phallic.</i>
Manila was actually really great
on the trampoline,
very limber and very capable.
- [gags]
[laughter]
-<i> Okay, we got it!</i>
- [gags]
- Good. And sexy!
- Oh...oh!
- Try and get off the ground
just a little bit more.
One, two, three.
Okay, and hit it.
Not so high with your hands.
Keep your hands down here.
One, two, three.
-<i> Ooh, Merry Christmas!</i>
-<i> Higher, higher!</i>
-<i> You look like a snow leopard.</i>
- Hi!
- Hey, Shangela.
- Hi, Ru!
- Good to see ya.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- One year later, and I'm in
front of Mike Ruiz again.
I have something to prove.
Get out here and turn it out.
Round two, baby.
I am ready.
- All right.
- I look forward to it.
<i>Okay, yea--</i>
<i>oh, yes, mama!</i>
Sex-ual!
<i>Christmas never looked so sexy!</i>
-<i> You have made us proud.</i>
<i>You have done your homework.</i>
- Yay! Thank you.
Whoo!
Girl, got me right on together.
When I step into that room, I
felt like I'd gone back in time.
Well, I remember the spot that
was unlucky in love for me
last season,
so let me go find a new spot.
Hallelu!
Ooh, praise him.
Ah.
Now, some of these new queens
may not be so excited that
Shangela is back
in the building.
- No, I auditioned, just like--
yeah, I auditioned
just like everyone else.
She kept asking me,
"Girl, how'd you get back?"
She seemed a little cunty
about it.
And I feel like over the last
year I've grown,
and also I wanted to come back
and compete
and really compete.
- Shangela, she says she's
gained enough experience.
All I can say, Shangela,
is prove it.
Serve it, girl.
Because you're under
the microscope now, bitch.
- She's probably one I'm gonna
have to watch my back for.
-<i> Ooh!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Yeah!</i>
[all whooping]
- Over here, baby.
Bring it over here.
Over here, over here.
- Hello, ladies.
Well, who are you?
[all whooping]
- Who are you people?
Now, Mike and I went over all
of your photographs.
One shot in particular really
got our jingle bells ringing.
The winner of the holiday card
photo shoot is...
Raja.
- Yes!
[cheers and applause]
To win the very first challenge
feels good,
feels like I've staked my claim
and put my little mark
on this competition.
I kinda lifted my leg
and pissed on it a little bit.
Cheers, bitches.
[applause]
- Now, tonight I expect you all
to have visions of sugar plums
dancing in your head.
Because the countdown has begun.
Tomorrow, I wanna see you in
your finest daywear drag.
And there's only one shopping
day left until it's Christmas
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[cheers and applause]
[all speaking at once]
[car horns honk]
[wolf whistles]
- Being in drag in the middle
of the day's kind of weird.
It's like the circus
was in town.
[cars honking]
- I felt a little uncomfortable.
I don't do that.
I don't go out in the daytime
in drag.
- When we find out that we have
to go out during the daytime
and go shopping in drag...
I'm good, 'cause, baby,
if it's right, it's right.
[bell dings]
[overlapping chatter]
- There we are,
standing in daytime drag
in the middle of some
thrift store.
Nobody clocked me.
They thought I was Jada Pinkett
Smith up in there.
- Gather 'round, dolls.
Now, Christmas is a season
for miracles and shopping.
And today, you need to do
a little bit of both.
Using only funky old clothes
and used household materials,
you need to ho ho ho it up...
by creating your jolliest
holiday drag look.
You can use your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.
Plus, any holiday chotchkies
you can...
mop.
But the rest of your outfit has
to be 100% thrift store couture,
darlings.
Tomorrow you will debut your
dragtacular holiday look
on the main stage.
Now, you each have $50 and ten
minutes to shop until you drop.
Now, Raja, since you won
the photo shoot,
you get an extra $25 to spend.
- [snaps]
- Gentlemen,
start your engines...
and may the best woman win!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- I had to throw those shoes off
and punch it.
First thing I eyed was that big
lamp in the window.
I knew I'd have to ask, please,
can you give a bitch a bargain?
I just have to have this,
and I don't have $45.
How 'bout $22?
I'm on a budget.
- $23.
- $23! Say hallelu for me.
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu! All right!
You ask, it shall be given.
- Can I see
that gold shiny thing?
- This thing?
- Maybe this could be my skirt.
- You've worn less.
- I'm not sure how much of
an outfit I'm gonna have.
You know, it's gonna have to be
something a little sexy.
- Out of my way, girl.
- It's all ugly.
- Just like some of these
contestants.
- Now, I've shopped in enough
thrift stores in my day to know
that very rarely are you gonna
find my size on a rack.
So I'm just gonna grab
all the fabric I can find.
I need a shopping cart.
-<i> Girl...</i>
- This is the best Christmas
ever.
-<i> Oh! It's so pretty.</i>
- When we walked back
into the workroom,
we have to rush and get any
holiday fixings that we can.
It's a race.
- These ladies are no ladies.
- Don't touch my shit.
This is mine.
-<i> They are runnin' around,</i>
<i>snatching things off the wall.</i>
<i>It is a mad dash.</i>
- Oh, girl,
I found myself a skirt.
Yes!
- Oh...
- Oh, yeah.
I'm ruling this fucking school.
- I just broke my Christian Dior
sunglasses doing this.
I better win this shit.
Ugh!
- I see Shangela.
She is dragging this big-ass
styrofoam snowman
across the room.
Is she gonna wear it?
I don't know
what she's gonna do.
- You always snatching.
What is that?
I'm trying to be sister element
of surprise,
but it's hard when you got
a 5-foot snowman.
She missing a eye and a nose,
but she gonna be all right.
- Ladies, can I just say
something?
I am from Chicago!
[laughter]
- I was waiting
to see the first one
to start screaming at somebody.
I knew it was gonna be
her crazy ass.
Mimi, I think, is one of these
people that, um, really, really
wants to be center
of everything.
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.
- Can I get
a [speaking gibberish]?
- If that's her way,
that's fine, but it's...
annoying as hell to me, so...
- [speaking gibberish]
- I don't know how I came up
with this idea, but...
it is working to my advantage.
I work great under pressure, and
I was just--I was feeling it.
I was feeling great.
[snapping]
-<i> Does anybody have any red</i>
<i>ornaments they don't want?</i>
- No, I need some too.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- Then I noticed Phoenix was
doing the same thing.
That's shady to me.
- Evidently, I'm "copying"
her amazing idea.
- You can be my friend or you
can be my enemy--
just say it to my face.
I mean, if somebody pisses me
off, I'm gonna tell 'em.
- I see the claws are comin' out
early, honey.
Whatever is in the dark
shall come to the light,
especially with regard
to this experience.
- The runway challenge is to
create a Christmas-inspired
outfit from all the things
that we got at the thrift shop.
- Honey, there was nothing
at that store my size.
I'm using bed sheets.
- Oh, right.
- Girl, if I get in this dress
and it does not fit,
I'm gonna cry.
- Ho, ho, ho, ladies.
- Hey.
- Hey, Ru.
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- This is Laquifa.
Shangela Laquifa
in the Wadley family.
- I see.
- I've made a Shange-replica.
That's how I'm gonna turn it out
on that stage.
I designed this piece myself.
This is actually sewn onto
a bodice--I did that.
So hopefully, we'll all be
hitting the runway tomorrow.
- Well, that's all cute,
but we're talking about $75,000
here.
- But it's gonna work.
I feel like, I'm putting a lot
into my creation,
and I'm confident that it'll
at least go over well.
- Now, Shangela,
I have a lot of faith in you.
That's why I invited you back.
- I really appreciate it.
And I'm trying not
to disappoint you.
- All right, terrific.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Phoenix.
- Hey, Ru.
- Merry Christmas.
- You too!
- This is pretty amazing.
Now, these are--are what?
- Shattered...
- Oh, shattered glass.
- Mm-hmm. Shattered glass, yes.
- Oh, you're showing a lot
of creativity--we like that.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Phoenix.
- Thank you, babe.
- Mimi Mimi Mimi Imfurst.
- Ho ho ho, Ru.
- Ho ho ho to you!
Now, I wanna talk about
this amazing...
- [laughs]
- Outfit you have here.
It's very, uh, manger couture.
Would you say you were halfway
done, 3/4 of the way done?
- [laughs] I don't know!
I'm just really nervous,
'cause I don't sew.
Throw me a script, throw me
a song to sing, I can do it.
- Well, you know, those have
been some famous last words
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- I know, I know, I'm just--
I'm--I'm so nervous.
- But you know,
there are other
girls here who don't know
how to sew,
but they're gluin'
and puttin' things together...
we'll see how it plays
on the runway.
- All right.
I am nervous as hell,
because I
have a raggedy-ass dress, but I
have a big problem on my hands.
- Manila Luzon.
- Hi, Ru!
- So now, I wanna hear
about your outfit.
- So I'm gonna have like a fur
collar, and then with the extra,
I'm gonna make a muff.
- Let's talk about this!
[laughing]
You got this picture of...
- That's Sahara Davenport,
my boyfriend.
- How about that?
- Yeah, she was here last
season, so I brought this.
I have my little sketch pad.
Having my boyfriend being
Sahara,
I don't think it's gonna
have any effect on my chances
of winning this contest.
Besides, Sahara didn't win,
and I'm going to.
- All right, so I'm gonna let
you get back to work.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Venus D-Lite.
- Ru-Ru!
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Chrissy kiss!
Kissy kiss!
- Now, look what you have here.
Showgirl always, aren't you?
- Yes. This was a jacket.
I took off the collar, got
ornaments, and I crushed them,
gave it a little glitzy color.
- The crushed thing here--
I saw it on a few others.
Who had it first?
- Me.
- You did.
- And the bitches stole it.
- [laughs] All right, Venus.
- All right, Ru-Ru.
- Carry on.
- Till next time.
Kissy kissies!
- [laughing]
Raja.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hello.
Well, look at this.
It's very Christmas pudding
at Vivienne Westwood's
on Boxing Day.
- You're so right!
That's exactly
what I was going for.
But I really wanted to kinda do
the idea of, like, gift wrap
and how under a Christmas tree,
it's all sort of, like,
hodgepodge and mixed up together
and a little
Christmas tree green skirt
'cause, you know,
that's where you keep all the
presents is under the tree.
Yes, ma'am!
- Well, I can't wait to see this
on the runway.
So keep working on it,
turn it out...
- Okay.
- And I'll see you later on.
Good luck.
- All right, Ru.
Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Carmen.
Wow, look, you've got your
Christmas goin' on here.
- Feeling a little spicy
this Christmas.
- Well, something tells me you
feel spicy every Christmas.
- Yes.
- And Easter...
- Uh-huh.
- And Memorial Day.
This is a lotta body showing.
Oh, she has a little booty-booty
back here.
- Yeah, this is the mistletoe
back there.
- Oh, that's the mistletoe!
I'ma let you get back to it.
I can't wait to see you
pull this off on the stage.
All right, get back to work.
- All right, thank you.
- All right.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Well, hello, Ru.
- Are you having fun?
It seems like
you're the shy one.
- I'm not shy.
I'm just focused.
[both laughing]
- Now, have you been
to California before?
- No, this is my first time,
actually.
- First time in Hollywood.
- First time on a plane.
- First time on a plane.
How about--we are just changing
lives over here!
- I know!
I feel like a different person.
- But can you bring
the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talents?
- I have that,
or I wouldn't be here.
[both laughing]
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Gather 'round, dolls.
All right, ladies.
Tomorrow, on the main stage,
we'll be spending the holidays
with our extra-special guest
judge, the one and only...
Vanessa Williams.
[cheers and applause]
- For some gays and some queens,
they've got Cher and Madonna.
But I'm a big Vanessa Williams
fan.
- 'Tis the season for giving...
so you better be serving up
some holiday realness...
or this could be
your last Christmas.
So don't fuck it up.
I'll see you on the main stage.
Bye.
all: Bye.
- [sobbing]
I fucked it up.
I don't know
what I was thinking!
I don't know how to sew and,
um...
[sniffles] I know it's
my biggest hurdle and...
I'm just a--I've worked so hard
to get here, and I'm just...
I don't wanna fail.
[sniffles]
- Is she okay?
- No.
- Girl, seriously...
come here, babe.
If you have a undergarment,
take it out,
like a full undergarment.
- I don't.
Mariah came over, and she sort
of helped me rethink everything.
- Get your undergarment.
Go get your undergarments.
You need your undergarments.
I knew she had bitten off more
than she could chew so,
you know, when she broke down,
I was like, "Oh, baby."
- What you need to do is pick
out some of your fiercest hair
and, bitch, paint
for filth tomorrow.
I feel bad for her.
I think, you know, she feels
that she's gonna have
to lip-synch for her life
tomorrow night,
and, honestly, I think so too.
- Girl, don't blow your nose
on the fabric, bitch.
- Mimi is freaked out.
Girl! Put yourself together,
darling!
- It's okay, mama.
- No, it's not.
I just have to finish
what I'm working on,
and tomorrow
when I hit the runway,
I wanna sell it like it's
a million-dollar dress.
And if I have to lip-synch,
I'll mother fucking lip-synch
my life off.
[sniffles]
- Hallelu.
- Back to work, ladies.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning, and we only have a
little bit of time to finish up
our Christmas couture.
- The vibe in the workroom felt
very much like
a Santa's workshop,
like, all the elves
were really busy.
- Okay, how come I can't even
sew a fucking jingle bell?
This is just hanging there
like a limp scrotum.
- The emotions are pretty
intense in the room.
Everyone knows that someone's
gotta go home,
and it doesn't matter how
perfect you think you are
or how bad you think
the other person is,
because there's always gonna be
an element of surprise
to these things.
- You feeling a little bit
better today, baby?
- A little bit.
- Okay.
- I had a very long night.
I didn't sleep very well,
but I just need to finish the
garment and sell it
when I go down the runway.
I'm just gonna pray
for a miracle.
- So, Venus, who do you think
is in the bottom?
- I think, um,
Mimi's going home.
Yesterday, Mimi had her
breakdown,
and today, I could just see it
all over her face.
I don't think you can be the
Next Drag Superstar
with no confidence.
- The other queens saw me
at a really vulnerable place,
so they think
that I might be weak.
Whatever.
In this business,
you have to be driven.
I don't think that there's any
drag performers
who are more driven than I am.
I think she might be a dress!
- Mimi had this idea of doing
this Virgin Mary thing.
It just looked like a laundry
bag full of, like, old sheets.
- The last time around I looked
around the room and said,
"Oh, girl, let me get this song
right, 'cause I don't wanna be
in the bottom two."
I don't wanna be lip-synching
for my life again.
It wasn't the best experience
in the world.
But this time around,
I feel really super-confident
about my outfit.
- What was it like to lip-synch
for your life last year, girl?
- Girl.
Girl, have you ever felt like
you were walking the plank
in the pirate ship, okay?
I felt like<i> Pirates</i>
<i>of the Caribbean.</i>
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
- It's funny that the phrase is
"lip-synch for your life,"
because it really feels like
you're gonna die.
No one knows that feeling
until you're there.
Being titled America's Next Drag
Superstar is a big deal.
And I'm not taking it lightly
that I'm back.
- How's your outfit comin',
Raja?
- Pretty good, actually.
I'm getting really happy
with it.
- How old are ya?
- I'm 36.
- Are you seriously?
- I started dabbling in drag
when I was 16.
In my teens, I was a pretty
awkward kid.
You know, walking down the
street, it was like, "faggot."
Drag wasn't bad.
Drag was like, "Fierce, honey!
Fabulous, girl, work,"
you know,
and that's what I needed.
As the years start to pass,
you start to, like,
look at drag differently.
- Do you love it more or...
- I love it in a different way.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
'Cause it's always, like,
changing.
- Yeah.
And I wanna evolve constantly,
you know?
I don't ever wanna be the same
queen for the rest of my life.
- So what do you do, Venus?
- I'm a Madonna impersonator,
mainly.
- Her Madonna is fierce.
She looks just like the bitch.
- I came out at 15, and pretty
much, nobody accepted me.
And all the bullcrap that I went
through growing up,
I think it ended up
making me
a very determined
and driven person.
- Do you do anyone else
besides Madonna?
- I do a lot of characters,
but I had plastic surgery
to look more like Madonna.
[record scratch effect]
- Really? What'd you do?
- I had my cheeks done
and my chin.
- Miss Venus, you're too young,
baby, to have that much work
in your face.
That much wrong work.
- Let me see.
Where is it?
Oh...
- See?
- Is it silicone or--
- It's silicone, yeah.
- I have never had
any plastic surgery.
It's like baseball players
taking steroids.
You're sort of cheating.
- I've had this three times
and this two.
- Well, you better work
that Madonna look, grr.
- All my money and all my time
has gone into drag.
I've dedicated, devoted,
compromised my whole life to be
a drag queen,
and I think that's why I'm here.
Carmen, you always naked.
Naked.
- Sorry. I have to get ready.
- Naked.
- She has been runnin' around
the dressing room all day
completely naked.
Just naked.
I mean, is this
a sex competition,
or is this a holiday couture
competition?
- Miss Carmen,
you gotta be naked.
- Girl, I don't even see it
as naked.
I don't know what these queens
are talkin' about.
I'm sorry, you know, I feel
comfortable with my body.
For me, it's a locker room.
[tape roll stretching]
- I think this hot glue gun
gets way too hot.
It's like a lava gun right here.
- They don't call it
a warm glue gun.
- Oh, fuck.
This hurts.
- Fuck.
- I think everyone
is just really on edge.
We don't have that much time
before we have to be all up in
drag and walkin' out
on that runway.
- How you holding up?
- I wish I had more time.
- You gonna have another
breakdown, girl?
- I hope not.
- Only have a breakdown
if I'm goin' home.
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, tonight is like a RuPaul
family Christmas special,
and it wouldn't be Christmas
without
our very own Santa Claus!
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[laughter]
- The funniest man on earth,
Bruce Vilanch.
Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Ru.
- We are so glad you're here.
- It's tough for a Jewish boy
to do this.
- I know.
I know.
But in this economy,
you'll take it where you can.
- Exactly. I'm up-sizing.
[laughter]
- Santino!
- Hey, Ru.
- Hello, my dear.
- Shall we dance?
- Let's.
- [laughs]
- And the return of Michelle
Visage,
my cohost for over 100 episodes
of the<i> RuPaul</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talk show.</i>
- Couldn't keep us apart.
- [laughs]
And Mike Ruiz.
- Yes!
- We've just gotta stop
meeting like this.
- I know!
- Prissy kissness.
And I saved the best for last.
[laughter]
The lovely and talented
Vanessa Williams is here!
- Darling, you look phenomenal.
- Thank you so much.
I see you glittering
over there too.
- Thank you.
Got some gifts for Santa.
- Yes!
- Thank you!
[laughter]
- This week, our queens were
challenged to make their best
holiday drag looks
using thrift store hand-me-downs
and Christmas decorations.
Gentlemen...start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Carmen Carrera.
- Hey, hey.
- Look at the size of that box!
-<i> My lips are done,</i>
<i>my hair is done.</i>
<i>I'm feeling hot right now.</i>
<i>The spotlight is on me.</i>
<i>You can see my cheeks from</i>
<i>across the street.</i>
- Uh-uh!
- Oh, the mistletoe.
- Is that mistletoe
or cameltoe?
- Look at that body. Ah!
- Manila Luzon.
- Look at the size
of that muff!
- Both hands fit.
-<i> I am living on the runway.</i>
<i>I'm having so much fun.</i>
<i>The snow is coming, and</i>
<i>I'm just struttin' my stuff.</i>
- A desperate housewife
of the North Pole.
- All right!
- He's giving us
Janice Dickinson.
- It's Yara Sofia,
and she's had her nose fixed!
- What a fabulous
set of antlers.
-<i> I was so nervous,</i>
<i>but I feel great.</i>
<i>I did a good job,</i>
<i>and I give them a surprise.</i>
- Hey!
[chuckles]
- Incredible.
- I love it!
- Oh, who do we have here?
That's Phoenix?
Ahoy!
-<i> I think it was definitely</i>
<i>the best Christmas couture</i>
<i>that I could give.</i>
<i>I think my shit's fierce.</i>
<i>I think I could win.</i>
- Oh, holy night,
that skirt is short.
- I can see her figgy pudding!
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Representin' Back Swamp,
North Carolina.
-<i> I think it's time</i>
<i>for a plus-size queen.</i>
<i>The skinny girls try</i>
<i>to take over,</i>
<i>so I think it's time</i>
<i>for us big girls to step up.</i>
- Now, that's
the<i> Jingle Bell Rock.</i>
Oh, it's Venus D-Lite!
Merry Christmas.
-<i> I'm just really trying to be</i>
<i>fun and sassy, little flirty.</i>
<i>I'm being me.</i>
- Oh, lick it.
That looks delicious.
- Somebody's gonna get caned.
- India Ferrah.
- Okay, now.
Look at those two treats.
- Santa, would you like some
milk to go with those cookies?
-<i> I'm looking good, bitch.</i>
<i>My hair is done, makeup right,</i>
<i>and I'm just walking</i>
<i>down the runway,</i>
<i>knowing that I look sickening.</i>
- Ooh, the Fahrenheit
is getting higher!
- Delta Work.
And she is giving us
a Kwanzaa celebration.
-<i> As soon as I hit the runway,</i>
<i>I am just--I'm so excited.</i>
<i>It's exhilarating.</i>
<i>It's what I've been waiting</i>
<i>for.</i>
<i>And I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>giving Kwanzaa realness.</i>
- Erykah Badu!
Leontyne Price.
[laughter]
From Puerto Rico...
Alexis.
- Ooh!
- [trilling]
-<i> Feliz Navidad.</i>
Cha, cha, cha!
-<i> I'm feeling fabulous.</i>
<i>The light, the music,</i>
<i>adrenaline comin' through.</i>
<i>I'm just feeling</i>
<i>on the top of the world.</i>
- Oh!
Oh, yes! Okay.
El Barbizono modeling school-o.
- Love the snowflake earrings.
- Next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Oh, little baby Jesus
in her hands?
- Oh, yes,
it's the Madonna!
- It is!
It's the mother.
- Oh, wait a minute, that's--
that's actually a ham
in her arms.
-<i> I hit the runway,</i>
<i>and I just decide in my mind</i>
<i>that I'm going</i>
<i>to deliver this dress</i>
<i>and deliver the character.</i>
- I wanna see baby Jesus.
- I know--is he asleep
right now?
- He's cooking at 350!
- Hotlanta's own,
Mariah.
- In Christmas gray.
- Oh, she's giving a little
Wilhelmina Slater, I'd say.
- Yes, she is!
-<i> I'm not polished as well</i>
<i>as I know I can be,</i>
<i>but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let the judges see that.</i>
<i>I'm never gonna let them</i>
<i>see me sweat.</i>
- Silver bells!
- Couture Christmas.
- Karl Lagerfeld,
eat your heart out.
Up next is Raja!
Oh, no stranger to the runway.
- Look at the detail
on that skirt.
- Vivienne Westwood!
What?
-<i> Once I get out there,</i>
<i>I feel awesome.</i>
<i>That's my thing.</i>
<i>I am a runway girl.</i>
<i>I am a photography girl.</i>
<i>I'm a model.</i>
- I just can't take my eyes
off of her.
- Gorgeous!
- Yes! Snow angels!
- Was it snow angels or a fit?
[laughter]
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
Oh, she's gained weight!
Oh, there she is.
- She made a snowman.
- She's a little frosty.
Oh, and she's got her piece
of corn there.
- All right!
- It's become a tradition here.
Oh, and her skirts light up!
Where is she keeping
the batteries?
-<i> I am feeling so confident.</i>
<i>I love my outfit,</i>
<i>and all I can think is,</i>
<i>"Shangela, work, bitch."</i>
- You know what I say.
Never work with animals,
children, or snowmen.
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your Christmas drag,
your holiday card photo shoot,
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Will the following queens
please step forward?
Mariah.
Delta Work.
Yara Sofia.
India Ferrah.
Phoenix.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Alexis Mateo.
The seven of you
all stood out...
for not standing out
from the crowd.
You are all safe
from elimination.
But I warn you.
In this competition,
with $75,000 at stake...
"Safe" is a dirty word.
You may leave the stage.
All right, ladies...
you six are the nicest and
the naughtiest of the week.
It is time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Carmen Carrera.
- Well, I think Carmen
used her assets to a T.
- Yes, ma'am!
- All I can think of is bows,
bows, booty.
You used what your maker gave to
you, and you brought the sexy.
- From one Jersey girl to
another, Carmen, you're hot.
You know you're hot.
Here's my one concern:
don't rely on body all the time.
- Y'all, I'd like to hear
from Santa, Bruce Vilanch.
- I'm very concerned
about the mistletoe,
because I think it's bad when
anything takes root there.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Bruce.
Let's take a look
at your holiday photo.
- You didn't really get into,
like, the dancer-ly beauty
of what I was asking
of you guys.
- I've never done
the trampoline before,
and getting on it,
I pulled a muscle.
So I wasn't really ready for
this, and it was kind of like,
the hair wasn't really working
with the--what I had on my arm,
which was getting caught
to the chiffon.
And then my lip gloss was stuck,
you know, and I swallowed
a piece of snow and...
- There's a lot of excuses.
You know, this is a competition.
At the end of the day,
nobody gives a crap.
You just have to bring it.
- Next up, Manila Luzon.
- Being from New York,
you reminded me of a Rockette.
And the second thing was
Marie Osmond, for some reason.
It's very Marie Osmond,
isn't it?
- She has really big hair
these days.
- But very well put together.
- Thank you.
- You are a magical,
fantastical confection.
- Well, this is the second dress
that I've ever sewn in my life.
- Wow. It's great.
It looks like Louis Vuitton.
- Oh!
- I thought more La Toya
Vuitton.
[laughter]
Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
Where'd you get the idea to use
a big prop like that?
- Oh, you talking about
Frostula?
Frostula the Snow Ho.
And if she came to life,
it would be Shangela.
- You kind of have a mild
concept going,
but it's still very kind
of remedial.
The execution is poor.
The back, it's kind
of falling apart.
There just could have been
more attention to detail.
- Now, I did learn to sew.
However, it was a little
difficult in working
with a paper material.
That was new for me.
- Here's the thing--you bring
out a big giant snowman.
The snowman was bigger
than the payoff.
And the thing about props--
you never wanna be upstaged
by a papier-mache snowman,
you know what I'm saying?
You don't!
- Well, I tell you,
on that note,
let's take a look
at your photograph
and see how well you did.
- I see a lot of armpit.
That's the first thing I went
to,
it was like--
armpit, you know.
- But it's fresh.
[laughter]
- All right, Shangela,
thank you very much.
Next up, Venus D-Lite.
How'd it feel for you up
on the runway?
- I was just having a ball.
- Can you turn around
and show me your ponytail?
That is really, I think,
the best part of your outfit.
I think the rest of the outfit
is overdone.
What did Coco Chanel say?
"Before you leave the house,
take one thing off"?
You've got the snowflake
and the beaded shoes
and then the beaded lapel.
I mean, it's a lot goin' on.
- Of the fabrications you
selected,
the whole mix isn't really
working for me.
You look like
a sad Christmas elf.
- The choices that I had
to make an outfit--
it was very limited.
And I'm saving the best
for later.
- Well, Venus, as you know,
in this competition,
with $75,000 at stake,
everything you do counts.
So that's not really an excuse.
Next, Mimi Imfurst.
You've got such a big heart.
- Thank you!
[laughter]
I've got a big everything, girl.
I actually only weigh 98 pounds.
The rest of this is liver.
- Ah!
[laughter]
- It's really a twist on
something that
is very religious,
and you are making it delightful
and campy
and really putting a spin on it.
- You have a great concept.
There's a amateurish quality
about it, but I love it.
I think it all works.
- Santa Claus,
meet the Virgin Mary.
- I think you're show business.
You're what it's about.
And you had a concept,
and you had an execution,
and you've been carrying
that baby longer
than Rose Kennedy
carried 12 children.
[laughter]
- I'm kind of surprised,
in some ways,
that you have
said such kind words.
You guys have sort
of renewed my faith today
in doing what you trust
in your heart.
- Thank you, Mimi.
Raja, you won
the photo challenge.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Flawless.
- It's obvious to me
you have incredible style.
You work this runway
like a supermodel.
- And you're not taking yourself
too seriously,
which kind of embodies, like,
the whole well-rounded,
like, drag superstar kind
of thing that we're going for.
- For me, it's what, like,
drag artistry is all about.
It's just doing something
unexpected
and creating it out of nothing.
- This is what I do, you know?
I'm a runway girl, I'm a model.
I'm<i> Supermodel of the World,</i>
the sequel,
I'd like to say.
[laughter]
- The only thing that I might
suggest is
that you project a little more
in your voice.
- I mean, I can certainly
speak louder,
but she's making me nervous,
so...
[giggles]
- Thank you, ladies.
Thank you, Bruce.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Let's start with Carmen.
- Carmen brought bo-dy.
I'm still mesmerized
how she tucked all that stuff--
I don't know
where the heck it went,
but it was an amazing tuck.
The one thing I thought might
have lacked was her personality.
- Although, I'm sort of a sucker
for that "Joisey,"
you know, thing like dat,
you know.
- I wanted more Jersey.
I have no idea who Carmen is,
at this point, but a body.
- What about Manila Luzon?
- I think she is gorgeous.
She really embodied the spirit
of a winter wonderland.
- The only thing I might say is
she's funny and engaging
for a cocktail party
but not really
in an entertainment,
kind of showbiz-y kinda way.
- Right.
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- I did think that her outfit
looked a little unfinished.
She could have done better.
- She kind of flubbed it.
- I don't know if Shangela
has the consistency
to make it further
in this competition.
- The personality supersedes
her tailoring skills.
I really wanna see some other
side of Shangela,
and it would be unfortunate
to send her home now.
- Venus D-Lite.
- She was a sad extra in some
kind of, you know, bad--
-<i> It's a Horrible Life.</i>
[laughter]
Her face is beautiful, but you
can't come out on the challenge
and the ponytail be the
highlight of your ensemble.
- That's true.
- Even though the outfit and
everything was very amateurish,
I was hoping she'd redeem
herself with her personality.
But she was inarticulate
and just wasn't engaging.
- Mimi Imfurst!
Her outfit was a little sloppy,
but it was effective.
- I thought it was hilarious
that she used something that's
so iconic and turned it into
something that was flirty
and funny.
- You know I live for camp drag,
but I'm really concerned that
that's her shtick
and that's what she falls on.
I wanna see if she can do
something else.
- Raja.
How 'bout that?
- She brings couture
and a sense of ownership
as soon as she stepped out
on the runway.
- Yes.
- And then the delight was
watching her drop to the ground
and being fun.
And that was
a great combination.
- I did wish she would project
her voice a little more
and kind of be a little more
in your face.
- Right, you not just look like
a supermodel...
- Act like one.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Let's get down to it.
Mimi Imfurst.
You showed us
that big girls do cry.
Now I'm really gonna give you
something to cry about.
Condragulatons.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I just couldn't believe it.
I was for sure I was
in the bottom two.
I was for sure.
- Manila Luzon.
You have a muff to die for.
You're safe.
Condragulations.
Venus...
you were outshined
on the runway.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru said I was
in the bottom two, I was...
I was devastated.
- Raja.
With your photo, fashion,
and frolic in the snow...
you are the queen
who stole Christmas.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
And Raja, you receive immunity
from elimination next week.
Plus, you'll receive a $2,000
gift certificate from
SequinQueen.com.
That's SequinQueen.com.
- I'm so proud of myself.
I worked really hard, and
I was really focused about this.
And it feels really great.
- Carmen Carrera, you have
the body of death...
but do you have the killer
instinct it takes to win?
Shangela, I've given you
a second chance,
but your holiday presentation
left us a little frosty.
Carmen, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Shangela, my dear,
you are up for elimination.
- I'm in disbelief.
A year later,
and here I am again,
in the bottom two.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked
to prepare a lip-sync
performance
of Vanessa Williams'<i> </i>
<i>The Right Stuff.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch...
for your life!
Good luck, and don't...
fuck it up.
[telephone rings]
-<i> I really wanna be here.</i>
<i>I'm determined to fight</i>
<i>to be here.</i>
- Venus gets physical.
But you know what?
Even when pushed,
you can't stop me.
- Miss Venus throws her ponytail
to the back of the stage.
If she would have hit me
with that hair,
I probably would have
had to sock her.
- The lip-synching is starting
to get a little violent.
- Shangela's lamp shade
has become a weapon.
- Shangela's doing what
she's supposed to be doing.
She's supposed to be
lip-synching and performing,
and Venus is just really
pouncing on her.
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
- Ladies...
I must admit, that
made me feel uncomfortable.
I expect my queens to...
outshine each other,
not outgun each other.
But I have made my decision.
Shangela...
Shantay. You stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[sniffling]
[crying]
- Venus D-Lite...
tonight you may be leaving
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race ...</i>
but you're returning
to the constellation
of great drag stars.
Shine on, Venus, shine on.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you for this wonderful
experience
from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm happy, I'm sad,
I'm pissed off.
I think I should still be here.
I think I had a lot more
to bring to the table.
And I don't think I was given
that opportunity.
- Ladies,
now, this competition has raised
the bar on drag worldwide.
There's only one way to go,
and that's up.
So take me higher.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- Let the music play.
<i>Grand prize contributed</i>

It's Christmastime

[cheers and applause]
[dramatic music]
- Hallelu, ladies!
[people cheering]
- What the fuck?
- Hi!
- I don't know
what I was thinking.
And if I have to lip synch,
I'll motherfucking lip-sync
my life off.
- Oh, it's Venus D-Lite.
Mimi Imfurst.
Shangela.
Raja.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Two queens stand before me.
- I'm in disbelief.
A year later,
and here I am again
in the bottom two.
- Shangela, shantay, you stay.
Venus D-Lite, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- And tonight...
are you ready to have
some psychic fun?
The dolls gaze into the future.
- And it's out of this world.
Prepare to gag on my eleganza.
- With extra special
guest judges
<i>Caprica's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Alessandra Torresani</i>
and the legendary Lily Tomlin.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

And may the best woman win.
[tires screech]
- Oh.
- Here we go, ladies.
- Oh, hallelujah.
No more snow.
- Oh, thank god.
- Oh, she left a message.
- "Don't be shady.
Be a lady."
- We had our first elimination.
I see Venus' message
on the mirror,
and it's just a finalization
that one of my sisters from home
is now gone,
and I'm feeling
completely vulnerable.
- I've never done this before,
'cause I was the first one to go
last time.
It's what happens
when you push Shangela.
[laughter]
I survived.
But I don't even feel like
the same Shangela.
I'm battered, bruised.
My spirit is beat down.
- Well, glad you're still here,
Curly.
- Oh, thank you.
- Just stay here longer,
and don't wear none of them
crazy-ass outfits.
- Okay, well...
Manila's coming over
to talk to me,
and all I hear really is,
"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
I just don't want to be
bothered.
- I know you have some cute
drag up in here, so...
- I do.
I actually do have a lot
of good stuff in here.
- Do you think Venus
should have gone home?
- Yes.
It's all about a line of
professionalism.
You know, we all want this,
like, really bad,
but you guys will never have to
deal with that with me.
The competition part
has really kicked in.
You're like, "People really do
go home."
Everything we've worked for
and wanted for so long
is over like that.
- Venus is gone.
The jig is up.
Let's see what's next.
I'm pushing myself 100% forward
and harder to stay here.
I think Shangela, she need to be
very careful,
'cause the queens in this season
are really fierce,
including me first.
- If I was to go home at that
moment, I would have...
[sighs]
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got she-mail.
Drag, the final frontier.
These are the voyages
of the starship<i> Drag Race,</i>
a one-year mission
to boldly tuck
where no man has tucked before.
[men exclaiming]
Set a corset for warp speed,
because this mothership is
about to blast off.
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Look at you all.
For today's mini challenge,
I'm looking for two ladies
with a little something extra.
I'm talking about ESP,
extrasensory perception.
I need you to pair up
with the queen
you feel the strongest
psychic connection with.
The one team that gets the most
correct matches wins.
Raja, you'll be giving
mental vibrations,
and, Delta, you'll be receiving.
- Delta and I are very
psychically connected,
or at least I hope we are,
because Delta knows a lot
about me.
Delta knows how many cab drivers
I've slept with.
Delta knows all kinds of shit.
- Delta, what wig
is Raja wearing?
- It's brunette.
- What color ring?
- The white diamond.
- The white diamond.
Last question.
What color is the pussycat?
[cat meows]
- Pink.
- So, Phoenix, what color boa
is Mariah wearing?
- Day-Glo green.
- What color is the pussycat?
- This is definitely
a black pussycat.
- I don't know where she got the
lime green boa from,
but everybody needs a black
pussycat in their life.
- All right, Carmen,
please send it hard.
[whip cracks]
Ow--ow.
Oh, okay.
Girl's wearing a purple boa.
- Okay.
Stacy Layne Matthews,
what color pussycat?
- I'll say a pink pussycat.
- I'm gonna say pink.
- Okay, a pink wig.
- Yes.
- All right.
- Let me find it.
Let me find it.
- Find it, honey.
- It's coming through.
It's coming through.
And she's wearing the green one.
- The green one.
- Yes.
- All right.
Now, I've tested your ESP.
And the winning team
is Phoenix and Mariah.
[cheers and applause]
How about that?
The next drag superstar
has to prove
that her charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
is truly out of this world.
Now, for today's main challenge,
you'll be shooting scenes for
the new sci-fi movie saga...
[voice echoing]
<i>Drag Queens in Outer Space.</i>
You'll be splitting up
into two teams.
Phoenix and Mariah, together
you won the mini challenge,
but now you are
competing captains.
men: Ooh!
- I see Phoenix,
she's my rival now,
and I think I'm gonna
wear her out.
- I definitely have leadership
experience.
I could totally win
this competition, yeah.
- Now, Phoenix,
go ahead and choose
the first member of your team.
- Raja.
- Mariah.
- Arianna.
- Delta.
- Alexis.
- Ooh!
- They all fools, 'cause I have
an acting company.
So their loss
if they don't pick me.
- India.
- Shangela.
- Manila.
- High-five, team.
- Stacy.
Of course had to get with
big girl Miss Stacy, honey.
- Phoenix, two are left,
Carmen and Mimi.
Who are you choosing?
- Carmen.
- Carmen's coming on over,
which of course means that Mimi
is going to Mariah's side.
- By not picking me, the other
team is gonna be sorry.
[people cheering]
- I'm on Phoenix's team,
and I feel amazing.
I feel like that's,
like, the dream team.
We have, like, the most talent.
I'm looking across the room,
and I'm like, "Ugh.
A bunch of boogers."
- In these two envelopes, I have
two scripts,
<i>Drag Queens in Outer Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and the sequel,<i> </i>
<i>Return to Uranus.</i>
- Thank you.
- Now, your sci-fi movie
trailers
will make their world debut
on the main stage tomorrow.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
- All right.
Let's go scandalous.
I want to be Boobarella.
Hermaphrodite, which is this
genderfuck evil queen,
mannish and womanly
at the same time,
and is absolutely jealous
of Boobarella's beauty.
- The villainess,
Hermaphrodite, is Mimi.
Fitting.
You better get your Oscar,
bitch.
- I'm gonna give you
Meryl Streep realness.
You got to get ugly
to win the prize.
- And, Tweaker,
this is perfect for you,
an alien space monkey.
The twinbots,
sexy robot twins.
Okay.
- Yes.
- I didn't want to pair up
with Shangela.
I mean, I haven't seen
no improvement.
She said she had worked
the whole entire year.
Where?
- We're filming
our sci-fi trailer today,
and we have to learn lines.
We got to make costumes.
- Yay, we have a great cast.
- Our cast is great, yes.
- We're gonna really win this.
- All right,
let's go over our lines.
- I feel like...
- Everybody, okay.
Let's start--start just going
over this.
- [clears throat]
- Phoenix's leadership skills
are a little questionable.
- All right, y'all ready?
- If you go to Mexico.
- It's actually a lot to
memorize.
- I think she was afraid and
really didn't assert herself.
Let's do our table reading.
- Okay.
- Bimborella,
looking for these?
- [high-pitched babbling]
- That's right, Tweaker.
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port aboard.
- Twinbots, stay
on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout.
- Y'all need to, like, come up
with a voice.
I don't want you to just use
your normal voice.
You're, like, robots.
- Rosie the robot, she wasn't
really that robot-y.
Her voice was kind of normal,
and...
- Yeah, we can be like,
"Oh, wait a minute."
- And in unison together.
- Yeah.
- Maybe I should have been
team leader.
- Lady Tata's been kidnapped?
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.
- The ship is surrounded
by a force field...
[laughs]
- We're trying to rehearsal,
and Mimi's being loud.
She's acting like
we're not there.
- I am...your father.
And your mother!
- Back off, Hermaphrodite.
- Your weapons are no good
here.
- That's not the line, baby.
"Your weapons won't work here."
- "Your weapons won't work
here."
- Read it.
- I got it, girl.
You get the punctuation
in your line.
I'll get my lines, all right?
- But just read the script.
You're doing your thing.
No tea.
Just read the scripts.
- Let's refocus.
Let's refocus.
- Mimi already is trying to show
that she is the star
of this group,
that she's standing out.
Miss Mimi, we know
you're talented, honey.
We know you have
the theater background.
Can we get through
one read-through, please?
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hey, Ru!
- Now, I'm just checking in
on my budding starlets.
all: Hey, Ru.
- Let's start with Team Phoenix,
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>
- That's right.
- Now who's playing what role?
- We've got Delta playing
Boobarella.
- Okay.
Pleasure to meet you.
Phoenix, I'm surprised
you didn't take the lead,
Boobarella, for yourself.
- I think she will make
an amazing Boobarella.
She's got this one.
Look--hello!
She's got it.
- And what is Manila playing?
- This is the Tweaker.
- Tweaker the she-monkey?
- Yes.
- That's hot.
You do have to create
your own language.
- Yes.
- Can you give us a little
taste of what that sounds like?
- I'm gonna be like...
[high-pitched babbling]
- That's beautiful.
- She ordered the Cobb salad.
- Yeah, she...
[laughter]
Now, I want to hear the twins do
a line together.
- Twinbots,
stay on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
[both giggle]
- [laughs]
Oscar!
All right, ladies, work hard.
I don't want to see drag queens;
I want to see movie stars.
All right, get to work.
all: Thank you.
- Team Mariah.
- Hey, Ru, what's happening?
- The cast of<i> Return to Uranus.</i>
This is an epic.
Now, Mariah, what role
are you playing?
- Uh, the milkmaid.
[laughter]
No, I'm playing Boobarella.
- You assigned yourself
the lead role.
- Actually, I think it was
slightly unanimous.
- [laughs]
Now, you all picked the sequel.
As you well know, most of
the time, sequels suck.
So you have your work cut out
for you.
Make sure
that it's a hit picture.
- Yes.
- All right,
I'm gonna leave you ladies
to get camera ready.
- Cool.
- Good luck.
all: Thank you.
- Ladies, on the set, you'll be
visited by Michelle Visage
and our extra-special
guest judge,
the star of the sci-fi series
<i>Caprica,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my favorite Cylon,
Alessandra Torresani.
- Oh, awesome.
[applause]
- Alessandra Torresani.
She is fierce.
- Now, they'll be here
to give you some pointers.
This is your chance to shine.
So lights, camera,
and don't fuck it up.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Got it.
- Good luck, bitches.
- Good luck.
- Thanks, baby.
- I want to know why was I
fucking picked last.
- I don't know.
Why do you think?
- Do you think Phoenix
didn't pick me on purpose?
- I don't know.
- I heard she was--I heard that
she was threatened by me.
- She's threatened by you?
- Or she thought I was
her competition.
- I mean, if she's threatened
by you,
then she would think
that you were good,
and then that would be a benefit
to her
to have you on her team.
- Yeah.
- If she was strategizing
the way you think
she's strategizing.
- I just don't know.
- I didn't think that Phoenix
was threatened by her.
Phoenix hasn't mentioned that.
And I don't know what she could
possibly be threatened by.
Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first,
and I don't even think
she's second.
I don't think anyone's placing
any bets on her.
- Hey, hey.
- Team Phoenix is on the set
of<i> Drag Queens in Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>
- Greetings, ladies.
all: Hi.
- I'd like to introduce you to
our guest judge today.
This is Alessandra.
- Hi, guys.
How are you?
- We will be directing
your performances today.
Let's get this show on the road.
- Let's do it.
- Bring it.
- Okay.
- Take one.
- Tata, twinbots,
we must intercept
the queen's spaceship,
or the balls will be held
in Uranus...
forever.
- Cut!
Delta.
- Yes.
- The line is "the queen's balls
will be<i> stuck</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in Uranus forever."
"Stuck" is the punch.
- Okay.
We must intercept
Hermaphrodite's spaceship,
or the queen's balls will be
stuck in her anus.
- That would be "Uranus."
Just so we're clear,
it's "Uranus."
It's a planet.
Family show, honey.
- At this point, I realize
I should have probably spent
more time
memorizing my lines
than primping my hair.
- Action.
- We've arrived on
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port
in three, two, one.
all: Dragonauts away!
- Phoenix, you're delivering
all your lines
away from the camera.
We need to see
your gorgeous face.
- Okay.
- Tata, twinbots,
stay on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.
- Phoenix.
- Yes?
- You keep looking away, girl.
You're giving somebody else
your time.
- Okay.
- I'm like, "Bitch,
just get it together."
- Phoenix, what's your
character feeling right now?
- I think I'm kind of...
I don't really know.
- Exactly.
- Phoenix, let's say that you
are super scared.
- Okay.
- But you're trying
not to show it,
because you're trying to
impress Boobarella.
- Let's give you one more shot,
Phoenix.
Full of emotion, baby.
We know you got it.
- Okay.
- Twinbots, be on the lookout.
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.
all: Dragonauts, away!
- Cut.
Okay, Raja and Manila.
- The idea of having
Michelle Visage sitting there
terrifies me a little bit,
because that woman scares me.
- And action.
- [chitters]
[laughter]
- I'm wearing the smallest
little leotard,
and I'm getting
a huge cameltoe.
Tweaker got pipe.
- Manila, you're all ears,
girl.
- Hmm?
[laughter]
- Action.
- The most gorgeous woman
in the universe?
Don't you need to be a woman
first?
- Kill 'em, Tweaker!
- Whaaa!
[imitating lasers firing]
- Manila, do not make fake
sound effect gun noises.
It's not your backyard.
It's a movie, darlings.
- I don't know.
- Just look gorgeous
and do your lines.
Action!
- Say what?
- Action?
- Oh.
[laughter]
- Lady Tata is to become...
my bride.
- Lady Tata would never marry
a Martian like you.
- Cut. Tata, you're giving us
Maya Angelou.
Give us just a little bit more
Maya Angelou.
- Okay.
[laughter]
- I am from Crab Nebula, bitch!
- Yeah, Mimi, take it back
a little bit.
- Okay.
- Lower the energy
a little bit.
- Okay.
- Action!
- [screams]
- Miss Mimi.
There's a difference
in being talented
and being a showboat.
- Boobarella, I see you've
increased your war chest.
- Can I get the line?
- "Prepare to gag on my"...
- Thank you.
Prepare to gag on my eleganza!
[shrieks]
both: Get her, Boobarella!
- Shut the fuck up.
- No!
"Go fuck yourself."
- Go fuck yourself.
My lines have to be fed to me
a little bit,
and I'm like, "Oh, my god.
Please do not let me lead
these ladies off a cliff."
- [high-pitched babbling]
both: Has anyone ever told you
you look like an Ewok?
- The hardest part of my role
is to have to share it
with Shangela.
I wanted my spotlight.
both: Stop flirting!
You stop flirting!
Shut up!
No, you shut up!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Alexis and I,
as the twinbots,
we delivered when
we hit that set.
both: Dragonauts, away!
- And cut.
Nicely done.
Okay, that's a wrap, ladies.
Congratulations.
[cheers and applause]
Your sci-fi trailers will make
their world premiere
on the main stage tomorrow.
[cheers and applause]
Very exciting.
And Ru has asked you all to come
decked out in your finest
space-age couture.
[people gasp]
And we will be joined
by our extra-special, far-out
guest judge,
the legendary Lily Tomlin.
[cheers and applause]
- Lily motherfucking Tomlin.
You--you really--you don't get
better than that.
- All right, so until then,
live long and prosper.
[cheering]
[alarm beeps]
- Just as we left it.
- We're back in the work room.
Today we're getting ready for
the runway,
and we're all gonna get
decked up
in our shiny, metallic,
futuristic realness.
Miss Manila?
- Yeah?
- My hair is sticking through
in that wig.
Can you trim it?
- What, shave your hair?
- No, I just need you
to just trim the back.
- Can't you get someone else,
like the Delta or someone,
that does hair to do it?
- Mimi starts asking
the other queens,
"Will someone come over
and shave my head?"
Girl, what if I shave my head?
- And maybe have, like,
a little piece of hair
hanging down on the side?
That would be cute.
And have, like, a little
spit curl in the front.
- Do you want
to shave it real quick?
- Oh, uh-uh.
I don't have time, babe.
- I understand going
the extra mile,
but this is nothing but Mimi
pulling another production.
Her name should be
Cimi Imfurst,
because every time
we turn around,
she's doing something
for someone
to "see me, see me, see me."
- I feel so vulnerable.
I didn't hit the mark
in the challenge.
I wish I would have spent
a little more time
memorizing my lines,
because I expected more
from myself.
I hate how this thing, like--
you know what I mean?
Like, how is that even
a tight bobbin?
Like, that is not even
gonna work.
Now my job is to amp up
what it is that I wear,
how I conduct myself
on the runway.
I need to basically give 300%,
not 100%,
'cause it's just not enough.
Forget it. I'm using
somebody else's machine.
- [gasps]
How cyborg.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, your look is gonna be
on point.
- We will see.
I am team leader.
You know, I want to make sure
everything's perfect.
I need it to be on point.
I'm, like, a fucking nerv--
I, like, never get nervous.
- Why was I the villain?
Do you think of me as a villain?
- Yeah.
- How so?
- You could be antagonistic
if you--
- [laughs]
- Mimi, do you feel
that you worked well
with everyone in the group?
- I think so.
I think we had definitely
some clashing, but--
- Who clashed?
- I think you and I clashed,
girl.
- I think it's because
we both have
very strong personalities.
We both had an idea
of how we wanted the production
and our role to go.
But in the end,
you have to release
and trust each actor to be able
to take the role on
and put their own self into it.
- I'm really proud
of my performance
in the trailer.
I really think I hit it
out of the park.
- Shangela underestimated me,
but I know what I can do,
and now she does too.
So you're cool?
Me and you cool?
- Girl, we're always cool.
Listen, you can take nothing
personal in this life.
- Indeed.
- It has to be really severe.
- I look over, and Mimi puts on
this headpiece,
and I think she looks like
Uncle Fester
from<i> Addams Family,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> honestly.</i>
- Mimi looks ridiculous.
If that's what the future has
in hold for me
or for my kids
or for my grandkids,
I'm--I'm scared.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
- Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
So what do you think
of my dress?
both: Whoo-hoo!
- Are those pussy willows?
- They sure are.
Santino, you've got it
every time.
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, my darlin'.
- Are you ready to have a close
encounter of the drag kind?
- I am tweaking my knobs
and setting a course direct
for the Milky Way.
- [laughs]
- Bring it.
- Alessandra Torresani.
My favorite Cylon.
You look gorgeous.
- You do as well.
- And the great Lily Tomlin
is here.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Now, this week, our girls made
their film debut
in the sci-fi saga<i> </i>
<i>Drag Queens From Outer Space.</i>
Now, decked out in their best
futurama glamorama,
they're ready for a blastoff.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
Space age.
- When I dress up, I'm always
looking for perfection
and a complete look,
and that's my strength.
- Does that outfit come
with solar panels?
Get ready for Raja.
- Whoo!
- All right, Miss Raja.
- C-3PO's girlfriend.
- Yes.
- Any time I'm on the runway,
I'm sparkling.
I'm having a blast up there, and
I'm doing my robot runway.
- The queen who fell to Earth.
Up next...
Wow, look at those.
- Oh.
- You're gonna put
somebody's eyes out
with those things.
- I'm feeling 100% diva
in my whole space costume.
Very Gaga,
very Christina Aguilera,
very Britney
all mixed into one.
- She's a galaxy girl.
- Yes, she is.
Up next...
Oh, wow!
Flash Gordon does drag.
- I'm just trying to show
in the runway
that I'm a little Power Ranger,
and I am feeling on fire.
- Wonder Woman
from outer space.
Her clone does not sleep alone.
- I'm in a body suit,
for god's sakes.
Just having curves
and just being able to walk
down the runway
and have the judges look at you
made me feel really good.
- Danger, Will Robinson.
Stacy Layne Matthews
is on the run.
Next, Shangela.
- Ooh.
- Shangela's
a real bubble head.
- Captain Shangela.
- She's a Starship Trooper.
- So I'm on the runway,
and I'm, like, "Ooh,
this is super hot."
I feel so much more confident
hitting it the second time back.
- The queen
of the space cadets.
Beam me up.
Up next, Mimi Imfurst.
Supersonic.
- My headpiece is inspired by
the planet Krypton.
I'm just going
to make my look be
as out of this world
as possible.
- Oh!
- Oh, my god, those eyes.
- She's serving satellite TV.
Oh, my stars.
That's some kind of futuristic
chastity belt.
- So I'm on the runway, praying
I don't trip over these shoes,
'cause they are a bitch
to walk in,
praying they like it.
But I'm feeling good.
- Kiss me. I dare ya.
From planet New Jersey...
She's blinding me with science.
- I'm walking that runway,
and I'm thinking,
"This hair better not come off,
"and I'm gonna keep my neck as
perched as I can,
"and I'll just shake my ass
a little bit
and just hope for the best."
- She's an astronaut.
- She's got a mind
for rocket science
but a body for sin.
Look who we have here.
Representing Atlanta, Mariah.
- Our hair looks very similar,
doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
- I truly feel like supermodel
of the universe.
I am stomping that runway.
- She's not having any trouble
with her Tribbles.
All right, Delta Work.
She's giving us a total eclipse
of the heart.
- I'm hoping the judges are
going to love the difference
between what I'm wearing
and the sort of
metal-colored-inspired costumes
that they're seeing.
- She's a real Judy Jetsetter.
Next up, Manila Luzon.
That ensemble is just rocking
my universe.
- I'm coming down the runway,
and I'm giving evil henchwoman
realness.
I kind of wanted to separate
myself from the other girls,
because I think a lot of girls
kind of had, like,
a similar look.
- She's got a big dipper too.
- She sure do.
- Welcome, dolls.
Now it's blockbuster time.
Team Phoenix, let's take a look
at your trailer.
Help me, Boobarella.
You're my only hope.
- Whoo!
- Delta Work as Boobarella.
- I have a hunch things are
about to get a little ugly.
Twinbots, be on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
[laughter]
- Carmen Carrera and
India Ferrah as the twinbots.
both: Resetting course.
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three...
- Phoenix as Lady Tata.
- Two, and one.
- [laughs]
[warbling]
Bimborella.
You looking for these?
both: Give us back those balls.
- Sarlaccs!
- Raja as Hermaphrodite.
- No one can hear you
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die.
- [high-pitched babbling]
- That's right, Tweaker.
- And Manila Luzon as Tweaker.
- Whoo!
Shama-la-la-la-la bing bong.
[weapons whooshing]
[laughter]
- Cute.
Wonderful.
- The other group
was all over the map.
I'm feeling really confident.
I think we could win this thing.
- Next up, Team Mariah.
Let's take a look at the sequel.
- [cackling]
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.
- Mariah as Boobarella.
- [shrieks]
There's something
I want you to know!
I am...your father.
- Mimi Imfurst as
Hermaphrodite.
- And your mother!
- Go fuck yourself.
- I did!
That's why I'm your father
and your mother!
- Ew!
- Stacy Layne Matthews
as Lady Tata.
- The gas levels indicate
that Uranus is burning.
both: Hey, Tweaker.
Stop flirting.
You stop flirting.
Shut up!
No, you shut up.
- Shangela and Alexis Mateo
as the twinbots.
- [screeching]
- Tweaker, no!
- Yara Sofia as Tweaker.
all: Dragonauts, away!
- Damn you, Boobarella...
Ella--ella--ay--ay--ay.
[screams]
[laughter]
- I am so happy, 'cause I was
so worried about my accent.
But it actually came out
very cute.
I'm so proud of myself
right now.
- Ladies, the reviews are in.
And based on your<i> Drag Queens</i>
<i>in Outer Space</i><span style="bodyStyle"> movie trailers,</i>
we've made some decisions.
The winning team is...
[dramatic music]
Team Mariah,<i> Return to Uranus.</i>
[people cheering]
Condragulations.
You are all safe.
- Thank you.
- Yes!
- But three of you emerged as
breakout stars.
Shangela.
Alexis.
The twinbots.
Mimi Imfurst.
- I'm feeling super confident.
Comparing myself
to everyone else in my group,
I think that I stand a good
chance of winning this one.
- I can only choose one.
Oh, damn the rules.
Let's call it a tie.
Shangela, Alexis,
condragulations.
You have won this challenge.
Each of you will receive a set
of hand-sculpted silicone
breastplates
courtesy of boobsforqueens.com.
[cheering and laughing]
Did you hear that, Lily?
Boobsforqueens.com.
- Yes, I did.
[laughter]
- However, neither one of you
will be granted immunity
next week.
Team Mariah.
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.
Team Phoenix.
Each of you is up for
elimination
except, of course, for Raja.
You have immunity.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Phoenix.
What'd you think of Lady Tata?
- I think you could have been
a little zanier,
especially with a name like
Lady Tata.
- I do believe that you were
the weakest link in this cast.
- You just didn't commit.
Because you had fewer lines,
you should have committed 150%
just to show up everyone else.
- India Ferrah.
- I was very taken
with your bosoms.
I thought they were just
completely believable--
from this distance, anyway.
- I love, love, love this look.
- Thank you.
- This is Judy Jetson
does Vegas.
- Thank you, India.
All right, up next,
Carmen Carrera.
Now, Carmen, you're having some
trouble with your headpiece.
- This is, like, kind of
a mixture of super glue
and spray adhesive to my head.
It's literally pulling the hairs
out of my scalp.
- It's such an extraordinary
waistline.
It's just incredible.
You must have had a rib removed.
- I think your outfit today
is poorly conceived
and poorly designed.
- Carmen, stop relying
on that body.
- All right.
Thank you, Carmen.
Manila,
tell us about your outfit.
- I wanted to do, like, a
really sexy, like, Grace Jones,
Thierry Mugler-inspired,
like, catsuit.
- Well, you failed.
- [laughs]
- No, just joking.
- I thought your character
was great.
- Thank you.
- Very original and unexpected
and totally committed.
- Thanks, Manila.
Delta Work!
- You could've gone way out
with that Boobarella character.
You seemed more like a
combination of divine and Dali.
And I liked that.
- What is futuristic
about this look?
It looks a little dated, and
other than it being shiny,
I don't see space.
I don't see sci-fi.
I don't see the future.
- I sort of was inspired
by the look of that 1950s
and '60s feeling
of what space-age would be.
- Now, what about
her performance as Boobarella?
- In the performance aspect,
you had to do
a million things at once.
I think for your first time
on film,
I think that was a very hard
character for you to play,
but you did listen to us.
- All right, ladies.
I want a piece of advice
from you.
Who should be going home
tonight?
Manila.
- I think...
Phoenix.
She was our leader,
and I think that the leader
has to take responsibility.
Carmen.
- I kind of agree with Manila.
She was our leader.
- India.
- Phoenix,
one of the first things
she actually told us to do
was, you know, change our voices
for our characters,
so that's one of the things that
I expected from her as well.
- All right, Phoenix.
- I think for you to come out
in just a catsuit
that I have 15 of,
I don't really think
that's worth $75,000.
- But you're wearing
a catsuit.
- I think that I've got
so much more of a $75,000 look.
- Manila, is there something
you want to say
about your $75,000 catsuit?
- [laughs]
- I got this made for $100,
so I guess I could make
75...uh, hundred.
- Do the math, honey.
- I'm Asian,
but I don't do math.
[laughter]
Sorry.
- All right.
All right, Delta,
it's your turn.
Who do you think should go home
tonight?
- Based on the runway
presentation,
I would say myself.
- All right, Raja.
- I just don't like the idea of
the possibility
of my friend leaving,
'cause Delta and I--
I was so excited to see my
very good friend here with me
in this process.
I hope that if she has to
lip-synch for her life,
that she fucking lip-syncs
for her mother[bleep] life.
You know what I'm saying?
- Amen.
- Thank you, Raja.
Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you untuck in
The Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, ladies, ladies.
Just between us girls,
let's start with Phoenix.
- I was gagging.
She was horrible, and she didn't
look very good either.
- She was definitely nervous
the whole time.
- But her runway ensemble today
looked really futuristic
and great.
- India Ferrah.
- Well, I liked her costume.
It was nicely pulled together
and interesting.
- I was saying, are we gonna
see the boobs every time?
- I have a feeling, yes.
- Yeah?
- [laughs]
- On to Carmen.
- I didn't think her costume
was well designed.
- It's a bikini with a corset.
- She came out, and she had
her sort of head pulled down
so that the thing--I thought
she had osteoporosis.
- You wanted to give her
some calcium.
- Yes!
Is she out of her league?
- She needs to step up
her game.
- Now Manila.
She took what could have been
a disaster of a role,
and she ran with it.
- Oh, yeah.
She was great.
- Delta Work.
When she described what she was
doing, a retro look,
I understood it.
It's just the execution of it
wasn't well done.
Did she have trouble
with her dialog?
- She did indeed.
We had to go over that
quite a few times.
But she really wanted to get it
right, bless her heart.
She wasn't like...
[scoffs]
Like, she really was listening
and really took the direction.
I thought we were happy
with some of the decisions
she made as an actress.
- Now, the decisions she made
as a stylist
on the runway tonight,
not so much?
- She's contacting
a different person in her head.
- Yeah.
- It didn't look Judy Jetson.
- I felt like when she was
standing next to everybody else,
she felt, like, almost sheepish.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Raja, you have immunity.
- Yes, I do.
- You're safe.
- Thanks.
- Manila, you had us at...
[high-pitched babbling]
Condragulations.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Phoenix, now, as team leader
and Lady Tata,
you let us down.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I do not want to go home
up against people that are
not as good as I am.
- India Ferrah.
Condragulations, you are safe.
Carmen.
Your runway presentation was
weak and lacked vision.
Delta,
your Boobarella was curvaceous,
but your look on the main stage
left us flat.
Carmen...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Delta, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
- I knew that Ru was gonna
announce me
to lip-sync for my life.
I don't know that I should have
been there,
but I didn't think our entire
team should have been there.
I mean, I thought it was a load
of crap.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- Get it, bitch.
I want them to see the fire
that is in my eyes right now.
- I see Phoenix, you know,
copying a few of Gaga's moves,
and I think that's just poor
entertainment, honestly.
Don't copy anyone else.
And Delta was being herself,
and, you know, not trying to be
Lady Gaga.
- I'm not trying to be shady
in any way,
but Phoenix is a man
doing movements.
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!
[applause]
- Wow.
- Phoenix.
Delta.
I have made my decision.
Delta Work.
Shantay, you stay.
- [exhales]
Thank you very much.
[applause]
- [whispers] I'm so happy.
- Phoenix.
Rising from the ashes.
For a great queen like you,
this is just the beginning.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
[applause]
- We love you.
- For me to go home and some of
these people remain
is very crazy to me,
especially when I look
at certain people
in this competition
that definitely are not the best
that America has to offer.
- Ladies, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" in here?
all: Amen!
- Now let the music play.

killer cast of competitors.

little girls.

at the top 12 queens'
audition tapes.
- I really, really like to be
naked.
- Plus unforgettable footage
of some of the ladyboys
who didn't quite make the cut.
- I'm keeping my baby.
- Can I get an "amen"?
- Heer neer.
- And just when you thought
it was safe to go outside...
Shocking.
<i>Drag Race's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first ever</i>
open casting call.
- I will sleep with anybody
if it helps me get the part.
- [gasps]
Get ready for an hour
of amazing transformations...
- [giggles]
- Outrageous fashions...
- Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill?
- And more lip-syncing for
your life than ever before.
- Top that, J.Lo.
- All this and some sexy
pit crew auditions
not suitable for work...
unless you work for me.
So take off your pants,
and let's dance.
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> casting</i>
extravaganza starts now.
- [screams]
- Greetings, race fans.
Welcome to the starting line
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
Months before the competition
begins,
we scour the nation
to bring together the best
drag divas in America.
Get ready to gag on the gaggle
of glamour girls I've gathered
for this go-around.
But before I reveal
this season's top 12 queens,
let's take a look at some of
the home videos sent in
from the thousands of hopefuls
who dream of becoming America's
next drag superstar.
- My name is Miss Kiki,
a.k.a. Antonio Forte.
- Hi, RuPaul.
I'm Jacqueline.
- I am Misty Eyes.
- My name is Yekaterina
Petrovna Zamolodchikova,
but please just call me Katya.
- I'm Dax ExclamationPoint.
I come to you now in a look
that I'm calling--I'm calling
Seth Nando Barbie.
- I am Vivika Westwood Mugler.
Right now, we're in the middle
of the Bronx,
in the middle of the projects,
in the middle of the night.
- My character is very unique,
because I'm kind of bipolar.
- Miss La Fierce is ferocious.
She's...
Arr. Rowr.
Rowr!
- This is Sushi Vega,
the fiercest, baddest bitch
performer in Texas.
And if anybody has anything
to say about it,
they can speak to my mother.
- Hello,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
My name is Andrew Levitt.
I grew up in Canton, Ohio,
which is the Pro Football
Hall of Fame capital.
Then I moved--
- I am the fierce diva
that is going to end up
ruling this country.
- I'm in my car.
That just tells you I'm ready
for the race, doesn't it?
- I'm gonna stop you right now
and tell you that if you do not
cast me, this show's gonna suck.
- Ru, you need somebody
interesting on your show.
- So get me on the show,
heer neer.
- Please pick me.
[giggles]
- All of my dreams have come
true except for one thing!
I need to be
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race!</i>
- I deserve a shot
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> because...</i>
- And if you give me that call,
I can be on my way in a jiffy,
because--well, right now,
I'm bumming, but, you know...
- I really want to be on TV.
-<i> Mami, yo tengo esta</i>
<i>en RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
You have to cast me, mami!
- And if you don't get me on
the show, you better believe
I'm gonna be right here sending
another video tomorrow.
[laughs]
- And so choose me
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
Because let me tell you
about a drag race.
This bitch knows how to run.
Can I get an "amen"?
- Amen.
- Amen. Holla.
- Amen.
- Is that it?
Did we get it?
Amen.
- Those queens ain't too proud
to beg,
and I applaud them for their
shameless self-promotion.
Oh, did I mention my book,
<i>Workin' It!</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide</i>
<i>to Life, Liberty,</i>
<i>and the Pursuit of Style,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is available on Amazon?
I didn't think so.
[ding!]
Now, speaking of selling
themselves,
these next two queens
sold me on the fact
that they were the best
of the best.
So let me introduce the first
queen chosen to compete
in this season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
From New York City,
Manila Luzon.
- Hi, my name's Karl with a K,
not a C.
Hi. I'm Manila.
The thing that I have
that you haven't seen
on your show yet
is that I'm Asian
and I'm taller than 5'2".
I'm Filipino.
Well, my mother's Filipino.
My dad's white.
So I'm a mix.
The Philippines
is the birthplace
of the prison<i> Thriller</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video</i>
and famous for the former
first lady Imelda Marcos.
- My favorite song to perform,
I think, of all times is<i> Vogue.</i>
I actually like
performing it better
as just, like me
and, like, picking out
fashionable clothes
and voguing.
My category is face.
- I have a famous boyfriend.
He's on TV.
You guys might know him
by the name Sahara Davenport.
both: Hi!
- Hey, there, it's me, Sahara,
wishing my baby girl, Manila,
all the best of luck.
And you guys better pick her.
- Looks like Manila's
gonna be a thriller.
The next queen to be competing
this season
is from the Garden State,
New Jersey's own Carmen Carrera.
- Yo, what's up?
This is me, Chris.
And I want to audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Carmen Carrera is this, like,
fly-ass, glamorous girl.
She just has no worries.
I really, really like to be
naked
and just make costumes
out of unordinary things.
The animal-print pasties
with the mohawk,
that's, like, really Carmen.
Like, Carmen likes to be
really naked.
This is my drag closet.
Couple of sexy things,
skirt that I made.
Rhinestone.
My shoes.
I got married last year.
Me and my husband were
extremely happy about that.
He has a four-year-old daughter,
so I'm kind of, like,
stepmother.
I'm going to give you guys
a little runway,
stop some traffic.
Doing drag and performing
is important to me
on a personal level,
because it helps me grow
as an individual
and as an artist.
[RuPaul's<i> Jealous Of My Boogie]</i>
I can perform for people
and have them take something
from my show,
whether it's happiness
or whether it's inspiration.
I really appreciate your time,
and I hope to hear back soon,
all right?
Amen.
[clicks tongue]
- Like a prayer, this Jersey
girl will take you there.
Now, this might surprise you,
but many of the queens
that auditioned
are still in the closet.
It's true.
Of course, they're just in there
playing with dresses and wigs
and pantyhose.
And lucky for you, they invited
us in to take a look.
- I'm gonna show you my closet.
Take a look.
- This is my closet.
I'm gonna take you on a tour.
I have named it
The Interior Illusions Lounge.
- I spend a lot of money
on drag to look cheap, honey,
and I don't need any other bitch
to take it from me.
So, yes, it's a double lock,
as you can see.
- I'm about to show you
Joaya's fierce closet.
So here it is.
This is pretty much her closet.
- Drag closet, drag closet.
Come on. Let's go.
Everything that I have--
my house is so small
that I have to hide it
under the house.
- This is my special closet.
It's my freezer.
- Some people say garage.
I say closet.
- There she is.
- I don't wear
99% of this stuff.
- I wear this to all
the appropriate events,
like family functions, dinners.
- Oh, and listen to it.
[dress rustling]
Merry Christmas.
- Everybody should have
at least one good
straightjacket.
- I go from different looks.
You know, sometimes I'm demure.
Sometimes I'm classy.
Most of the time, I'm whorey.
- This is my closet in all
its--oh, we have bras.
Am I supposed to show this?
- Little bit of cheetah,
leopard, and my zebra.
But one thing you'll never find
on me is beaver.
- I have developed
quite an affinity
for gluing shit
to other shit.
- And then this is my
Space Girl Goes Green.
She, you know--
she a little scandalous.
- This is my alien space queen
outfit.
I hope you like it.
I am a natural green hair.
- This right here
is a lovely feather boa
made out of...
scented trash bags.
- And right here is where I make
my own theatrical rhinestone
jewelry.
- Those are some true
fashion plates.
The first time a man puts on
a wig, some makeup,
and a pair of heels,
and prances out that door
is the ultimate act of courage.
Many of our hopefuls told us
about their first time in drag.
- When I first started
doing drag,
I looked like a five-cent
prostitute clown.
- I started, you know,
a zesty mess in a dirty dress,
like everybody.
You know, my best girlfriend
would do my makeup,
and I'd put on a flat wig
and clothes from the body shop,
and I thought I was real.
And I thought, "Oh, my god,
it's just like prom
but every night."
- I started doing drag,
actually, on Halloween.
And if you would have asked me
back then
if I was gonna be a full-out
drag queen,
my answer definitely
would have been no.
- I was kind of a mess,
you know.
I was walking around.
I was, like--I had that wig on,
and I was roll around,
"Ho ho ho ho."
- I decided I was gonna dress up
as Liza Minnelli
just for one time, and I'm never
gonna do it again.
Shockingly enough,
I had so much fun,
from that point forward,
I knew that I was going to
become the drag queen
that I am today.
- I started doing drag
in Lincoln, Nebraska.
There was a competition
for people who had never
did drag before.
And all my friends were like,
"You should do it."
I'm, like, "I'm not
a drag queen," you know.
So I came in, did that
competition, and won
and beat, like, nine girls.
Like, they say
that I was the girl
that came bucking at the gate.
Like, it was just my calling.
- I used to photograph
drag queens in L.A.
for about a year and a half.
I was just like, "You know what?
"I'm tired of taking pictures
of drag queens.
"I'm going to turn the camera
and the spotlight onto me,
and I'm going
to make it happen."
I started off in this one
little bar in the Castro.
I called all my friends.
I was like, "Bitches, you guys
better be there.
"And even if I suck,
I don't give a shit;
"your asses are gonna scream
like you had just seen Madonna
poop on herself."
- When I was in college,
I was dating a man
who said he'd never sleep
with me again
if he ever saw me in drag.
This devastated me.
But I was answering
to a higher power
the night I picked up the flyer
for Chi Chi Larue's
fishbowl contest.
And you know what?
I walked away
with that fishbowl trophy
and a cash prize.
- Those queens have nerve.
And it do take nerve.
Now, here are two queens who
are ready to let you have it.
A professional makeup artist
who's worked with
some very big names.
Meet Raja.
- My drag character
or my drag name is Raja.
I'll be 36.
I'm a makeup artist,
and I'm a female impersonator.
I'm gonna sound
really fucking old,
but I started really young,
and I've been doing this
for about 20 years now.
As soon as I came out
of the closet, I was like,
"I'm gonna be
a fierce fucking bitch."
So my brows were tweezed.
My hair grew.
I kept my weight
at a certain weight.
I wanted to be a supermodel.
That's all I wanted to be.
I've always known
in the back of my mind
that there's something better
about me than everybody else.
I think I have
a different insight
and an understanding of
the world.
Raja is a jet-setting,
avant-garde supermodel.
She's a little boisterous,
but at the same time,
she's very classy.
We're about to explore
my closet.
Definitely have to be thin.
No fat girls allowed.
[chuckles]
So this is one of the pieces
that I made.
Not bad, right?
Sometimes I go have coffee
in the morning down the street
and I go down through
West Hollywood,
go to the thrift shop
in this gown.
I've been watching<i> Drag Race,</i>
and I'm frankly disappointed
at the collection that these...
men are wearing.
They don't have shit
like this.
I watch them, and they're just
walking around
in their, you know,
home sewing machine, like,
cheap Lycra nonsense.
And, frankly,
I don't understand it,
and I think it's irresponsible,
and I think they need
to get it together.
I'm a makeup artist.
That's what I do.
And I work with a ton of
celebrities.
This is my friend Adam Lambert.
So what do you think about me,
like, trying to become
the next top drag queen?
- You are the top drag queen.
- Oh!
- Those bitches
better look out.
- There you go.
Enough said.
- You're going to kick
their ass.
- Sorry about that.
- Not only is Raja
the prettiest queen;
she's also the most creative
and resourceful
and [speaking indistinctly].
- To me, drag is an art form
and it's a visual art.
And so the more visual it is,
the more powerful it is
and the more important it is.
- This drag veteran
is ready for the race.
You go, mama.
Here's a diva supreme
who comes to<i> Drag Race</i>
with a daunting reputation.
From the Buckeye State,
meet India Farrah.
- My name is Shane Richardson.
I started drag
at a very young age,
at the age of 12, actually.
And my brother,
whom is also gay,
was currently in a relationship
with a drag queen
in my hometown,
who got me started in drag
and gave me the drag name
India Farrah.
Oh, hello.
When did you get here?
No, it's not Kris Kardashian.
It's me, India Farrah.
I started performing
at the age of 14.
There's been some hardships
that I've had to face.
A lot of people actually tried
to bring me down
when I was younger,
because I started so young.
And luckily, with the support of
my family and close friends,
it was a battle that I overcame.
This is my closet,
and I want you to come in
and take a look with me.
This right here is a new wig
that I just created, actually,
and it weighs about 20 pounds.
This is a little fabric boa
that I made.
Makeup, lashes.
I like to keep stock of stuff.
One of my top hats for Rihanna.
This right here
is my galaxy costume,
and I absolutely love it.
[fast-paced music]
Why is drag an important part
of my life?
I would have to say since I was
homeschooled since second grade
by my parents,
that drag allowed me
to be more social and outgoing.
So I think, honestly, drag
helped me out a lot.
And I think that's why I click
to it so much.
- You have seen
my audition video
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
I hope to be seeing you
at the starting line soon.
Can I get an "amen"?
- This dancing queen is gonna
bring the heat to the runway.
You know, my ladyboys aren't
the only ones who have to prove
they've got the right stuff.
I put potential pit crew
candidates
through their paces too.
And trust me; it was grueling.
- My name is Patrick Cronen.
I'm 27.
I did swing for eight years,
but primarily dancing
in the mirror
is how I occupy
my spare time these days.
- I would have to say
I like my stomach the best,
'cause I put the most work
on that.
- I played football for the
University of South Dakota
for five years.
I'm an actor/model, and I can't
dance worth shit.
- I sew, I paint,
and I do an amazing one-handed
hand stand
while humping the wall.
[chuckles]
- I'm a musical theater actor
and dancer.
I'm the biggest pussy
you will ever meet.
I cry at everything.
I got a nice butt.
It's big.
[boing]
- I'm very confident.
I have some Tom Cruise moves.
You need to get ready, actually.
- I do cry at movies.
I'm very emotional.
And I think I'm a good dancer.
Yeah, got a great ass, so...
[laughs]
- I'm a ex-go-go dancer.
My favorite part of my body is
my ding-dong.
[elephant trumpets]
- I'm actually not a dancer
at all.
- So the one thing you probably
would not know about me
is that I can be very buff.
I can look like I'm really
cut up and really ready to go.
But I can also get really skinny
very quickly.
- I have in my blood
the mighty DNA of God.
So I have his blessing.
I can do it all.
both: We are from Russia.
- My age is 21.
- And I'm 18.
Sometimes we dance
in the shower.
- My name is Alien Hanson.
I'm the world's best dancer.
[cymbal crashes]
My career goals are to be famous
and to be a household name
on everybody's TV screen.
- The economy's turned terrible,
as we all well know,
and I turned to male escorting
to put bread on the table,
to feed my family,
and keep the women happy.
I was a<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model,</i><i> </i>
<i>Penthouse</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model for years.</i>
- Yeah, I'm probably a little
too short to be a model.
- You know, everyone sees
my chest,
and it just drowns
everything out, so...
See a little bit of that?
[laughs]
- My name is Shawn.
I'm 31 years old.
I work in outdoor advertising.
My favorite part about my body,
I guess, would be my midsection.
[laughs]
- My favorite aspect of my body
would have to be my abs.
- I love my chest.
That's all.
Other people always comment
on my ass, though.
- Hi, my name is Jason Carter.
I'm 29.
I am a dancer/radio jockey/
host.
That's what I do for a living.
What I like best about my body
is my abs.
- Do you see how I suffer
to bring you this show?
You can thank you me later.
Actually, you can thank me now,
because the season three
pit crew is here.
Say hello, boys.
both: Hello, boys.
- This season, we received
a lot of submissions
from plus-sized ladies.
Let me just say,
the bigger the cushion,
the better the...drag queen.
- I'm really freakin' annoyed
with all the big girls
that have been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
A big girl can't make it past
the first or second episode.
- I'm 6'7" flat-footed,
7'2" in heels.
I wear size 17 shoe.
And I dance like I'm little.
[laughs]
- Initially,
when I first started drag,
I was always too big
or I was always a booger
or I was not feminine enough
or not this enough
or not that enough.
- My butt goes up and down
on the scale and everything.
But a girl doesn't have to pad.
- You know, I was always
the fat kid,
and drag just gave me confidence
to be ballsy, brash,
kind of like a Mae West.
- I make fun of myself.
I don't want to make fun
of other people.
Yeah, I'm a bigger guy.
I'm a bigger drag queen,
a bigger girl.
But I have a lot of fun.
- Unfortunately, those zaftig
queens didn't make the cut.
But here are two delicious dames
who did.
This next queen
will not be ignored.
Joining the competition,
it's my pleasure to introduce
Mimi Imfurst.
- Hey, everybody,
it's Mimi Imfurst,
the hardest-working bitch
in show business,
and I'm the fat bitch
you're looking for.
You need to put a fat bitch
on the show
who's gonna tell it
like it is.
You need to put a fat bitch
on the show like me,
who's gonna deliver,
'cause I'm sick and tired
of messy fat girls
misrepresenting the big girls.
Honey, I'm gonna come in.
I'm gonna squash
the competition.
I don't care
if you're skinny or fat.
I know how to win.
I'm gorgeous, I'm glamorous,
and I'm semi-retarded,
and that is the advantage
that I need to take over
and be America's next
drag superstar.
All my drag is big
and glamorous and super campy
and smart.
And most importantly, I'm a
fierce motherfucking lip-syncer.
This is my fabulous closet.
As you can see, there are wigs
and dresses.
Lots of ruffles and sequins
and feathers.
Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill to make this?
I didn't make this one,
but I have Asian slaves
in Thailand who did.
- What I love about doing drag
is that it's empowering,
is that it allows you to be
anything that you want to be,
that you can take
what you were born with from God
and transform it
into whatever you can dream.
- We'll see if Mimi has
what it takes to finish first.
Bow down for our next queen.
From Back Swamp, North Carolina,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Hello?
Oh, what's up, RuPaul?
It's me, Ron Jones.
Give me a second.
I'll be right out.
I'm gonna show you a little
glimpse into my life.
My drag persona
is Stacy Matthews.
She's vivacious.
She's large and in charge.
So being a big girl,
don't let anybody ever tell you
that you cannot do the things
that small girls can do,
because I've done it all.
I would say
my life as a drag queen
has been the most fabulous thing
I've ever experienced.
I've been doing drag now
for about nine years.
Being a plus-sized queen,
it's not always easy
to have the confidence
that you need,
especially living where I live.
I am from the deep South.
This is my closet.
I want to show you a few things
that I've been working on.
Here are some of my shoes
that I do wear.
We've got this...flower gown.
You see that fringe, girl?
- Being in the Bible Belt,
people around here
look down on people like us,
because they don't
understand it.
So I do not feel upset or angry
at those people.
It's my job as a queen to
show them that we're people too
and we deserve respect.
- This country queen is busting
out of Back Swamp
and coming for the crown.
Let's hear from some of
the other hopefuls
to find out what inspired them
to do drag.
It's a little package
I like to call
"everything you wanted to know
about being a ladyboy
but were afraid to ask."
- This is my calling, and this
is what I'm supposed to do.
- I could have never anticipated
all the people
that I would meet
or the places that I would
travel to.
- In my charity work,
I've raised almost $200,000.
- Doing drag, to me, means
escaping the everyday life.
- Drag enables me to be
a supersonic version
of who I am on the inside.
- I don't want to be a woman.
I just want to dress up
and have fun.
- Drag, for me, gives me that
courage and that fearlessness.
- You can wrap people
around your little finger,
and they can't say a word.
- For me, drag is like therapy.
And so I don't have to pay
a therapist.
- Drag, for me, was an art form
that I can actually hide
all of my feelings behind,
from all the name callings
or just the word "faggot"
in general.
- I am not a gay man.
I'm a straight man
that performs in drag
for entertainment.
- When I was 19, my mother
kicked me out of the house.
By doing drag, I was able to
eat, to dress myself,
to go out shopping.
- I have two younger sisters.
They saw me perform
for the first time,
one of the best things that's
happened to me when performing,
because I really love
performing.
- I've done everything.
I've worked in Lower Manhattan,
the financial district,
for six months.
I've sold sunglasses
at the mall.
I've even been a contestant
on<i> Showtime at the Apollo.</i>
But nothing comes close
to the satisfaction that I get
from doing drag.
- A drag queen
is a true artist,
and her body is the canvas.
As many queens showed
in their audition tapes,
their face painting is nothing
short of a masterpiece.
Eat your heart out,
Michelangelo.
Raa!
- I put some Elmer's glue stick
over my eyebrows.
And I'm just gonna give you
a very pretty fishy lady face.
Aren't I gorgeous?
Don't you want to do me?
[kisses]
- First of all, it takes me
a good shower.
You must wash that ass
before you get in drag.
- I always do my makeup.
Normally, I take a good hour,
like, on my face.
And I'll put on
a really cute outfit.
When I walk into the bar,
I'm ready to perform.
- Now I'd like to show you
what it takes to become Versace.
So undergarments are an
extremely important accessory
for a drag queen.
I like to take in my waist
even further
with a cincher like this one.
And this is not my real ass,
but I did pay for it.
- This is what it takes to
transform into Jackie
along with a--with a nice big
roll of duct tape,
and we're all good.
And some couch cushion.
'cause you know
I'm a white girl,
so I got to put the curve in it.
- Can I get a "amen" up in here?
- Speaking of stunning
transformations,
the next two queens
competing this season
are masters of illusion.
First this high-energy queen
could give the Energizer bunny
a run for her money.
From the isle of Puerto Rico,
Miss Yara Sofia.
- I'm Gaby, a.k.a. Yara Sofia.
I'm from Puerto Rico.
I was born and raised here
in this beautiful island.
My character's name come
from a girl that I have
in high school.
She had beautiful legs.
So everybody told me
that I have beautiful legs,
and that's why I'm Yara Sofia.
When I look in the mirror,
I wasn't boy.
I was a girl,
'cause I love being a girl.
Now we're gonna talk fashion.
I have too many looks.
This one is a remake
from Alexander McQueen.
I could never forget the shoes.
What Yara Sofia loves to wear,
the animal print,
'cause I love animals.
I'm a fierce bitch.
- I want to compete
in this fabulous race,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
So here I am.
This is the time.
The third time is the time,
'cause after Jessica Wild,
the Puerto Rican girl
will win this race,
this competition.
It's for us.
So be prepared and watch me.
- Will Yara's edgy style
get her to the finish line?
<i>Escandalo.</i>
This next queen impressed me
with her professionalism,
not to mention she put the "hot"
in Hotlanta.
It's my pleasure to introduce
Phoenix.
- Hi, my name is Brian Trapp,
also known as Phoenix.
Hi,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Phoenix here
in Atlanta, Georgia.
I started drag, like,
ten years ago.
I kind of started doing these
little, like, amateur contests
and started winning.
And I kind of just got pushed
into the scene, and here I am.
The biggest hardship
is the boys.
The boys are crazy with it.
Like this year alone, I've had
this happen several times.
I'll have a guy, like,
all into me as Brian,
and then they figure out
what I do,
and it just completely changes.
It, like--
and it drives me insane.
I just look at me doing drag
as more of another way
for me to be creative
and be an artist.
I don't really consider myself
just a normal drag queen.
I look at myself as more like
an entertainer.
- I've pretty much been
a full-time entertainer,
and now I work six days a week.
I have one day off a week.
But I'm ready to do
something different,
and I really think,
from what I've seen
with<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
it gives you a larger scale
to work with.
Bye.
- Rising from the ashes,
Phoenix is ready
to burn it down.
Now, that's my kind of queen.
For the very first time,
we held open auditions
on Hollywood Boulevard.
[people cheering]
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> judge Santino Rice</i>
joined me,
and we got to meet
some very colorful characters.
- Let me get in on your shot,
girl.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Let me in there!
- Security?
- My name is Delta Work.
I'm from Norwalk, California.
And I'm here to try out
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
I'm so excited.
I put my tape together
the day before the deadline.
I rushed it.
I was ready to go.
The waiting's over, and I'm
ready to take it to the top.
- You ain't gonna do nothing.
- You shady cow.
- My name is Venus D-Lite.
I'm 26 years old.
I'm from Los Angeles,
California.
I think what sets me apart
from all the other drag queens
is that I'm unique,
I'm professional,
and I like to get
the shit done.
- Hello, world.
It's me.
It's Terlene.
I'm America's next
drag superstar,
'cause I have the fucking gall,
the talent, the nerve.
- I'm America's next drag
superstar,
because I am a superstar.
- I'll cut some bitches
if I have to.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
- I'm not worried at all
about the competition.
Bring it on.
I've dealt with a lot
of shady queens.
I'm ready, RuPaul.
- Where would you put this
if you were me?
- Tell us
about your drag persona.
- My name
is Miss Mona Lot-Moore.
- I'm Miss Barbie Q.
- I'm Allusia.
- Mercedes Electra,
the Hollywood icon.
- I bet you are.
- My name is Detox.
I'm pretty much, like, a mix
between<i> Jem and the Holograms</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
on crack
and Patrick Nagel.
- Oh, well,
that's all you need.
- Whoo!
All right!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Bring it on, baby!
Bring it home to mama.
- I feel like a fake
Barbie right now, to be honest,
the way I'm talking.
Do I sound like a Barbie to you?
"Yes, hello.
How are you?"
- [chuckles]
- I'm Christina Boss.
I'm 16.
Okay, I'm 27.
Shh.
- Vickie Bouffant.
I'm 37.
And, bitch, I am from Chicago!
Originally.
- Hi, I'm Wendy Watch
from Wetumka, Oklahoma,
and I'm 42 years old.
- Mona can go from gowns
and, like, glamour
to solicitation
on the streets.
[record scratch]
- Are you Lady Deuce?
- Yes, I am.
- How'd you get the name
Lady Deuce?
- One of my really, really best
friends,
her name is Lady Deuce.
Kind of, like, a tribute to her.
- You have a best friend
whose name is Lady Deuce?
- Yes.
- And you decided, "I think
I want to use that name too."
Did you try Claire Voyant?
What about Sarah Tonen?
- No.
- Tara Misu?
- Tiramisu?
- Yeah.
- Isn't that, like, a soup
or something?
[cymbal crash]
- Hi, good morning.
- Hello.
How gorgeous you are.
- Thank you.
My name is Delta.
I'm 34 years old.
And I'm from the city of
Norwalk.
I've been doing drag
for over ten years.
- Do they tip
in southern California?
- On a good night, yeah.
I hate showing up to,
like, Ross,
and paying all ones, but...
- Do you cross-dress for less?
- I cross-dress for more,
'cause I got more to cover.
- Okay.
- A lot of the "big girls"
that do shows,
it's always a comedy.
I do comedic things.
I do things that are serious.
Hopefully, overall, the thing
that runs through it all
is just entertainment.
- Awesome.
What unique skills do you have?
- I can stick my tongue
behind my uvula.
- I've been tap-dancing
for the last ten ye--
last ten--
[gasps] 20 years.
- I can sing live.
I've been classically trained.
- Hmm, well, my physical talent
right now is a little tucked.
- I can, uh, make a dinner
for 40 on $1.95.
- Oh!
Oh! Ah!
Ah!
Mm.
- [laughs]
- I can get spots
out of anything.
- I can do this.
[crickets chirping]
- Jiminy Christmas.
- Yeah.
Ah.
Well, hello there.
What as surpris--look at that.
- Oh, do you live?
- Oh, Mary McFadden,
eat your heart out.
- Oh, yes.
- I love it.
- Now, this is just day wear,
okay?
You got to see my evening wear,
okay?
- You're Venus D-Lite?
- I'm Venus D-Lite.
- Now, you look like
a country queen.
- It's a little Cyndi Lauper
too.
- Just a little bit.
I'm giving, like, Cyndi Lauper,
Judy Jetson.
- Who do you pattern yourself
after?
- Madonna, Grace Jones,
Barbra Streisand.
Madonna just shocked people,
and that's me as a performer.
- How long have you been
performing?
- Almost ten years, and I'm 26.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Wow.
- Jailbait queen. Brilliant.
- Thank you.
- I tell you what.
Let's take a look
at your lip-sync prowess.
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Can I turn around?
- Yes, ma'am.
- [clears throat]
- Is this new?
- Yeah, it's new.
- [laughs]
It's the new new.
- Is this KISS FM?
- I know you're watching.
Oh, my goodness!
Don't hurt nobody, now.
Oh, okay.
Yes.
- Gorgeous.
- [laughs]
Thank you guys so much.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Allusia.
And we'll see.
- All right.
Mwah. Bye.
- Well, thank you so much,
Reya.
- Thank you.
- Thank you,
and I will sleep with anybody
if it helps me get the part.
Just putting that out there.
- Thank you.
- Well, Mercedes Electra,
thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- And that boa is amazing.
Wow.
- It's like the embodiment
of being gay.
- Now, would you wear a boa
like that?
Well, I got to tell you,
you know,
I'm so impressed with you.
I think that you are--you're
what we're looking for.
And, Venus, you're coming
to<i> Drag Race.</i>
- [squeals]
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
- [laughs]
- Thank you.
- Don't fuck it up.
- This is the best thing that's
ever happened to my life.
I'm so excited.
This is just--oh, my god.
I finally won my Academy Award.
Oh!
[squeals]
- You know,
you are so unspookable.
- Am I?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Well, condragulations, Delta.
You're in.
- Really?
So in the running, like there's
one more step, or...
- No, you're in, girl.
- [screams]
Oh, my god!
I just got on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
season three!
I'm excited.
I'm ready.
Let's do it.
Start the race.
Shoot the gun.
- All right, darling.
- Buh-bye. Thank you.
- Bye. Awesome.
All right, Santino, I think we
got some really gorgeous gals.
- The world is going to gag.
- The world will be gagging.
Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.
- Every drag queen knows
that there's one thing
that can never be too tight:
her lip-sync.
Because one day, her very life
may depend upon it.
- Some of those lip-syncers
were pretty tight.
But, unfortunately, none of them
made the final cut.
My advice to those girls is to
keep working on your game,
because persistence pays off,
as proven by this next queen,
who applied not once, not twice,
but three times
before being invited to compete.
Please meet a girl who won't
take no for an answer,
Alexis Mateo.
- Hi, everybody.
My name is Alexis Mateo
from St. Pete, Florida.
I'm 30 years old.
I always bring something
to the table
completely different
and completely fresh.
And I'm original
from Puerto Rico,
and I come from a broken family.
I grew up
always trying to be accepted
and always trying to be
part of something.
When I was 12 years old,
I realized that all my dreams
were set in the performing life.
This is Alexis Mateo,
the little character
that I create inside my room
after that fabulous first
drag show that I saw.
It's the only thing
that I have of my own,
that nobody can steal from me.
When I'm with other drag queens,
I do have a very strong
point of view that I defend
and that I make myself be heard
and be respected.
Let me see.
What else can I show you?
This, I started
with a long dress,
and I just kind of cut it.
I use Mardi Gras beads sewn.
It's completely turned
into a giant ball gown.
I love the 3D effect
of the flowers.
- Alexis Mateo means to me
everything.
I love Alexis Mateo
because of that,
and, of course,
I love Alexis Mateo
'cause he can disguise
as everybody
and just be himself.
- This pageant queen
has her eyes on the prize.
And last but not least,
this breathtaking beauty
is from Atlanta,
and we call this queen Mariah.
- I am Mariah, and I reside now
locally in Atlanta, Georgia.
Mariah, she's an eclectic
bundle of inspiration
from everybody.
My style,
especially professionally,
is pretty much
just to go in there,
do what you have to do
without a whole bunch
of unnecessary extra.
Well, I don't perform
professionally.
That's not, like,
my form of income.
I don't do it for a living.
I actually compete
in the ballroom circuit.
And so it's pretty much kind of
a sudden-death version
of a pageant.
You have about 30 to 45 seconds
to prove yourself.
I'm bringing my "A" game,
so y'all girls better have your
lashes, your wigs,
and your fish grease,
because this one's
gonna be good.
Okay, so I'm officially out of
the closet,
ponytails and all.
This is the magic room.
This is, like,
all my human hair wigs.
This is where I keep them,
'cause they're so delicate.
They're so easy to tangle.
If you don't condition
and shampoo them
like you would your real hair,
oh, guess what.
This is where I keep
all my drag,
my feathers and hair
and shoes and things.
Actually made these myself.
I can't wait to serve y'all
little girls.
- Life is a drag,
and it's fabulous.
I mean, I'm really actually
couldn't see myself
doing anything else.
It's been an ongoing process
of meeting new people,
learning new things.
To me, my whole life--
it's an adventure.
Just enjoy it.
Don't take anything serious.
Except for your hair.
- Mariah is bringing ballroom
heat and serving realness.
So there you have it,
the 12 top queens competing
this season
for the title of America's next
drag superstar,
the best of the best.
Manila Luzon.
Carmen Carrera.
Venus D-Lite.
Delta Work.
Raja.
India Farrah.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Mimi Imfurst.
Phoenix.
Yara Sofia.
Alexis Mateo.
And Mariah.
Now, as fun as their audition
tapes were to watch,
let me tell you,
you ain't seen nothing yet.
These gentlemen are about to
start their engines.
And spoiler alert:
the best woman wins.
So buckle up for safety,
and I'll see you
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Condragulations, ladies.
You are the top three.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Alexis Mateo.
- Stretch and lift.
Are you guys at home getting it?
Sickening, no?
- Cha-cha-cha!
- Cha-cha!
- Yes. Big ol' titties
and lots of ass.
- Look at those hips.
- The drama.
- Papi, I want you to come
back home, baby.
Bam!
- Hello!
- Manila Luzon.
That ensemb-la from the house of
of Imelda.
- Mabuhay, mabuhay.
What's next?
- Oh!
- Is that a bomb?
For the love of money!
- What you buzzin' about?
- Oh, yes! Okay!
- [chattering]
- That is what a lip sync for
your life is all about.
- Yes! Work!
- Raja.
No stranger to the runway.
- No one can hear you
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die!
- Navajo.
- And tonight...
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
The final countdown...
America's next drag superstar
In this season's stunning
conclusion.
Is...
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup;
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
May the best woman win.
[tires screech]
- Nice.
- What! Top three, byotches!
- Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' 'bout.
- We're back into the workroom
today, and Yara Sofia is gone.
- Oh, my god, it's like
a paragraph.
[Manila laughs]
Oh, and there's a flag!
- Yara is my sister, and it's
kind of sad to see her leave.
But it just gonna make me work
harder to reach my goal.
I came here to be America's next
drag superstar.
The top three.
Did you all imagine
that I was gonna be here?
I didn't know
I was ready to be here.
I mean, I always wanted to.
- Yeah.
- But, oh, my gosh, it got
so difficult.
- It got so difficult!
This is so much more difficult
than I ever imagined.
- This has given me
a completely newfound respect
for Alexis.
I've teased about her and called
her a booger, but she's here.
She's part of the top three.
She's worked
just as hard as I have.
I love looking at all these
empty spaces in the room.
Like, I just remember
all the voices and personalities
that were here with us.
- When I first saw Raja, I was
like, "What the fuck?"
Remember you walked in
with that one eye?
[laughter]
I said, "What is this?<i> </i>
<i>The Muppet Show?"</i>
And then Manila was
the other one.
Oh, my gosh, Manila, in the
beginning, you were so annoying.
- I didn't realize how annoying
you were until midway,
and I was like...
[laughter]
- Okay, y'all think
I'm annoying.
Now, imagine what it's like
for me to live my life.
Trust me; I know I'm annoying.
Actually, Raja, I'm really happy
that I got to meet you,
because you've been doing it
for so long,
and it's nice to know that,
like, you can still do it
when you're in your late 40s.
- The library is closed!
[siren]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who's the queeniest of them all?
Who's got the style?
Who's got the grace?
Who's got the balls
to take my place?
Now, if more is more,
then bigger is badder.
And when it comes to your
dreams,
size really do matter.
Mm-hmm.
- What does that mean?
- I think whoever has the
biggest dick, honey.
- I won!
- Yay!
- [laughs]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh!
all: Oh!
- It's me, your favorite judge!
I'm here to deliver
your final challenge.
Ru's often said
that this competition is like
the Olympics of drag.
And now this is your chance to
go for the gold.
This week, you become
Greek goddesses.
all: Oh!
- Living statuary.
- Oh, beautiful.
- Prepare for the clash
of the Xanadu Titans
as you costar in the music video
for RuPaul's single<i> Champion.</i>
[whooping, laughing]
- That's awesome!
- Yeah!
- The brilliant Mathu Andersen
will be your director,
and the super-talented
Ryan Heffington
will teach you
to dance like goddesses.
- Yay!
- And...
to keep up your strength,
you'll each have
a one-on-one luncheon
with Miss RuPaul herself.
- [whooping]
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[all cheer]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi!
- When I first saw Ryan,
I said...
- Today we're gonna work on some
choreography
for RuPaul's new song,<i> Champion.</i>
So let's really try to take it
out on this contemporary mode.
It's about being
a statuesque goddess.
Raja, can I have you take
this box here?
- I'm a little nervous,
because I am a runway girl,
and I don't know about dancing.
That's not my thing.
- You are statues,
but you are gonna morph
into different positions, okay?
So I want to see you guys
hit poses
every four counts.
One, two, three, four,
and then morph.
One, two, three, four.
Hold one, two, three, four.
Pose, one, two, three, four.
Okay?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight.
And hah, two, three, four.
And switch, six, seven, eight.
Hold one, two, three, four.
- Whoo!
I'm gonna fall off the box.
- Raja, let's try to be more...
hieroglyphic,
beautiful statues, yes?
Again, five, six, seven, eight.
And switch.
- Oh.
- Manila, make it a little bit
more grand.
You are a statue.
They've carved you out of stone.
This is not gonna get it.
Now cross over.
Go!
Bah bah bah bah bah.
Bah bah ah-bah bah bah.
And through.
And through.
And through.
And off camera, yes.
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Alexis, her poses are amazing.
She knows how to portray
the character I'm asking for,
and it's instant with her.
The other two girls are really
gonna have to pull up
to match her.
- Hi, Ru.
- Darling!
Have a seat.
- Walking towards Ru
to have my lunch with him
is nerve-wracking.
It's a moment that could define
the whole competition.
- I've taken the liberty
to fix you a plate.
- I'm on a diet.
- Just have half of one.
- [laughing]
- Who is rooting for you
back home?
- Well, my family's rooting
for me.
[tearfully] I am so blessed.
When I walk in my house,
I can be myself with my mom,
with my sister...
with my friends.
And it's completely strange
that people
that I met in United States
that, like,
they always keep me going.
- So they're an extended family
that you've created in America.
I'm sure that they're<i> very</i><span style="bodyStyle"> proud</i>
of you.
Now that there are three,
what is your strategy?
- Well, I just gonna be myself.
And I am very sure
that I am perfect,
so it doesn't matter
what happens in the competition.
I know I'm a star.
- You already are a star.
Well, we had lunch,
and you didn't touch a thing.
- [laughs]
I told you I was in a diet.
I want to work on my body
so Michelle likes it.
- [laughs]
All right, darling.
You just keep on flying.
- Thank you for lunch.
The bill's on you.
- [laughs]
- Bye, Ru.
- Hi.
- Now it's time for us to
rehearse the part of the routine
where we get to use a pit crew
member as a prop.
- It should look like you've
known each other forever.
Actually, no.
You've known each other
for two nights.
It's always a little bit more
heated after...that point.
Yes. Mm.
Now peeking over
the shoulder.
And in that moment...
ah, we missed that moment.
Come back.
Yes, now get intimate and
closer.
Ah, and down, down, down, down,
down, down, up.
- Ta-da! No?
- Do you have a fear of
intimacy?
- Little bit.
I'm having the hardest time
focusing.
And I understand
where it's coming from.
He is probably seeing me
holding back,
because I fucked up a lot
in my life.
I want to win this contest.
And I really do not want
to fuck this up.
- It's about the intimacy
between you two,
and I think if
it's a little bit more true,
it'll read true on camera.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Raja really needs to let
her guard down.
I think that's what she's gonna
have to break through
in order to make this part
of the video work.
- Well, hello there!
Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.
- What's been the hardest part
for you?
- Being away from my family,
not being able to call.
Hopefully,
they'll be proud of me,
because this is my medium.
- You're saying hopefully
they'll be proud of you.
Is there a chance that they
won't be proud of you?
- You know, it's a part of me
that my father really doesn't
like to be a part of.
Ever since I was a little boy,
he tried playing catch with me,
and he said, "Oh, well, this is
not gonna work."
- [laughs]
What do you think it would take
for your father to come around?
- Part of it is me.
I feel like my dad's probably
willing to learn
and be part of my lifestyle
as a drag queen.
I came here hoping that I would
be successful at it,
and then I could come back
and be like,
"Dad, Dad, look what I did."
He'd be so proud of me, even if
it's not, like, the ideal thing
that he would want me to do.
- I want you to say to him
what you're feeling,
what you would want him to take
from your being on this show.
- Daddy...
um, I couldn't have been here
without you and Mom.
It feels nice to be blessed,
to have, um...
like, a supportive family,
'cause I know lots of people
don't.
- And you're one of
the lucky ones.
It would be great for your
father to be proud of you,
but the truth is, it's about you
being proud of yourself.
- Well, hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Welcome.
- Now it's time to rehearse
the part of the video
when I gonna be joined
by the pit crew guy.
- So we are now gonna work
on the more intimate side
of the video.
- Can we take the clothes off?
- Whatever helps.
- Let's go.
- And rotating in...and...
Beautiful, yes, yes, yes.
Gorgeous. So from here...
I want you guys to improv.
- Oh, Jesus.
- But I don't want you to
separate.
A little closer.
Don't lean away.
Get into it.
Uh-huh. And...
[Alexis giggling]
No laughing.
Stay connected...
and work there for a moment,
improv.
[both laughing]
No laughing!
- It was very nerve-wracking
to have somebody
that you don't know
work with you as so close,
because it's a very intimate
moment.
- It's a simple...
- Touchy-touchy.
- Touchy.
You know, maybe it's here.
Click.
Shabam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
Alexis has dance background.
However, when it comes
to turning off
that stage persona,
I think it's really hard
for Alexis to do that.
Hopefully, she can just be
a little bit more in the moment.
Even though I'm giving you
choreography,
it should not look like
choreography.
It should look like you guys
are in your bedroom,
on your satin sheets,
working it out.
- Hi, Ru.
- Well, hello, Raja.
- What is this, Thanksgiving?
- [laughs]
- I couldn't possibly.
- You're a bit of an introvert.
- Sometimes, yeah.
- When you're on the runway,
you own the room.
How does an introvert live
in the body of an extravert?
- [laughs]
- How does that work?
- Duality comes from me being
a Gemini, I think.
There's a whole other side of me
that's a complete ham and
exhibitionist,
and I really love
being in front of people.
- Who's rooting for you
at home?
- I'm really hoping
that my parents
are going to pay attention
and really see what I do,
maybe for the first time
in their lives.
- Wow.
- You know, they've been
in some of the great moments
in my life,
but never have they seen
how proud I am to do what I do.
This will be a really great way
for them to see how much life
it brings to me.
- Is there anything you want
to tell them?
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Look at me;
I'm sitting with RuPaul!
[laughing]
That's a drag queen,
and so am I.
[both laughing]
- Look, darling,
lunch was fabulous.
Break a leg out there.
- I will.
- All right.
- All right, see you later.
- Thanks, doll.
- Bye, Ru.
- And arms come in
around to his chest.
Yeah. Beautiful.
And...uh, okay, cool.
- Oh, oh, oh, watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
I'm a married woman.
It's kind of awkward.
I have to get all, like, nasty
and grind up on some, like, sexy
greased-up man.
- Look at each other.
- You're so greasy!
What's my boyfriend gonna think?
Sorry, baby.
- Oh, my god,
it's a music video.
I never imagine myself
in one of RuPaul's video.
- I've imagined it before.
I just didn't think
it would actually happen.
We're about to shoot
Ru's video,
and I'm a little scared.
I have put in a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears
into this competition.
Now's the time to put on
the real show.
- Oh! Blond Asian, y'all!
Get used to it.
- It's the final challenge,
and it is bigger than ever,
because this is
some serious shit.
This is the real deal.
The jig is up.
- Wow!
Here comes the bride.
We walk onto set, and there's
Ru, a vision in white.
- She looks like a goddess.
It almost looks like a dream.
- Okay, smoke up!
Action!
- Faces!
- Extend those lines!
Go!
- And go!
Go, Alexis, go!
Go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Cut!
Yeah, uh, so try not to leave
too early.
Let the girls pass the end.
You'll be the last one to leave.
So just work the center there.
Don't leave too early.
- Oh, bitch,
I was just called out.
RuPaul's standing right there,
and I'm screwing it all up.
- You'll be the last one,
so just turn, keep posing.
They cross. They cross.
You cross.
- Okay, they cross.
They cross. You cross.
- Yes.
- The first take was a mess.
We don't want Ru thinking, like,
"Oh, these three queens
are gonna fuck
my whole music video up."
We don't want that.
- Long neck, Alexis.
Give face, give bone.
- And...
- More robust!
- Quickly, here we go!
- Oh!
- Cut!
Thank you.
- I almost fell.
- We are not hitting
what we need to hit.
It has become a circus.
- This is our last thing
with Ru, understand?
So get it right.
- Nip slip, aisle four.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Keep that energy up, ladies.
Here we go.
- Action.
- Go!
- And arms, arms, arms!
Hold!
And exit.
Nice.
Much better!
- Much better, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Moving on?
- Yes, moving on.
- I love how I'm wearing, like,
a bikini
on top of, like, a onesie.
- Fierce.
- The Greek goddesses part of
the video is over,
so now we're gonna be athletes
since we have new, black, sexy,
skimpy-ass costumes.
- Raja, let me use your glue
for a second.
- Alexis is wearing huge hair.
Probably not the smartest thing
to do.
I mean, you're trying to be
fierce athletes.
- Whoo!
Olympi-who?
Yes, mama.
Let's do this.
And action.
- A-one, two, three, four.
A-five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four.
We have to hit our marks,
ladies.
- Manila, you were off.
- I'm sorry.
- If you're off,
you're just gonna get hidden
behind Alexis's hair.
- It's really hard
to see your mark
that's, like, a little tiny dot
on this big, white stage.
And Alexis's hair is, like,
totally, like, in my way.
- Action!
- A-five, six, seven, eight.
And one!
- Oh, sorry.
- Cut. Try it again.
- Manila fucked it up.
- Sorry, guys. I'm sorry.
- When you hit it, you can do
that, but don't...
because someone's hair is
very large,
and it blocks other people.
But I'm not saying who.
- They trying to blame my hair
because of Manila's mistakes.
Bitch, don't hide behind me.
You got your mark.
The bigger the hair,
the closer to God.
- And one, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
And up and up
and up!
That was the best shot, yes.
- Now we're going to introduce
boys to the mix.
- Manila, let's hit it.
Five, six, take your time.
Seven, eight.
Moving through it.
And ah.
Let this be a moment here.
Ah.
Lift that leg.
[Latin guitar music]
- I'm a ballerina.
I am 93 pounds.
- Take it slow.
Ecstasy.
Come up slowly...
and improv here for a second.
- Oh!
- Oh.
[both laugh]
- Okay, that was beautiful.
- Awesome.
- Let's move along
to our next victim.
- Raja, you're up.
- Yay! I get to touch
naked man body.
- Here we go. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- And...
- Yes, mama.
- Beautiful.
- I feel, um, unfaithful.
[giggles]
- And...it kind of looked like
a head job.
- Before you start going down
his body at the end,
hold it for a second.
- Okay.
[laughs]
Sorry about it. Okay.
[sensual music]
- Yes!
- Now, this is the moment
right here.
We want to see it.
- Beautiful, you guys.
Keep moving.
[both gag]
- She's done that before.
- And...
- Bam.
- Yes, take me!
- All right, high kick.
- I'm tingling!
- Nice!
- I had to just really let go
and realize that you know what?
Raja, you are known for being
a sensual performer.
It was all about me doing
what I do
and doing it well.
- Hello, Alexis Mateo.
- Let's hit it, from the top.
- And...action.
[light rhythm]
Sensuous.
Beautiful.
- Okay. You flip me?
- Alexis, you're going to have
to focus on your profile,
because when you turn front,
you have no--you're just...
both: Hair.
- [whispers] Such big hair.
- All right.
- And...action.
- And go, Jason.
[light rhythm]
Profile.
- Beautiful.
That's beautiful.
Gorgeous, Alexis.
- Maybe some more arms.
- I like it.
It's like a live sex show.
- And...
yes, cha-cha around each other.
And go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- Bam, baby!
- [laughing]
Bam!
- Okay, ladies, 25 minutes to
shoot the whole video.
- Grab your prop.
So, Miss Javelin,
you'll go first.
- Sure.
- Do it hard and fast.
- Keep the tip up.
Go.
- Beautiful. Great.
That looked good.
Bow and arrow, Alexis.
Make me believe that you're
a huntress.
And go!
Okay.
- Manila, you're up.
- Ooh!
[laughs]
- Action.
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Action.
That was nice.
Okay, and serving...discus.
Action on spinning
and...play back.
- I think my earliest drag live
growing up
was being in talent show,
the little boy pageants.
Now I am in RuPaul's video<i> </i>
<i>Champion.</i>
I'm a champion.
- Coming to this competition,
I knew that I was going to be
put through the wringers.
It's exhausting.
But the highs and lows, like,
all just kind of blended
into one fun ride,
and it's great.
I feel alive.
- I have told myself in the past
that I couldn't do anything
right
or I wasn't good enough.
Right now, it's just about me
showing off.
I am fearless, and I am beyond
proud of myself.
[song ends]
- [gasps]
The last day ever!
- The last day!
- Oh, my god.
- We're back in the workroom,
and it's the very, very last
day,
and someone is gonna get a crown
tonight.
I'm so excited.
- I don't mean to be corny, but
let's just do a quick group hug.
Can we?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, I love you guys!
- All drama aside,
it's just the three of us,
and went through
this whole thing together.
And it's very comforting to know
that two other people know this
experience as well as I do.
- Sisters forever.
- Okay, stop humping!
Oh, god!
- Alexis, what is that?
- I don't even care how I did
or how it comes out.
I'm in RuPaul's video,
motherfucker.
- Hey!
- Lick it. Lick it.
- You better work it out, miss.
- [laughs]
- Do you guys think
that you've changed,
like, being in this
competition?
- I think my performance style
definitely changed.
I feel like I've gone
to college, you know,
and I'm graduating or something.
- You know, honestly, like,
I feel like I've changed a lot,
because I never did drag
as, like--
you know, full-time, really.
So it's really cool
to actually experience
doing it, like, hard-core.
- I haven't changed.
I still the same, bitch.
My drag haven't changed at all,
'cause where I come from,
it just one way to the drag,
and that's read it in a book.
- Raja.
- What?
- Why do you think you should
win this competition?
- Because I'm fiercer
than you guys.
- [scoffs]
- Well, you got us there.
- [laughs]
- If I don't win,
I would love to see you
get crowned, Manila.
- Oh!
- Really soon, America will know
who will be
America's next drag superstar.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
[applause]
Well, hello, there.
Welcome to the main stage of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tonight it's just family,
so let's get nuclear.
Michelle Visage!
- RuPaul!
- [laughing]
My muse.
Can you believe
it's almost over?
- I cannot.
Very sad but very happy night.
- Yes, bittersweet.
- Indeed.
- Santino Rice.
- Ru!
- Are you ready to crown
a winner?
- I'm ready.
We've got three amazing queens.
And I can't wait to see what
they bring to the stage tonight.
- Yes.
For the grand finale,
we challenged our girls
to become Greek goddesses for
my newest video,<i> Champion.</i>
Tonight they've put together
outfits
that will take your breath away.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
For the grand finale,
welcome Raja.
- All that jazz
and then some.
- Oh,<i> Cabaret.</i>
- Willkommen, bienvenue.
- I'm walking down the runway
for the last time,
and I'm just
in this moment right now.
I'm not really thinking
of the competition.
I'm just gonna rock it.
- Nothing beats a great pair
of legs.
- Bob Fosse.
- Yeah.
- Life is a cabaret!
Up next, Manila.
She done brought her own crown.
- [laughing]
- I'm walking down the runway,
and I'm just in my gown.
I've got sparkly jewelry
all over the place,
and I feel like a winner.
- Look at that train.
Work all of that train, mama.
- Chartreuse charmeuse.
- Mm, gentlemen prefer Manila.
Alexis Mateo.
Sunday in the park with Alexis.
- Yes, she can-can.
- I pick my showgirl costume,
because it's the last time
that the judges is gonna see me,
and I wanted to remind them
that this is who I am.
Alexis Mateo
is all about the show,
is all about the glamour,
and the stage is mine.
- And she vajazzled her head.
- She brings her own shade to
the runway.
- Yes, she does.
- Yes, she does.
- Meet me in St. Louis.
Wow.
My top three girls.
Each of you won three
challenges,
which is pretty amazing.
Are you ready for the judges'
final critiques?
Let's go.
So, Raja, let's take a look
at highlights
from your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[RuPaul's<i> Champion]</i>
[applause]
- I love your take on drag.
I love your Victor/Victoria
look.
You are a star.
But I would say I'm not
feeling you as a blond.
But it did look Grecian.
- Love this look on you
tonight.
And I love androgyny, especially
when it comes to beauty.
You really know how to work
a camera for a beauty shot.
But you would have been stronger
if you had more makeup.
- Manila Luzon.
Let's take a look at highlights
of your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[applause]
- You got to do your scene
with Jason.
I could smell the chemistry.
- It was hard,
because I'm thinking, like,
"My boyfriend's
gonna kill me.
My boyfriend's gonna kill me."
- Well,
as an international star,
Sahara will just have to
learn to accept that.
- You've saved this,
and you just brought it
to us tonight in a big way.
I think it would look better
with smaller earrings.
But it's a lot of fun to see you
come out here.
And I love, you know, when
you're just, like, giving it.
If you could bottle that
for a beauty queen,
you would be a billionaire.
I think you looked stunning
in the video.
Some of the choreography was
a little bit awkward.
- Manila Luzon, from week one to
the top three,
you've been consistent,
never too old to be a princess.
And you are such a pretty,
pretty princess tonight.
The video,
I loved that little lift.
I've told you before I'm not
a fan of you as a blonde.
Your face was still gorgeous,
but you kind of lose you
when you do the blonde.
I love the streak.
That's about as blonde
as you should ever go.
- Alexis Mateo.
- Hola.
- Top three.
- Bitches, we did it!
[laughter]
- Tell me about your outfit.
- Today I wanted to show
who I am for real,
and, like, I'm a showgirl.
- I want to take a look at the
highlights from your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[laughter, applause]
- Yes!
- So how do you feel?
- I feel like when you want to
roll your "r" so bad, like...
rrrrr!
[laughter]
- I really thought you brought
the overall kind of athleticism
and almost Olympic quality to
this piece.
- I'm gonna be completely
honest with you.
You were one I did not expect to
see in the final three.
Every time I counted you out,
you brought it and shut me up.
All I can say
about the video is,
you stayed true to who you are.
Even in the Grecian times,
you were doing some cha-cha.
There was not a minute
in this whole competition
that you ever let down
your sweetness
and your vulnerability
and your honesty.
You're just adorable.
- Oh, Michelle said something
good about me, bitches.
[laughter]
I have to cha-cha for that,
'cause I'm so happy.
- Tonight before the judges and
I deliberate for the final time,
we'd like to hear
from each of you alone.
Alexis, you're first.
I want you to give me
a pro and a con
for each of your competitors.
- Raja's pro is the runway walk,
like nobody else
in this competition.
Something that I don't like
about Raja:
he's so hard to read.
Manila was the only girl
in the competition
who I really want to punch
in the face.
I was like, "Manila, I think
you're annoying," and she said,
"You know what?
I think so too."
And we actually got one thing
in common!
[laughter]
- I want your pros and cons.
- Every time I make a decision
to move forward in life,
I am my own enemy.
If I wish I could have changed
something about my life,
it would be how hard I am
when I judge myself.
But I am a fighter.
And I don't regret anything,
because it have make me
so strong
that I actually can say
I am my biggest hero.
- Alexis Mateo was one of
the first queens
that, like, really
stuck out in my mind.
I think she's an amazing
performer.
As for cons,
the drag that she does,
I've seen it before,
and it doesn't excite me.
I love Raja.
She's very fashion,
but sometimes
it's, like, a little bit
too, like, editorial.
Those are my cons first.
Get those out of the way
so I can end on a high note.
I'm kind of crazy
and a little unpredictable,
and I'm kind of stubborn
at times.
But I feel like I've proven
I can do almost anything.
So...I can be me for myself and
please other people.
- Alexis is a very, very
talented performer.
Cons: I don't really think
she thinks outside of the box.
Her marabou and her rhinestones
feels a little bit stagnant
to me.
It's always an entertaining
moment with Manila,
and I think that's awesome.
But Manila has a lot of growth
to do.
There's still a bit of
a template that she fits into.
I'm not really into templates.
- I want to ask you
about your pros and cons.
- For the first time in my life,
I can say
that I'm a beautiful person.
[tearfully]
It's taken a long time,
and it's been
a treacherous journey,
but I'm in this moment
right now,
and it feels so fucking great,
and I'm proud of it.
I'm very proud.
- Thank you, Raja.
While you and the other girls
enjoy an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
Just between us girls, Manila.
She's amazing.
She can do everything.
- She is a knockout.
Her personality is fantastic.
If you're looking for somebody
to represent you
and<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
she's got
a wonderful stage presence
and can actually speak.
- I wanted to feel...
some sincerity.
She always stops herself
on an emotional level.
- I just happen to think
Manila is a superstar.
- And Manila has won
the last two challenges.
- She did.
- She's on a roll.
So let's move on to Alexis.
- You know how many times
I've counted her out?
- Tell me, how many times have
you counted her out?
- At least three or four times.
And then bam!
- Her Florida style of drag has
been considered, by many people,
to be too regional to be
America's next drag superstar.
- I never counted her out.
She is so authentic in what
she's bringing to the table
that I give her a free pass
on the over-the-top cha-cha.
- Her conviction is flawless.
Yeah, it's just flawless.
Let's move on to Raja.
- Sometimes I feel like she's
only worried
about the runway aspect
of the challenge.
- The bitch is bad.
- But does she do anything else
besides high fashion?
- Well, she won
three challenges.
- Yeah, she did.
- And she doesn't take herself
too seriously.
The bucket of blood,
remember that?
- Yeah, the<i> Carrie</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing?</i>
- She takes genderfuck
and turns it into something
that's actually heightened and
intellectual and special.
- Her take on drag is very
different, very fresh and new.
- This is not going to be easy.
- All three of them are
superstars,
and they're all
equally as fierce.
- Silence!
This ain't over until they
lip-synch for their lives.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
It all comes down to this.
Based on your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> music video</i>
and your heroic work
throughout this competition,
I've made some decisions.
- [exhales]
This is it.
- Alexis Mateo...
your smile and spirit
remind us all
of the joy that drag brings
to the world.
It breaks my heart
to say this...
but you are not America's next
drag superstar.
Thank you, Alexis.
- [whispers] Thank you.
- Now...sashay away.
- Thank you.
[applause]
It doesn't matter
if I didn't won.
Knowing the things
that I have done in my life
to get to this point,
it feels wonderful.
The sky is the limit for me,
and this is just the beginning
for something wonderful.
The jig is up, bitches.
- Two beautiful queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me
and walk away with the title of
America's next drag superstar.
- My heart has never beat
faster in my life.
I felt like it was gonna jump
out of my chest.
- The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life!
- I'm so excited.
It might be me that's the next
drag superstar.
So let's get this lip sync on.
- Good luck,
and for the last time,
don't fuck it up.
- I'm lip-synching the song
the way that I lip sync.
I'm lip-synching this as Manila.
- All eyes are on me,
and it's about me
really, really hitting it
and doing it Raja-style.
[song ends]
[applause]
- Wowza.
- Ho ho!
- Oh, I love you.
- Oh, my god!
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
America's next drag superstar,
is...
Raja.
[majestic music]
- Congratulations.
You were so good.
- Manila, you are
an inspiration.
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.
- Now...sashay away.
- I can't even explain
being so close
and then just not being able
to get there.
I don't think I could have done
anything differently.
I wouldn't have changed
this experience for anything.
I wouldn't have traded it
for anything.
And I'm happy how far I made it.
I'm first runner-up,
so if Raja dies of old age,
then maybe I'll get the crown.
- Raja, my queen...
I bow to thee.
- [laughs]
Along with this title,
I can use it now
to talk to kids who have no clue
that you could be a star.
I just want to let them know
that it's all right to be
a social misfit.
It's okay to think outside of
the box
and think greater than
what you know.
- Now, prance, I say.
Prance, my queen.
- All hail the queen!
[RuPaul's<i> Superstar]</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Bravo!
- Work, mama.
- Work it, baby!
- Yes!
- Grand prize contributed
in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.
- The crown is mine,
the cash is mine,
and I am America's next
drag superstar.
- And now the world premiere
of RuPaul's<i> Champion.</i>


- Oh, but, baby, you know how
I feel.
I mean, you really want me to
say it?
[laughing] This is silly.
Okay, here goes.
[imitating Cher]
Wagon wheel watusi!
[laughs]
You so crazy.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, Chaz.
I got that song,<i> Superstar.</i>
You know, the one you wanted to
rehearse for the show tonight.
- Oh, Chaz, I been so busy
selling the air rights to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I</i>
completely forgot it.
- Cool.
I-I can come in tomorrow.
- Well, no, no.
Let's just get it over with.
Okay, you want a spot?
- [imitating Cher]
Snap out of it!
What do you think, Chaz?
<i>Tonight, it's the superstar</i>
<i>edition of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Oh oh!
<i>- Get ready to gag, as we flash</i>
<i>back on this season's most</i>
<i>unforgettable moments.</i>
<i>Watch as this year's</i>
<i>queens bare</i>
<i>more than just their latex</i>
<i>boobies in never-before-seen,</i>
<i>up-close, and personal moments.</i>
<i>Join our extra-special guests,</i>
<i>Jujubee, Raven, and queen Tyra</i>
<i>as we count down the top ten</i>
<i>most sickening fits and</i>
<i>fashions.</i>
<i>Plus, outrageous outtakes</i>
<i>of our celebrity judges.</i>
- It's gonna be a bitch fight!
- [giggles]
<i>- With just one week until we</i>
<i>crown our new queen.</i>
<i>We salute our final three.</i>
<i>Alexis Mateo, Raja,</i>
<i>and Manila Luzon.</i>
Welcome to the superstar edition
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> chock</i>
<i>full of never-before-seen</i>
<i>footage for added freshness.</i>
<i>This season, none of our</i>
<i>showgirls threw marbles on the</i>
<i>runway, but they did have a few</i>
<i>catty things to say about each</i>
<i>other.</i>
Let's take a look.
- What did you think about
Shangela's Tina?
- Shangela's Tina was okay.
You know.
- Are you serious?
She looked like Tina Turner
after Ike beat her down.
- Was that my name?
- Yeah, we're talking about
Tina Turner, girl.
- This hair is not soundproof.
- When people are talking about
you, that means you're doing
something right.
What's more American than
Marilyn Monroe?
- Oh, my gosh, you don't look
anything like Marilyn Monroe.
You probably look like Marilyn
Manson.
[laughter]
- But not Marilyn Monroe.
- If, but--I'm not in drag, I'm
so quiet.
- You say you're quiet?
You're not quiet, bitch.
- You're not quiet.
- Who would you say is the
funniest person here?
- Like, who cracks me up the
most?
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.
I crack myself up all the time.
- No one ever gets your jokes
except for you.
- First of all, she look like a
fat ass, cheap Barbie doll from
the dollar store.
- [laughing] Damn.
- If you have nothing nice to
say, don't say anything at all.
But if you nothing nice to say,
come sit next to me.
- I like your shoes.
They're cute.
- [deep voice]
Thanks, Heather.
You guys have the most
a-softest voices for men.
- Well, that's because you sound
like James Earl Jones, honey.
- Oh, fuck off,
sprepper bitch.
- What do you think of Alexis'?
- Wow.
That's just gonna make her look
really thick in the middle.
- That is so ugly.
- I don't want to look like I've
been eating the cake.
- Raja, girl, listen, I'm gonna
give you a little bit of advice.
Don't ever walk into an antique
store.
They just might keep you, girl.
[laughter]
- I mean, even her skin is
rejecting the makeup.
It's like, some people are just
not meant to do it,
and if your skin is rejecting
the makeup...
- Your body is telling you
something.
- Your face looks so much
better; so much better.
- Uck, I know, 'cause before I
was painted like Carmen Carrera.
- No, before, bitch, you was
painted like a motherfucking
ghost, honey.
- Okay, the library's closed!
- Me-ow!
Speaking of mean girls, the
self-proclaimed popular queens,
led by Raja and Manila, formed
a secret clique called
the Heathers.
- She was fetch.
- Heather!
Stop trying to make "fetch"
work; it's not happening.
- They pitted themselves
against the rest of the girls,
who they lovingly referred to as
the boogers.
["valley girl" voice] Oh, my
god, don't you, like, totally
miss high school?
- Heather.
- Heather wants to talk to us.
- Come hither, Heather.
- Heather, what are you making?
- Carmen, Manila, Delta, and
myself have decided to call each
other Heather because we formed
this clique which looks a lot
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>
- There's just Heathers and
boogers.
- Does anyone know why the
other girls are calling each
other Heather?
- I don't know.
- It's just retarded.
These dumb bitches.
- I love calling you Heather.
It's so much fun.
- How's your outfit going,
Heather?
- It's going gorgeous.
- So, Yara, are you still
friends with Shangela?
- Yes.
- We can make you a Heather,
but you can't talk to the other
boogaronis.
- No, I don't want to.
- I'm just kidding.
- Everybody's just playing a
game.
But I think they're going
overboard.
No, I would have never worked
with the Heathers.
- If anyone looks at us as being
a clique, it's just
because they're insecure.
- I don't know what they put in
the breakfast.
- Boogers.
- Relax.
- I'm so over them.
- We got this.
We're the Heathers.
- Thank you.
- Here at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
we don't just entertain.
We "edjumacate."
And this season, our queens
taught us more new words than
Sarah Palin, although she may
refudiate that.
The first<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> word is...</i>
"busted."
- Everybody should have the
right to do drag, even if they
look busted.
- When it's not polished and
it's not there, it's just like,
bitch, it looks busted, and you
need to fix it.
- And you have to not be busted
like miss Raja over here.
- Crusted and busted.
- Busted people, they don't
know they're busted.
- Busted, party of one.
- [laughs]
- These other girls are busted.
- If you want to know the
truth, you need just one letter.
T.
- Ugh, I have so much T for you.
- What is the T?
- Here's the T.
- Just give me the T.
- There's the T.
- What's the T?
- She knows the T.
- You spilled your T to your
mom?
- How do you say, "that's the
T in Spanish?"
- [speaks Spanish]
- What?
- Oh, that is not the T.
- Some queens invented
their own catchphrases.
- Hallelu, ladies!
Hallelu!
He said hallelu.
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu.
- Hallelu.
- Is that a read?
- Hallelu, lelu.
- To quote Alexis Mateo, it
should say...
- Bam!
- Bam.
- Bam!
- Love the bam in all that
stuff.
- Bam!
- It was bam.
- Ah, thank you.
-<i> Echa, echa, echa pa'lante!</i>
- Help me say it.
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
- Darling, I have one thing to
say to you.
- And there were certain
expressions that seemed to get
stuck in all our heads.
Be a lady.
- Be a lady.
- Be a lady.
- "Don't be shady, be a lady."
- That bitch dances the house
down.
- He is going to ream me the
house down.
The house down is a drawn-out
version
of the exclamation point.
She is fierce, the house down.
- She is painted the house down.
- I'm padding the house down.
- I'm a diva, because a diva
delivers.
- Oh, so now you're delivering.
- Cannot walk.
- Oh, so, now you injured.
- It's really just the shoes.
- So now you're a drag queen?
- I can walk on water.
- Oh, so now you Jesus?
- [laughs]
- And then there's every drag
queen's favorite.
The f-word.
- Ooh, girl, you look fierce.
- I am fat, I am fierce.
- The reason you're here is
because you are fierce.
- It's like, "bitch, you look
fierce."
- Your Joan Crawford was not
Mildred fierce.
- You know there are some fierce
bitches here.
- She's one fierce mothertucker.
- But I think I did a fierce job
today.
- We're not here to be shady,
just fierce.
And what do you call something
that's fiercer than fierce?
You call it sickening.
- I am what? Sickening.
- Sickening.
- It was sickening to break him
in, honey.
- And by sickening, she means
sending people to the hospital.
- That's when it's, like,
sickening, girl.
- My thing is glamour and being
sickening.
- Thank you.
- One day, Alexis Mateo, I will
be as sickening as you.
- Sickening, no?
- Hi, and welcome back to the
superstar edition of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, here to help me count down
the most sickening fits and
fashions, I've invited three
legendary children.
Yes, legendary.
Welcome back the tasty Jujubee.
The mistress Raven.
And America's reigning drag
superstar, miss Tyra Sanchez.
Well, hello, my queens.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, mama.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you for having us.
- [laughs]
- Now, ladies...
let's count down the most
sickening fits and fashions on
the runway.
Coming in at number ten,
Manila Luzon
and her fluffy Christmas muff.
- Ooh.
- Look at the size of that muff.
I think she looks like this
exotic Russian model.
She looks absolutely
breathtaking.
- Manila Luzon, you have a muff
to die for.
- I think she looks fabulous.
I mean, I want that outfit for
myself.
It might be the only muff I put
my hands in.
It's cute.
- Coming at number nine
is Yara Sofia's
twisted follicle fantasy.
- I loved it.
The purse is my favorite.
It was, like, very hot.
- Yeah, she puts it together.
- This thing, though, I don't
know how that stayed on her
head.
- I think she looked like
a couture poodle.
Giving you hair body.
Ruff.
[laughter]
- All right, girls, coming in
at number eight, the ambush of
Shangela.
Who do you think should go home
tonight?
- I would like to see Shangela
go.
She's just a loudmouth, and
she's always talking, and
halleluing.
- Shangela, although your
personality shines, I think you
should be on season five or six.
That's where you should be.
- You know, you three have all
been in the workroom with
Shangela before.
- Yes.
- Is she annoying, Jujubee?
- I don't think she's annoying
at all.
She cracked me up.
- Yeah?
- I was mad when she left.
I wanted to see more of her.
So I think it was great that
she's back.
- Do you think that was fair
what Manila and Raja said to
Shangela?
- Well, I think everyone's
entitled to their own opinion,
but it just reminded me of the
wedding episode.
So I felt like how Shangela
felt.
They're entitled to say what
they want to say.
I think they could have said it
in a more polite way.
- In your case or in Shangela's
case?
- In both cases.
- [laughs]
- I'm sorry.
- In our number seven spot,
it's our cheerleading jocks in
frocks.
They've got spirit, yes they do.
They've got spirit.
How 'bout you?
- Whoo!
- Baby!
- Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
- No bareback! No bareback!
- Abstinence is for boogers,
but we love our diaphragm!
- Protection is the key!
Safe sex!
- These are some ladies.
- Well, one of 'em looked like
Juju.
- Okay, she was giving you body.
- Yeah.
- She was giving shoulders,
girl.
- Whatever.
- Raja was my favorite.
It reminded me so much
of<i> White Chicks</i>
when they started dancing.
It was just hilarious.
- I love Yara Sofia trying to
spell out the word "wrap," and
every letter, it sounds like
she's gonna say a different
letter.
- Give me the A!
- A!
- Give me the ah-a!
- A!
- Their performance was one of
the funniest things I've seen on
national television in a long,
long time.
- Safe sex, motherfuckers!
- Wrap that dick!
- Coming in at number six is
Raja from the lost tribe of
supermodels.
- Fabulous fierce.
I wish I had her body, for real.
There needs to be a time when
you can go, "okay, I'm gonna
rough it up and make this a
little edgy."
I wanna see that bitch do
<i>Avatar.</i>
-<i> Dragatar.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes.
- At number five, Alexis
Mateo's eye-popping,
jaw-dropping outfit from
the drag queens of comedy.
- I'm a Latina girl, and I only
have two options in this
country.
And you all know I didn't came
here to clean toilets, baby, so
I became a stripper, baby!
- I love big titties.
[laughter]
- Actually, last season,
I think you were the only queen
who had a breast plate.
- Mm-hmm.
- This season, several of the
girls were pumping breast
plates.
Is that a trend that's happening
around the world right now?
- Um, I've noticed that,
wherever I go now, there are
a lot of queens with it now.
It comes to the point where,
like, I don't even wear it as
much anymore because--
- Are you pumping the breast
plate now?
- No. No.
- Just natural.
- Just natural.
- [laughs]
Making the number four spot
on our countdown is the gift
that keeps on giving...
Carmen Carrera's ass.
- I think clothing repels off of
her.
You know?
I'm like, "girl, did you get
that half off?"
- My dick would be really mad
as--
I don't know where she put it.
- Pissed off.
- She's got some skills.
- Yeah.
- In your group, Raven, were
there any girls who were naked
like that?
- I think the only one that
came close to that was Mystique.
- Yeah.
I'm kidding.
[laughter]
- Coming in at number three is
Shangela, serving some
post-modern pimp realness.
- Well, you know I had a dumbass
girlfriend.
She came screaming at me last
week, talkin' about, "Laquifa!"
I said, "what?!"
"Where your hoes at?"
I said, "bitch, don't you see
I'm wearin' four pair of hose
right here
holding back my dick!"
- That bitch is hilarious.
I can watch that over and over
again.
- It was very well thought out.
Everything that she did.
The way she puts her hand on
her, "I'm also my own ho."
I absolutely loved it.
- Coming in at number two on
the most sickening fits and
fashions involves miss India
Ferrah getting a bit carried
away.
- If that were me, if that was
me carried away...
Mimi would have been
drop-kicked.
- Uh-oh.
- I would have got kung fu on
her.
- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.
It crosses a line, and it shows
your desperation.
- First and foremost,
be a lady.
- Keep it cute.
- Keep it cute.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now, what would you have done
in that situation?
- Well, it's $75,000 that
you're giving away, and you
don't want to go home.
You want to be there and you
want to win.
So, in her mind, she's thinking,
"I can't go home.
I cannot go home."
- But I will say India handled
it very well.
When she was finally put down,
she did her thing.
I will say props to India.
And I love India's mug.
- And now, the moment we've all
been waiting for, the coveted
number one spot on our
countdown.
The most sickening of them all
goes to...
Who could it be?
Isn't anybody gonna interrupt
me?
- Hold on, now, Ru.
The top spot belongs to...
- Ahggh...
- You!
- Me?! What?
What are you talking about?
Are you telling me that I'm
number one three years in a row?
- Three years in a row.
- Is that a record?
Susan Lucci, eat your heart out.
- My favorite was
your Barbie look.
You came out and you were like,
"okay."
- Valley girl.
- Oh, yes.
- Where I was going as a black
woman for the first time in my
life.
I was portraying a black woman.
- You nailed it.
- Do you think so?
- Did a really good job.
- Oh, good, thank you.
Thank you.
Raven, what was your favorite
look?
- The one where you're in the
black and yellow dress.
- That's the glamazon with the
Mohawk story going.
- Yes.
- It was gorgeous.
- And, Tyra, what about me?
What about RuPaul?
What I want to know is what
dress would you want to mock?
- It's like a peach color.
- Yeah, it's got the dandelion
big--
- All over, I think I'd want to
mock that one.
- Very ra-cha-cha.
[laughter]
Well, thank you, ladies.
I know you'll be watching next
week to find out who gets
crowned America's next drag
superstar.
Thank you for chiming in.
Lots of luck.
Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, to reach the final three,
Alexis, Manila, and Raja had to
really pump up the volume.
Because the ten queens who left
before them did not go quietly.
- Hello.
all: Hi!
<i>- Now, we barely got to</i>
<i>know Venus D-Lite.</i>
<i>A fierce Madonna</i>
<i>impersonator...</i>
<i>Venus found her holiday was cut</i>
<i>short, and quicker than a ray</i>
<i>of light, she was gone.</i>
The next queen to fly the coop
was Phoenix.
After an awkward first
impression, her psychic ability
made her team captain.
- Action!
- You've arrived in a
hermaphrodite spaceship.
Prepare to trannyport in three,
two, one.
- Phoenix, you're delivering
all your lines away from the
camera.
We need to see your gorgeous
face.
- Okay.
- I think you could have been a
little zanier, especially with a
name like Lady Tata.
<i>- But even Phoenix couldn't</i>
<i>predict that her performance as</i>
<i>Lady Tata would make her the</i>
<i>second queen to leave the race.</i>
Mimi Imfurst...
- Welcome to my party!
I brought cookies.
<i>- Got off to a rocky start.</i>
<i>Her confidence was shaken when</i>
<i>she tried to put the "merry"</i>
back in Christmas.
- [crying] I don't know what I
was thinking.
And if I have to lip-synch,
I'll
motherfucking lip-synch my life
off.
<i>- But her lively personality</i>
<i>soon came busting out all over.</i>
Much to the annoyance of some of
the other girls.
- Action.
- Aah!
- Miss Mimi, there's a
difference in being talented...
and being a showboat.
<i>- Her performance from</i>
Queens from Uranus<i> received</i>
<i>some stellar reviews.</i>
But her workout video proved to
be more pain than gain.
- You gotta get higher!
Chase after your man!
You're gonna grab him!
- Oh!
- Hold him up!
- Cut! It's just feeling a
little disorganized.
- It was hokey.
It was not good.
<i>- And her lip-synch with India</i>
<i>Ferrah got way too physical.</i>
- Get her off of me!
<i>- And Mimi Imfurst was the</i>
<i>third queen to go home.</i>
India Ferrah arrived from Ohio
with an all-star reputation.
- Girl...prison, honey.
I look over to Phoenix copying
my style, so I actually had to
go up to her and be a little
cunt to her.
I love your hair.
<i>- India's rubber boobies became</i>
<i>stars in their own right.</i>
- I thought they were just
completely believable.
- But the judges wanted to see
more than just jiggle.
- Give me more face.
- Okay.
- Give me more of that.
- There is a hell no storm.
Okay?
<i>- Her performance as the QNN</i>
<i>weather girl was met with an</i>
<i>arctic blast, and India was the</i>
<i>fourth to sashay away.</i>
This next lady boy served fish
like she was working at Red
Lobster, and we call this queen
Mariah.
- Prepare to gag on my eleganza.
<i>- One of the most flawless</i>
<i>beauties to ever grace the</i>
<i>runaway.</i>
<i>Mariah's poise and</i>
<i>self-confidence seemed like it</i>
<i>would carry her far.</i>
- When we find out that we have
to go out during the daytime and
go shopping in drag, I'm good,
'cause, baby, if it's right,
it's right.
<i>- And in the snatch game, her</i>
<i>impression of Joan Crawford did</i>
not earn her the respect she
felt entitled to.
- Now, that is not a wire
hanger.
- It's not.
- What is it?
- It's a wooden hanger.
[all groan]
<i>- And that led to the</i>
<i>emancipation of Mariah.</i>
It's safe to say that Stacy
Layne Matthews has put
Back Swamp, North Carolina, on
the map.
Her clone does not sleep alone.
- You look so much
like my relatives.
Is she related and I don't know
it?
- The back swamp Jacksons.
- Shake it! Ohh!
- Excellent.
- Yes! Mmm!
<i>- But Stacy's personality,</i>
<i>humor,</i>
<i>and star quality soon emerged.</i>
- Okay.
- Monique?
- Precious!
- Uh-oh.
Is Precious back there?
- Mm-hmm.
Bitch knows I'm hungry as hell.
- Eventually, the pressure of
competition started to get to
Stacy.
<i>And even her red velvet cake</i>
<i>ensemble wasn't sweet enough to</i>
<i>keep her in the competition.</i>
Delta work arrived here as one
of the girls to beat.
- Delta, you better...
- And I'm Delta Work.
Pour yourself another cup of
ambition
because this is the Morning
After News.
- Looking sexy.
- So do you. I love you in pink.
- Thanks.
- And, darling, we're done.
- Oh! Cool!
- [laughs]
- We won't be able to get you
to put clothes on anymore.
- No, I don't think so.
Carmen Carrera better watch out.
- [laughs]
<i>Her ability to make us laugh</i>
kept her in the competition week
after week.
- One, two, three. Like that!
You see how that feels?
Do it like that!
You've got enough, you can stick
it right down inside there.
And you can jump up and down.
<i>- But in the end, it was her</i>
<i>stand-up comedy routine</i>
<i>that got</i>
<i>her eliminated.</i>
Jersey princess Carmen Carrera
flaunted a figure
that wouldn't quit.
- Hey, hey.
- Carmen Carrera is like the
flyest girl you're ever gonna
meet in your life.
- She's an ass-tronaut.
- I make sure that her body is
flawless.
If you find the flaw, let me
know.
- Hey.
No foam here.
- 100% made in the USA.
- Ohh!
<i>- Her reggae version of</i>
Superstar
<i>didn't make the sun splash</i>
<i>she wanted it to.</i>
<i>- But in a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> first,</i>
the judges later overruled
my decision.
- I can't.
I don't wanna look.
Ohh!
[cheers and jeers]
- I'm back, bitches.
both: Uh-oh, she said
my pussy's turning red.
- Ooh!
both: No burn, limpy.
Protection is the key!
<i>- Unable to turn her jock into</i>
<i>a convincing drag sister,</i>
<i>Carmen</i>
<i>was sent home...again.</i>
<i>This time for good.</i>
This season started with a big
surprise.
- Hallelu, ladies!
[cheers and applause]
- What the fuck?
- Ohh!
- But it turns out the surprise
was on Shangela when her snowman
couture put her in the bottom
two in the first week.
both: Stop flirting!
You stop flirting!
Ohh!
<i>- She rocketed back, winning</i>
<i>the next challenge with her</i>
<i>twin bot, Alexis Mateo.</i>
[imitating Cher] Shangela.
It's the drive I saw in Shangela
that kept her fighting when her
back was up against the wall.
- I said, "bitch, better have
my money!"
You pick up the hallelula hoop
and you put it back around your
waist!
And you work the hallehula hoop.
One, two, three, four.
I don't want that whore no more.
Five, six, seven, eight.
I am gonna find a date.
<i>- But even her irrepressible</i>
<i>hallelu spirit couldn't carry</i>
<i>Shangela into the final three.</i>
Yara Sofia arrived from
Puerto Rico as a dark horse
in this competition.
- Oh oh!
Oh, almost burned my ass.
Oh, my god.
Cha! Cha!
<i>Echa pa'lante!</i>
<i>- But her sense of humor and</i>
<i>her</i>
<i>joy for life proved to be</i>
<i>contagious in challenge...</i>
- Ohh!
<i>- After challenge.</i>
- Hyuh! [raspberry]
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
Get out, get out, get out!
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.
[laughter]
- Can I have some whater?
[laughter]
How'd it sound?
- By George, I think you've got
it!
- Ohh, rheally?
- Yes!
<i>But, forced to lip-synch for</i>
<i>her life against her good</i>
<i>friend</i>
<i>Alexis Mateo, Yara seemed to</i>
<i>throw in the towel too early.</i>
<i>- I'm so angry, and I'm so</i>
<i>disappointed.</i>
<i>I'm a mess.</i>
<i>- Sadly, we had to say adios.</i>
I'm so proud of each of these
incredible queens.
They made this competition the
stiffest one yet and really
forced our final three to earn
their place at the top.
Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>This year, the judge's panel</i>
<i>was star-studded.</i>
- [laughs]
- But you didn't get to see
half of what goes on behind that
table until now.
Like when my best girlfriend
Michelle Visage and I start
kicking, things can get real
stupid.
- Seeing India tonight on the
runway was like walking into the
mall,
and Claire's exploded all over
her.
- Well, I want to see you do me;
how would you do me?
[laughs]
Michelle, sashay away.
- Ohh.
- You know, my personal mantra
is, it's not a party until
someone gets a bucket of pig
blood dumped on her head.
- Oh, that's mine too.
Mm, it smells like freedom
in here.
- Ooh, I thought I washed.
- [laughs]
The boy judges had their manic
moments too between Santino,
Billy B., and Mike Ruiz--
child, nobody was safe.
- She always looks beautiful,
but she looks like a beautiful
special needs child.
[laughter]
- And we love special needs
children.
- Some of you who do have very
feminine features still contour
the crap out of it, and you look
like Lil Kim before she went to
the doctor.
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- I'm just saying.
- You need to get
a refrigerator,
because you're going sour.
- Am I wilting?
- There's some fruit flies
buzzing around your head.
- Now, Billy, is it possible
that you are pregnant right now
and you don't know it?
- My shoes are wet.
I think my water just broke.
[laughter]
- You did this funny thing with
your lips when you were doing
the runway, this puckering
thing.
It looks like you were--
suck the
paint off a Cadillac
with those lips.
- Your...pie looked delicious.
And not the one you were
holding, heh heh!
In a whole constellation of
asses,
she's got the brightest ass.
- Thank you very much, Albert
Einstein.
Santa Claus, please, keep it
quiet.
Thank you, Phil Donahue.
Now, my favorite part of the
show is watching our celebrity
guest judges, who are really
just big fans, get caught up in
the spirit of drag race.
And nobody goes home until
they've strutted their stuff on
the runway.
Don't be jealous of their
boogie.
- Not only can the judges walk
the walk,
they talk the talk too.
Here is some never-before-seen
footage to show you just what I
mean.
- I think it's extraordinary.
You look like Paris Hilton if
she was the Motel 6 heiress.
[laughter]
- I think Santa has Venus envy.
[laughter]
- It looks like ladies' night at
the Star Wars cantina.
Are you feeling intergalactic?
- Very intergalactic.
- That's so funny, because I'm
interga-lactating right now.
- Are you?
- Because that is the real T,
this girl, okay?
If you could put a pair of
trousers and a blazer and look
feminine, hon'ty, you deserve to
snatch several daytime Emmys,
okay?
- The walk, however.
It's like you do have a horse
between your legs.
- Apparently, he does.
- Your smile is absolutely
lovely.
- 15 years since I've been to
the dentist.
I just brush and floss.
- What?
- But you just take 'em out and
put 'em in a glass at night,
right?
- The biggest career move I ever
did was
to have my teeth removed.
- Exactly.
- Choking on chicken in an
exercise video is not good.
- It's not cute.
It's not cute for her.
- But choking on chicken in
private or choking your chicken.
- Choking anybody's chicken is
not cute
if it's on camera.
- I think your dress goes with
the whole India theme.
Sari.
- Sorry seems to be the
hardest...dress to wear.
- Yeah.
It is, it is.
- Smizing got out of control.
The smizing was--it's like gonna
be the next version of<i> Saw.</i>
Like,<i> Saw 10: The Smize.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Smize 5.
- Oh, I'm gettin' daggers!
I'm gonna cut you and she's
gonna cut me.
It's gonna be a bitch fight!
- You know, there's something
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> that</i>
frees up our judges to let it
all hang out.
Maybe a little too far out.
- If you haven't noticed, I'm
like a bald-headed ho.
I don't have any hair at all.
- That's the cake I would've
wanted
when I was like eight and having
my princess birthday party,
so I guess when I was eight, I
wanted a gay wedding cake.
Which makes sense.
- I want that shrug so bad.
- This one?
- I want to roll around in it.
I want to see it first thing in
the morning.
I want to nuzzle it.
- The thing that I didn't like
was, like, I felt like she had a
bouquet of flowers in her hair.
- What's wrong with flowers in
her hair?
- And it was really distracting.
- Will you look at Ru?
- Yeah, I've got a bouquet of
flowers here.
- Ru's got a damn florist,
not a bouquet.
- I got a lot going on.
- You're more fresh than a
hibiscus bush.
- I got some birds.
I had some snakes.
- I'm gonna have an apple in a
minute.
[laughter]
- Did you bake that cake in your
lovin' oven?
- What? I'm sorry?
[laughter]
Never mind.
Judges, you have not been a help
at all.
- Sorry.
- Two-time guest judge, the
luminous La Toya Jackson, has a
giggle that is both magical and
infectious.
Before long, she had everybody
doing the toy-toy titter.
Hee hee hee hee!
- [giggling]
[laughter]
[giggling]
Am I wrong for saying that?
- How about that La Toya
Jackson?
- Hee hee hee hee hee!
- Are you recording this?
[giggling]
[all mocking La Toya's laugh]
- I'm drinking champagne!
Hee hee hee hee!
- [giggles]
Stop it.
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>Now, there's more to drag</i>
<i>queens than meets the eye.</i>
<i>Beneath all the padding,</i>
<i>glitter, and false eyelashes,</i>
lady boys need love too.
- I've had a boyfriend
for ten years.
- I want to be with my husband
for ten years.
It's been more than three years.
- The thing about a
relationship, and plus, you're
a drag queen; I mean, you gotta
just be ready for anything,
you know?
- Well, the thing is that he
gets a two-for-one with Carmen,
you know what I mean, so...
there's no complaints.
- Are you missing your husband
at all?
- Yes, I miss him, girl.
- Are you?
- And I know he's missing me.
Like, I guess that's the hardest
part of--that I know, like, what
he's going through.
You know, he loves me to death.
He would do anything for me.
He goes to all my shows.
Helps me, dresses me.
- Oh, how cool.
- It's so difficult for us in
this business to actually meet
somebody.
- Oh, yes.
- That's why you have to date
another drag queen.
- Yes!
- It's nice, because, like, you
understand each other.
And you double your wardrobe.
[laughter]
- When it comes to seeing their
son in high heels and a dress,
some parents just don't
understand.
But our brave and talented
queens have learned to carry on.
- Yara, has your family ever
come to see you perform?
- My mother, the thing she
doesn't get it is she thinks
that I'm a stripper.
- Well, you kind of are.
- She doesn't get that
we lip-sync and we do
[indistinct],
you know what I mean?
She doesn't get it.
- I think Yara's a stripper.
[laughs]
- Hey, Shangela, has your
grandmother ever seen you
perform?
- She loved it, she was like,
"I couldn't believe it.
You look like a woman.
I said, 'That's not DJ.
That's a white woman.'"
- Home is where the love is.
And some of our queens have
created new families, with drag
mothers and drag sisters that
make the world a more fabulous
place to live.
- You guys have houses.
- Mm-hmm, houses.
- What does that mean?
Like a family?
- It's kind of like
fraternities and sororities.
But with gay culture.
Most of our house names are
after designers.
- Okay.
- So it's like you have the
house of Balenciaga, the house
of Chanel, the house of...
so many others.
- What house are you in?
- Balenciaga.
- The Balenciaga.
- Balenciaga. Okay.
- I miss my drag family.
I mean, I see my family...
I call them my family 'cause
they really are my drag family.
But more than that, they're my
friends.
And I see them and talk to them
every day, all day long.
Even if we're not working.
- Exactly.
So really just family.
- Let's do this; let's do that.
- Before I did drag, I used to
go watch Raja's shows.
So she's like my unofficial
drag mother.
- Okay.
- Amen and hallelu.
Now, coming out is different for
everybody.
Some queens don't put it
together until later in life.
And others, well...they just
seem to be born that way.
- When I came out of the womb,
I came out.
So it was just a matter of my
parents having to learn
and deal with it, you know?
- I grew up in a very ignorant
place.
We got, like, one gay kid a
year.
- Were you that one gay kid in
your class?
- I was the one gay kid that
everyone probably suspected.
I can remember, like, in
kindergarten, I was in catholic
school...and I would just like
go up to boys and kiss them.
- Believe me, if we were in
kindergarten together, I would
let you kiss me.
- [laughs]
- So, miss Phoenix, girl, we
both are from Georgia.
Was it as unpleasant for you as
it was for me?
- I remember, like, in high
school, somebody getting pegged
in the head with a Coke can,
'cause he was gay.
- Girl, shut up.
- And...
- They, ooh, they were--
- Yeah, I was like, "absolutely
not."
I'm like, "whatever is going on
with me..."
- Is gonna be with me.
- It's gonna be with me.
I'm not telling another
motherfucker.
One of my best friends, he kind
of like helped me come out, and
he actually is the one that
helped me get started in drag,
so...
- Oh, word.
- Yeah, I mean, he, like, kind
of showed me there is, like,
another world out there.
- Thank god.
- I'd take my friends to lunch
and be like, "um, okay.
So I have something to tell you.
And, as you know, I've gone on
dates with girls, but also I
have gone on dates with guys."
And then I'd just pause and wait
for the reaction.
And every time, everyone went,
"oh, I knew."
And I was like, "oh."
- I didn't come out.
My mom caught me.
- What do you mean she caught
you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
Your mom caught you doing what?
- I called my neighbor, and I
was doing my thing, and then my
mom opened the door, heh.
And I was there...
- Alexis, what's your coming out
story?
- It was horrible.
- How?
- I decided to have an
experience with a man.
He used to pick me up at school.
I got really scared, 'cause
everybody started saying that I
was gay and all this bullshit.
So I cut off relationship
thingy,
and he wrote a letter to my mom.
- [gasps]
- I walk in my house, and my
mom was sitting at the table,
and she said to me, "put your
backpack in your room.
I need to talk to you."
The jig was up.
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
In just one week, one of these
queens--Manila Luzon, Raja, or
Alexis Mateo--will be crowned
America's next drag superstar
and walk away with a lifetime
supply
<i>of Kryolan professional</i>
<i>makeup...</i>
<i>headline logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and win a cash prize of 75,000.</i>
Let's take a look back at the
special blend of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
that make these three queens the
cream of the crop.
Manila Luzon had a unique
insight coming
into this competition.
- My drag persona Manila is my
personal muse, because I inspire
myself.
During the day as a boy, I'm a
graphic designer.
And my job does affect my drag
because it really helps me put
together a visual story that I
want to communicate to the
audience.
- Her comedic abilities made
the judges laugh in challenge
after challenge after challenge.
- Manila, you're all ears, girl.
[laughter]
- Manila proved that there's
more to her than just comedy.
She brought originality and
served up high glamour.
<i>- Drag, to me, is creatively</i>
<i>bringing together an entire</i>
<i>story and costumes and</i>
<i>character</i>
and putting them
into one living being.
That's the best part.
<i>- A world-class queen</i>
<i>with beauty, brains,</i>
<i>and a bright persona,</i>
Manila just might have what it
takes to be
America's next drag superstar.
Christmas came early for
Southern California native Raja,
winning both challenges her
first week here.
- Oh, no stranger to the runway.
<i>- I've always been a drag</i>
<i>queen.</i>
<i>To me, it's just like</i>
<i>breathing.</i>
<i>I've always loved fashion and I</i>
<i>do drag because I don't believe</i>
<i>that only women are allowed to</i>
<i>wear beautiful, fashionable</i>
<i>things.</i>
<i>- Her high fashion</i>
<i>sensibilities, unexpected</i>
<i>choices, and incredible makeup</i>
<i>artistry kept Raja at the top</i>
<i>of the class.</i>
<i>- I love iconic people</i>
<i>within fashion.</i>
<i>A little coo coo, a little</i>
<i>berserk, a little funny,</i>
<i>a little eccentric--that's my</i>
<i>style; that's my fashion</i>
reference that I look to.
I don't care to look like
a Kardashian.
<i>Raja is cultural.</i>
<i>She's smart.</i>
<i>She's adventurous.</i>
<i>She definitely thinks</i>
<i>outside of the box.</i>
And she's genderless.
She's raceless
and she's ageless.
- Raja isn't just fierce.
She proved that she's versatile,
intelligent,
and isn't afraid to act the
fool.
- No one can hear your
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die!
<i>- Raja is definitely at the top</i>
<i>of her game.</i>
<i>But will her many talents take</i>
<i>her to the top of the heap?</i>
Straight out of central Florida
comes Alexis Mateo.
Bam.
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Elizabeth
<i>y todos los demas.</i>
[laughter]
Bam! Bam!
- Cha-cha.
<i>- A Puerto Rican pageant queen</i>
<i>whose beauty and positive</i>
<i>attitude are captivating.</i>
<i>- I grew up doing pageants.</i>
And it's always about how
flawless
and how perfect you are.
So I guess, in the back of my
mind, I'm always trying to be
completely pageant-ready.
- Behind her big smile,
we learned a story of pain
and loss.
Do you know anybody
in the military?
- [sighs]
Three years ago, I met somebody
very special in my life.
We get our relationship very
secretly.
And, like, the best moments of
my life was with him.
And he got called to go to
service,
and I don't know nothing
about him
since like a year and a half.
So I really don't know
if he's okay.
- What would you say to him
right now?
- I want to say I'm sorry and
that I love him so much
and that I am very proud of him.
- Alexis Mateo, you turned
sadness into gladness
and made us proud.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything
you'd like to say?
- I know some things
happen in life.
It teaches you a lot of valuable
lessons.
And this one helped me to grow,
'cause I normally depend a lot
from people.
And I want to say thank you to
that special person that showed
me that I needed to love myself
first.
<i>The best part of being a drag</i>
<i>queen--have the chance to be</i>
a star and be the center of
attention for a second.
<i>When I'm Alexis Mateo,</i>
<i>I think I'm perfect.</i>
<i>In my eyes, Alexis Mateo is the</i>
most beautiful drag queen
in the world.
[cheers and applause]
Bam!
- Alexis proves the winning
power of perseverance.
And that is a quality of
a champion, honey.
So there you have it.
Are you team Manila?
Team Raja?
Or team Alexis?
All three are fierce
competitors.
But only one can be
the champion.
Tune in next week, when we crown
America's next drag superstar
on the grand finale of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
- Amen!
- Let the music play!
<i>Grand prize contributed</i>
<i>in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.</i>


<i>- Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...
- Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first.
And I don't even think
she's second.
[exclamations]
- Alexis and I, as the twinbots,
we delivered.
both: Dragonauts away.
<i>- All right, Miss Raja.</i>
<i>- India Ferrah.</i>
<i>Her clone does not sleep alone.</i>
<i>Mimi Imfurst.</i>
<i>- I think that I stand a good</i>
<i>chance of winning this one.</i>
- Oh, damn the rules.
Let's call it a tie.
Shangela, Alexis,
you've won this challenge.
- Ooh!
- Delta Work, Shante, you stay.
Phoenix, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
It's time to get
totally leotarded.
[exclamations]
<i>The dolls get physical.</i>
- Feel it.
- [laughs]
<i>And it ain't always pretty.</i>
- Whoo-whoo-whoo.
<i>- And extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>fitness guru Susan Powter</i>
<i>and Latoya Jackson.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Eh.
- Poor Phoenix.
- Delta, you got rid of her.
- Oh, she said boots.
Phoenix is gone, and it's a new
day, it's a new challenge,
and I feel totally reenergized.
Raja, get ready to write
your name on here later.
[laughter]
- We won, girl.
- I'm a little surprised that
Shangela and Alexis won.
I think that I sort of went
a little outside the box
and was a little more sci-fi.
I felt like I got really close
to winning
the first challenge too.
- Mimi really does think
that Mimi's first.
- I mean, it's hard.
It's like, you know, you don't
want to be second best.
You want to be best.
- Really, I just didn't wanna
hear her talk.
<i>[alarm blares]</i>
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>Girl, you've got she-mail.</i>
<i>Hello, drag stars.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
all: Hi.
<i>- If you wanna win this race,</i>
<i>you've gotta feel the burn.</i>
<i>So stretch, bend over,</i>
<i>and take it</i>
<i>like America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
<i>Let me hear your body talk.</i>
<i>And remember...</i>
- Ow!
<i>- No pain, no gain.</i>
<i>[laughing]</i>
- Oh, my god.
- Ooh, girl.
- Oh, my god.
- Let me hear your body talk.
- Girl, you don't wanna hear
what this one has to say.
[laughter]
- Well, we just lost, girl.
I just lost.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hey.
- Do you know what time it is?
It's time to get leotarded.
- Oh.
- In this bag is a drag queen's
best friend
and worst kept secret...
duct tape.
all: Oh.
- Now for today's
mini-challenge, you'll become
drag MacGyvers to customize
a sporty fashion leotard using
only these rolls of duct tape.
But first, you'll need
to split up into groups of two
and one group of three.
- Delta, Stacy.
- Immediately, Mimi decides it
needs to be
the three
plus-sized queens together.
- You three here? Okay.
- The last thing I wanna do is
be on a team with Mimi.
Like, that's the last thing that
I wanna do.
- Ready?
Steady...
Tape!
[shrieking]
- Whatever I 'm doing to you
in pink, you do to me in purple.
Carmen and I have a bunch
of neon colors.
And so our idea is to do, like,
a super '80s,
kinda '90s workout leotard.
Girl, my tuck.
- Whoo!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to touch
your dick.
- Don't worry.
- Alexis and I came up with the
concept of corsets, bustiers,
with a little bit of ruffle.
- Whoo, sister,
you got me together.
Hallelu.
Good thing I didn't need
those ribs.
Get up in there.
Ow, ow.
- This looks like a trash bag,
completely.
I mean, it really looks bad.
This is a disaster.
This looks horrible, and we're
completely mismanaging the time.
- Start over?
- Yeah.
- Get over here.
Come here, Stace.
- Sorry.
- We ought to tape these
into your ear.
- Your braid.
- Oh, my god!
I love it, I gotta wear it.
- One, two, three, go.
They're not gonna close.
The boots aren't gonna close.
- Oh, shit,
something just popped.
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
Wow.
Ooh-wee, y'all are leotarded.
Let's see how
my designing queens did.
Alexis and Mariah...
Category is duct tape.
- Alexis and I,
our outfits came out nice.
I feel good about what we did,
and I might even save it
for later.
- Let them have it.
Next up, Yara and Raja.
Letting them have it
in a<i> Flashdance</i><span style="bodyStyle"> effect.</i>
Carmen and Manila...
she's wearing
her duct tape iPod.
- We're giving fierce
jazzercise realness.
- Yes, ooh, la-la.
Shangela and India,
serving desert storm.
Yes, she's looking
for a few good men.
Last but not least,
Stacy, Delta, and Mimi...
The Supremes are back.
- There were parts
of the leotard
that didn't fit properly.
Everyone in the room
is looking at me,
and it's a really
uncomfortable feeling.
- Okay...
[laughing]
- That whole group
with Mimi, Delta, and Stacy
looked like two sisters
that had gotten pulled
into a girl group that they
didn't wanna be a part of.
- Okay, gym bunnies...
Now I've seen your leotarded
outfits, and...
The winning team is
Manila and Carmen.
- Ah! Wheeee!
- Condragulations, ladies.
Come on up.
Do you know what time it is now?
It's time
to get totally leotarded!
- Oh!
[applause]
- Now, a great drag queen knows
how important it is
to keep her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent in tip-top shape.
So for this week's main
challenge, you are going to
produce your very own
inspirational workout videos.
[applause]
Yes.
Now, Manila and Carmen,
you are the captains
for this team challenge.
Manila, you won the toss.
Who do you pick first?
- Raja.
Thank god I won the coin toss.
Gag.
I want Raja because Raja is
the only person I've seen here
that's actually done a sit-up.
- All right, Carmen,
who do you choose?
- Hmm, I want a big girl.
I want Delta.
- All right.
- My first pick is Delta
because I wanted to form
the prettiest group,
you know what I mean, so I
picked the prettiest big girl.
- Shangela.
- Mariah.
- Mimi.
- Ah!
- So I choose Yara.
- Alexis.
- Yes.
- I love Stacy,
but I already got my big girl.
So I 'm gonna choose India.
- I get Stacy.
- Yay.
- No shade, girl, no shade.
I've come to realize that if
this was gonna be
a workout challenge,
they were gonna leave
the big bitch behind, honey.
- Captain Manila...
Captain Carmen...
you're in charge of assigning
each queen an exercise
and creating a sporty team look.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
All right.
- What's the--what's the name
of our video?
- It has to be hysterical.
- Transform yourself.
From flab to fierce.
- Mm.
- I have this idea.
What if I painted myself to look
like I was 85,000 years old,
and I was like, it's,
"Do you like my big ball?"
[giggles]
- What?
- Mimi gets that whole Miminess
of it all,
and it's driving me up the wall.
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
- I'm gonna do the stepper.
- You said you wanted something
with your boobs?
- The boob shaker thingy.
- So she has the shake weight.
- Titty shaker girl.
- Is that funny?
- No, you should just call it
the shake n' bake weight,
and you just shake and bake,
do it from this side.
- That's right, that's right.
- You can do it from this side.
- There's times when I feel like
I'm not heard,
because a lot of people
in this competition
like to talk over you.
- I can do the jump rope; what
can you do with jump roping?
- Chuck-a-rope.
- [giggles]
- What about chuck-a-rope?
- Okay, yep.
- Our challenge today is to
create a workout video in teams.
- I want us to look like,
kinda like a rainbow.
Like Skittles.
You do blue, and you do green.
Do red. Do red.
I think I'm a good leader.
I think I'm a great leader.
I'm really good
at judging things.
- Something tastic,
since it's elastic.
- No.
- I listen to people.
- You can put one in here.
- No.
- Like, I could--I could this
one, like...
- No.
- Carmen is so bossy.
- Okay.
But what is that gonna be for?
I don't know if Delta's gonna be
able to do that.
- This is gonna be about
physical fitness,
and I'm completely terrified.
The fact is,
I sit before you 350 pounds.
And I would say not a week goes
by that I don't get a letter
from someone commenting on what
a pig I am, or how ugly I am.
Jesus Christ, I feel sick.
Thank you for picking me.
- Of course, you're my girl.
Delta really needs to work on
her self-confidence issues
because she's flawless.
I think she's sickening,
you know what I mean?
And...it's a shame.
- So we're doing busted, right?
- Don't look, like,
too crazy busted.
- And we're doing garage doors?
- Garage doors, girl.
One color on your eye.
- Where'd you hear garage doors?
- One of my friends from Texas
was, like,
making fun of some queens.
She was like, "that bitch came
out with blue garage doors
on her eyes."
- [chuckles]
I'm sitting here thinking
it's an industry term.
I was like, mm-hmm, yeah,
garage doors, girl.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi.
- How are my little endorphin
junkies doing?
Team Carmen, right?
all: Yes.
- Now I wanna hear all about
your workout video.
Now India, did you choose
your expertise?
- I was assigned.
I got the rubber tug.
- Oh, have you ever used one
before?
- No. I don't know nothing
about exercising.
I don't work out, I don't have a
gym membership.
And I 'm like, "oh, god,
this could be good or bad."
- What about you, Yara?
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>
- Oh, help me with that.
- It means move forward.
You wanna look like this, you
gotta work it out, darlin'.
So<i> echar pa'lante.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Work it out.
- [giggles]
All right, Delta?
- So I'm going
to shake and bake.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.
- Delta, can you come over and
show me what you've done there?
I'm already inspired.
- Well, we're gonna start with
the weight here.
- Yeah.
- So it's gonna go up and down.
- Ooh, ooh.
- And then you're gonna go...
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Do you feel it?
- Shake it, don't break it.
Oh, yeah.
I think I just lost five pounds!
- Feel it.
Ha, ha!
- Stacy, you better come up with
something quick.
- Okay, we need to come up with
something else
because I just heard "shake
and bake" over there.
- Well, we'll just change
the name of it.
- What are you thinking, Stacy?
- Spritz stick.
- What?
- A spritz stick.
- What the hell's
a spritz stick?
- I do think that Stacy's
a lovely person.
And you know, we'd probably have
a really fantastic time
listening to bullfrogs and
drinking sweet tea in the
backwoods that she lives in.
But I would lose my mind if we
had to be on the bottom
because of her.
- Well, hello, ladies.
all: Hello.
- Manila,
you're the team captain.
- Yes.
- What is your area of expertise
in this workout video?
- The step and strap.
Works your core muscles.
You bend down and strap your
heels together.
- Have you done it yourself?
Have you tried it yet?
- Girl, no.
- No.
Great, just let the camera roll,
and step and strap.
- Yeah.
- Manila was just clueless.
You have to be prepared
in front of Ru.
- Stacy, do you have
an area of expertise
that you're doing in the video?
- My name's actually
the sit and shake.
- The sit and shake?
- Lets you eat your chips.
And while you're doing that,
feeding your face,
you can just shake it off,
like, you know?
- I like it.
Yeah, but what if you don't have
one of these things here?
- A can of soup will be just
fine.
- Okay, I love it.
What about you, Mimi?
What are you doing?
- You gotta love me jump rope.
And it's when you got that man
that you don't wanna lose...
- Yes.
- You can jump rope, grab him,
tie him up, and don't ever
let him leave.
- Now just be careful jumping
rope with heels--safety first.
- Of course.
- Now...
Shangela, what
is your expertise?
- This is the hallelula hoop.
Kate Gosselin, she learned this,
and then she loaned me
this hair.
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- You get your hallelula hoop,
and then you say...
and that'll keep your hip.
And the hula hoop hits
the ground.
Ru is probably thinking,
"This ho don't even know
how to hula hoop."
Now listen...
- Okay.
- If it goes down--you see,
I'm single.
- [giggles]
- But if it goes down, you talk
dirty to it
and it'll rise back up.
- Oh, I see.
- Cardinal rule.
- Everybody is very funny on my
team.
I'm very concerned about that,
'cause I don't--
I actually don't
do comedy at all.
- All right, Alexis.
- I'm going to be working out
my upper body,
using the stretch
your upper body.
- Oh, I see.
- And I'm using, of course...
lip gloss.
The "lapilaviar" stretch.
- So it's like a cross-training
thing?
- Yes.
- Your lips don't lie.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right, ladies, now remember,
your workout videos need to be
truly inspirational.
So I'm bringing in someone
to help you...
Stop the insanity!
Fitness guru and motivational
speaker Susan Powter
will be here.
- Whoo!
- To help you make this workout
video truly inspirational.
- Susan Powter?
I mean, she's legendary.
When I was growing up, I even
wanted to bleach my hair
as white as hers.
That was, like, my reference
when I went to the hair stylist.
- I've got a few words of
inspiration for you myself.
Don't fuck it up.
- [giggles]
- Bye.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Okay.
- Good job, team.
- Well, well, well!
Hello, team Manila.
Meet Susan Powter.
all: Hi, Susan.
- Welcome to the fitness world,
ladies.
- Our first exercise is called
the step...and strap.
- Give me more over-the-top
drag queen sexy.
- Step and strap!
- What's your name, honey?
- I am Manila Luzon, and you've
just worked out
to the step and strap.
- And that's a cut.
- Hi, everybody, my name is
Alexis Mateo.
And right now, we gonna--just
gonna work out all
our upper muscles.
- I think that was super cute.
I think you should go
over-the-top.
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Ocherat--
<i>y todos los de mas.</i>
- [laughing]
- Here we go.
The stretchy thingy-majingy.
Open the lip gloss, and we gonna
pull...your lips.
- Give me a little more
attitude.
- Stretch and lips,
stretch and lips.
Are you guys at home getting it?
You need to breathe.
[panting]
My titties were sweating.
[panting]
Yes, you just gotta stretch
thingy-majingy lip gloss
with Alexis Mateo.
- Super cute.
Super cute.
- Tough act to follow.
- [deep voice] Well, hello,
ladies at home.
We're gonna increase some energy
and get rid of that unsightly
bulge in your pants, ladies.
Grab the ball and violently bang
your crotch for ten times.
Here we go!
all: Ah!
Two, three, four...
- Raja's character was just
totally crazy.
I just thought
it was really crude.
Not what you're gonna expect
from a drag queen to act like,
basically a dude.
- They call it, in the
infomercial industry,
that soft to camera moment.
- Mm.
- Where you do the "and you
can!"
And then you go,
"and you can also."
- Ah.
- It's that moment.
Give me a little swear
this is gonna work
for you moment, please.
- A lot of times, things don't
go the way that you plan them.
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, that happens for a lot
of us out there.
But let me tell you something.
You pick up the hallelula hoop,
and you put it back around
your waist.
And you work the hallelula hoop.
One, two, three, four,
I don't want that boy no more.
Five, six, seven, eight.
I am gonna find a date.
- From your hips to god's lips.
- Hallelu.
- Yes.
- Shangela was adorable.
Shangela is always adorable.
Like a little puppy or kitty
cat, they're always gonna be
cute, no matter...if they're
shitting on your carpet.
- Well, how you doin'?
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.
Grab your plates, and we're
gonna take our sit and shake,
and we're gonna shake it.
Come on, girls.
- When you shake that, your
beautiful body shakes with it.
So if you're gonna be it, don't
just be it shoving shit in your
mouth.
Be it physically.
- Shake it!
Ooh, ugh.
- Excellent.
- Ooh, yes.
Shake it.
- Stacy Matthews surprised me.
I was so proud of her 'cause she
completely turned it.
And I say "get it, Stacy.
Eat that chicken, you bitch."
- Mm! Mm!
- Hello, everybody.
My name is Mimi Imfurst.
Take your jump rope...
chase after your man.
You're gonna grab him... oh!
Hold him up--
- Cut, cut, cut.
Just hold on a second.
Safety first, people.
We don't want anybody
to get hurt.
It's just feeling
a little disorganized.
Okay, everybody get up
and get untied.
- All right, here we go, jump.
Jump higher!
You gotta get higher, you gotta
find yourself.
I thought I did great.
I really wanted to create
a character
that really was memorable.
Quick, jump higher!
Faster, faster!
You wouldn't be able to forget
that voice.
'Cause perspiration is
inspiration.
- Team Carmen.
- Yes.
- Bitch, we ready to work it
out, and we're gonna pump it up.
Okay.
So...remember, catchphrase is
"work it out."
Work it out, work it out,
work it out.
Okay, so I just have a question.
Do I have to do it from here,
or can I walk in
and then start from here?
Or does it have to be very,
like, "welcome?"
- You can walk in.
- Do I get a little...?
Hello, everybody.
My name is Carmen Carrera.
And I would--am so excited to
welcome you to work it out.
All right, ladies, we're ready
to pop a squat.
You're gonna work everybody's
favorite asset.
So we're gonna go down... up and
around.
Down again.
And up the other way.
- Cut for a minute.
Now Carmen, we're asking you to
make a connection with the
camera, but we're actually
making a connection
with your ass.
- Well, yeah.
- Hello, ladies.
I'm here to show you one of my
favorite workouts.
It's called the rubber tug.
Gonna lower it down, ladies.
One, two, three, four.
- It was a little low energy.
- Give me more face.
- Yes.
- You've gotta--
give me more of that.
- Inspire us to get up off
the couch.
- Okay.
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna place it under our
toe, ladies.
Pull up...
- Oh!
- And down...
- Ah, it doesn't matter.
- [laughing]
- One, two, three, four.
- I was actually--it was
exciting watching the girls back
there, 'cause they were camping
it up a little bit.
- When you're making a video,
you have to express your
personality, and you have to
convince.
And I didn't get that from
India.
- Hi.<i> </i>
<i>Hola!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> [speaking Spanish]</i>
'Cause you like Latin guy...
[claps]
You have to work your body,
darling.
If you don't understand me,
don't worry--I will include
a translation
at the end of the video.
- [laughing]
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>
You gonna step on the step, and
you gonna cha, cha,
<i>echar pa'lante!</i>
Cha, cha,<i> echar pa'lante!</i>
- I feel like I am making a
workout video with Uber-Charo.
- Oop-a!
- And we are going to go ahead
and show you how to keep a tight
snatch to make sure that you
keep your man so he don't have
to come and bother me, okay?
- Get to what you're doing,
don't tell me what you're doing.
- All right, first you put your
ball...
in a nice, delicate position.
And stretch.
Ah, and bring it back.
And stretch.
Do y'all feel that?
Ah!
- I liked Mariah.
She did not bring it,
she did not have conviction.
You're sitting in front of
RuPaul and you're a drag queen,
you better pull it together.
- All right, I feel like my
snatch has been aired out.
- Hey, ladies, my name is Delta.
We're gonna start with one of my
favorite exercises,
the shake and bake.
We're gonna start with the small
weight.
Squeeze your boobs together,
that's always a good asset.
One, two, three.
Now if you're working out with a
partner, have them stand behind
you and reach around.
They can give you
a little bit too.
It's so fun to work out with
a partner.
- You should go over-the-top
with the shake.
Over-the-top! You like it?
Get vicious.
- One, two, three.
- Yes!
- Like that.
See how that feels?
Do it like that!
If you've got enough, you can
stick it right down inside there
and you can jump up and down.
This challenge started off to be
my worst nightmare.
But this challenge is gonna be
my strongest success.
- Nice job, team Carmen.
- Thank you.
- Now, ladies... tomorrow night
on the main stage,
come dressed in an outfit
that features
your favorite body part.
Because along with Susan Powter,
our extra special guest judge
will be la-luminous,
la-legendary...
Latoya Jackson.
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.
This is unbelievable.
I love Latoya.
I would jump up and get her.
- Go hit the showers!
- All right.
- Another day.
- Good morning.
- We're back in the workroom,
and today's runway challenge is
to pick something from your
closet that accentuates your
favorite or your best body part.
- I am wearing a dress that's
just low-cut, because I'm gonna
show off my boobs.
- I'm doing titties too, girl.
- Okay, there we go.
- I think I've showed it
already, so I 'm just gonna wear
something complimentary.
- Chaps.
You have a pair of chaps over
there you
about to put on, Carmen?
- I don't wanna be known as the
naked one.
That's not really what I wanna
go for.
And it just keeps coming up.
So I'm gonna do something that
Carmen would do, but just
a different kind of Carmen.
- Should I start out with a
ruffle cone?
- Yeah.
And then take it off?
Girl, I'm not, like, a skinny
twig.
You know, like, I look like a
football player out of drag.
And I will never look
like a woman.
My drag, it's more clown
than anything.
Did you always go by India?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- My brother's ex-boyfriend at
the time was my drag mother.
He got me started and he gave me
the name India Ferrah.
- Oh, so your brother's gay?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
That's really good.
- My family's really supportive,
so.
- That's so great.
My biological family, they threw
me out of the house.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Through all this--this awful
things that have happened to me
in my life, laughter is a way--
it's a coping mechanism.
Because if you can laugh at it,
you can deal with it.
- I think I worry too much what
people think,
and I've gotta get over that.
I was a little nervous 'cause,
you know, I got picked last.
Back at home, I'm a whole lot
more out,
and open, and humorous.
I mean, I feel like I'm not
myself here.
I'm not used to such big
personalities.
- Just be strong.
I've been on your team twice
now.
I've never been disappointed.
- Thank you, girl.
Well, you work it out just as
much, honey.
- Oh, that's 'cause I work in
the spirit of hallelu.
[laughter]
- When I frst came out,
I was like, well, I guess
this is perfect timing
for me to become a drag queen.
If I'm gonna be a queer, I might
as well be, like, the queeriest.
- The queeriest, yeah.
My interest in drag was just
because I loved clothes
and fashion.
- How was high school for you?
- I was picked on,
I was really awkward, I was
a little on the heavy side.
In my generation of growing up,
gay was just kind of disgusting
and kind of a subculture,
and drag kind of came
and saved me.
But it was hard.
I grew up in a very, like, Latin
neighborhood.
- You're in California?
- Mmm-hmm.
- So where'd you grow up?
- Gainesville, Georgia.
It's not a progressive city as
far as the thought process.
I didn't feel like there was
something wrong with me;
I just knew that people were
picking on me.
Kids don't understand that being
different
ultimately means you're gonna
become something special.
Even if you don't have, like, a
strong support system at home,
you have to get that
from within.
<i>[laughter]</i>
<i>- And what?</i>
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, hello, my dear.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- And I wanna welcome to the
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> family my good pal</i>
and makeup superstar, Billy B.
Hi, honey.
- Hey.
- I'm so glad you could get away
from Gaga to be with us.
- Thank you.
- And Susan Powter.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Thank you.
- And the multi-faceted yet
complex talents of Miss Latoya
Jackson is in the house tonight!
- Hello, gorgeous!
How are you?
- I am so happy you're here.
Welcome to my home.
- Why, thank you.
- This week, we challenged our
queens to make totally leotarded
workout videos.
Tonight, they're dressed to show
it off
and ready to pump you up.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Raja!
- Not a stitch of makeup on.
- None.
<i>- I've chosen my legs.</i>
<i>My inspiration for my outfit</i>
<i>was a milf/cougar who is sort</i>
<i>of waiting poolside for the</i>
<i>pool boy to come clean it up.</i>
- Nothing tastes as good as
skinny feels.
Manila.
It's very Manila Deville.
<i>- I wanna show off my face, so</i>
<i>I'm wearing a strapless dress,</i>
<i>pulling my hair up, so it's</i>
<i>very, like, "look at me."</i>
- She looks like Erte a bit too.
- Yes, it's very Erte.
- It's got bride of Frankenstein
in there too.
- Yes, his second wife.
Next up, Stacy Layne Matthews,
from back swamp to the main
stage.
<i>- My fat ass,</i>
<i>I'm gonna pull out</i>
<i>the skimpiest top that shows</i>
<i>off the biggest part of my</i>
<i>body, which is my tits.</i>
- Add a little R&amp;B in there.
- Rear and boobs. R&amp;B.
This is India Ferrah.
- Ooh, Rapunzel.
- X marks the spot.
<i>- I honestly chose the</i>
<i>see-through catsuit because it</i>
<i>shows my whole body.</i>
<i>I don't think anyone will have</i>
<i>trouble seeing my titties.</i>
<i>I mean, that's my favorite</i>
<i>body part.</i>
- Not a shy girl.
- She is training the ponies at
the circus.
- I think it needs a whip
though, for real.
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Look at those hips!
<i>- My best feature is</i>
<i>everything.</i>
<i>I'm gonna serve you hair,</i>
<i>face, hips, everything.</i>
- I love the glitter.
The sparkle is great.
- I'm blinded by her beauty.
Up next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Mimi in the leopard!
Isn't it Bette Midler?
- It is Miss Kitty.
<i>- I love my dress.</i>
<i>It's high camp, it's glamour.</i>
<i>And I think it's something</i>
<i>the judges haven't seen before.</i>
- Wow.
- Very slimming,
the butt looks good.
- Meow, meow.
- Up next, Shangela Laquifa
Wadley.
- Pull up to the bumper.
- Oh! Oh! Yes!
<i>- I choose to highlight my</i>
<i>shoulders.</i>
<i>The outfit that I had that</i>
<i>showcases my shoulders is one</i>
<i>I've had a little bit up my</i>
<i>sleeve.</i>
- She's giving you a little
Kardashian.
- She's giving Kardashian.
- She's the forgotten
Kardashian.
- This is Kiki Kardashian.
They call this queen Mariah.
- Bring the drama, Mariah.
- The elegance of brown.
- I love the hair.
And all the colors are
coordinating, aren't they?
<i>- My outfit, it complimented my</i>
<i>mood so much.</i>
<i>It was flowy, airy, sexy.</i>
- Milk chocolate is what it is.
- Milk does a body good.
Up next, Delta Work.
- Work.
- Ooh!
- All right, Delta.
- She looks like Delta Burke,
doesn't she?
<i>- I am geared up</i>
<i>for the judges.</i>
<i>I am ready to show the twins.</i>
<i>And I know that they're gonna</i>
<i>fall in love with my look.</i>
- Priscilla Presley happening
in there.
- A southern girl.
- John Waters would love her.
- I love that hair.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yara Sofia.
- Her legs are gorgeous.
Look at that.
<i>- I chose a short dress.</i>
<i>It is simple, but I am showing</i>
<i>my legs.</i>
- Is she wearing stockings?
Those are her legs!
- Those are her eyes.
- She bought them.
- She has the receipt.
- Carmen Carrera.
Oh, she's all grown up.
- Seductress.
<i>- I wanna show the judges</i>
<i>that I am versatile.</i>
<i>This beautiful gown is gonna</i>
<i>show off my beautiful ass.</i>
- All about Jersey right now.
- She's Jersey-licious
right there.
- Yes, ma'am.
Welcome, dolls.
Earlier, the judges screened
your workout videos.
You competed as teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.
Will the following queens
please step forward?
Stacy Layne Matthews,
Mimi Imfurst,
Yara Sofia, India Ferrah,
Alexis Mateo, Mariah.
Ladies...
you represent the best
and the worst of the week.
Raja, Manila,
Shangela, Carmen, Delta.
Good job this week, ladies.
You're all safe.
Leave the stage.
Now.
Ladies, it's time to face
the judges.
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.
Let's go to Miss Latoya Jackson.
- I love anything that sparkles,
of course.
And you are one sparkle.
It's just absolutely beautiful.
- Your look has, like, a moment
of retro Barbra Streisand
Hollywood glamour.
- As far as the video goes,
it was very Puerto Rican
Chrissy Snow.
- Yes! She was!
- From<i> Three's Company!</i>
- Yes!
- I thought that was
so different and clever
at the same time.
- Your one of the first
contestants
who brought real humor.
- Thank you, Alexis.
Next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Your video was much more
of a comedy skit.
<i>- Today we're gonna help you</i>
<i>find you.</i>
- You don't have to pull every
drag trick out of the hat
every single time.
- The video was a little bit
of a let-down.
It was like Divine meets
Sally Struthers.
- I really wanted to come in and
create a large character.
You know, I try to put the B
in subtle.
- It was hokey.
It was not good.
- I feel like you wasted
an opportunity.
Thank you, Mimi.
- Thank you.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
I guess I don't have to ask you
what body part you're featuring
tonight.
- You look so much like my
relatives.
Is she related and I don't know
it?
- The back swamp Jacksons.
- [giggles]
- I have to say, having eaten
chicken in your workout segment,
you actually made us laugh
with you.
- And to incorporate that
into an exercise,
I think you did an excellent job
on what you had to do.
- Thank you.
- I liked it.
I like what she did.
- What I really loved was seeing
a personality.
We need more of you, Stacy.
- India Ferrah.
- It's the hat with the feather,
and the ponytail to
the floor, and the glitter lips.
Your boobs out with Xs and a
tarantula or something
on your vajayjay...
there is so much going on.
I think, "well, what is she
covering up?"
- Is every outfit gonna be the
bosoms featured?
Because that's what we've gotten
three weeks in a row.
- Okay.
- As far as your workout,
I wasn't inspired.
I didn't feel that connection.
- There was nothing. There
wasn't even a joke.
It was nervous.
- You could tell she was scared.
<i>- Looking at the video, what</i>
<i>would you have done</i>
<i>differently?</i>
- You know, more inspirational
words.
- It's not just the words.
Inspiration has to come from a
sincere place inside of you.
Thank you, India.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia.
You took a potential liability,
which is your accent, and you
made it work for you.
- That whole Latin thing and
that sexy swish,
you had everyone roaring.
-<i> Echar pa'lante!</i>
<i>If you want that guy, you have</i>
<i>to work it out, darling.</i>
- I think you are so hot.
I just have a problem,
outfit-wise.
- I can take it off if you want.
- [laughs]
Well, thank you very much,
darling.
Up next, Mariah.
What body part were you
featuring?
- My face.
- I love the fact that all the
different browns coordinate
with you quite well.
And they work.
- And then there's, like, this
Vegas makeup
that I think cheapens you,
and I think you're too pretty
for that.
- During the workout video,
I think your own sincerity
didn't shine through, and we the
audience didn't believe you.
- If you could think of your
personality
as your face, get that same
confidence,
it will take you to another
level, and that's the truth.
- Well, girls,
we have heard enough.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the interior
illusions lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Okay, now just between us girls.
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.
- I think she nailed
the bloody workout.
- I thought she was
the funniest one.
- Yeah.
- I like the energy.
- You worked in a workout video.
- Yes, I did.
- Was it difficult for you?
- It was, because unlike Susan,
I had never worked out before.
And I still don't work out
this day.
So I think once you start-- my
sister, she has to do it all
the time because
that's what she does.
- Right.
Let's move on to Mimi Imfurst.
The workout she did,
it wasn't funny.
- It was stupid.
- [laughing]
- Seriously.
- Right, it'd be a different
story if her shtick had
inspired us or at least made us
laugh.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Thing is, Mimi's always been
teetering
throughout the competition.
And I think she may have gone to
the other side.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
During her workout routine,
something was coming out.
- I know!
- There was potential.
- I like the fact that she made
fun of herself.
However, I don't feel that she
has what it takes to be
the next drag queen.
I just don't think so.
- Will she be in the bottom two?
That's the question.
India Ferrah.
- I hated the way
that she looked.
- I liked her so much.
I liked her.
- She's got a good energy.
She tried to do the double
entendre
with the rubber and the double X
magnum thing.
It just came off dirty
and not clever.
- Bottom line is,
her workout was boring.
- Yara.
Now what she did in that workout
was hilarious.
Who knew that she would do that?
- She's very sexy.
- Yes.
- Extremely sexy.
- She needs to burn
that dress though.
- You have it out for her
and that dress.
- I hated the dress too.
- Mariah.
I wasn't crazy about the snatch
tightening thing.
- It was like, eh.
- It was gay cruise humor.
- And the delivery wasn't good.
- Not at all.
- She has a beautiful face.
- For this title,
pretty isn't enough.
- All right...
[claps]
Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your totally leotarded
workout videos
and your performance
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia, your joy and
enthusiasm need no translation.
Condragulations, you're safe
from elimination.
Alexis Mateo...
combining lip gloss with your
thingy-majingy, you've created
a new workout craze.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
You will receive a $2,500 gift
certificate to gilt.com.
Yes, that's gilt.com.
Plus immunity from elimination
next week.
Thank you, Alexis.
- Thank you guys so much.
- India Ferrah...
On the runway, your look
was too much.
In the challenge,
you gave too little.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
<i>- My knees start shaking, and</i>
<i>I'm just standing there like,</i>
"oh, my god, what am I gonna
do?"
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
In your challenge, you ate
the scenery...literally.
And you made us laugh with you.
But still, we feel you are
holding back.
Condragulations, you're safe...
for now.
- I'll bring it.
<i>I think RuPaul gave me</i>
<i>a second chance.</i>
And I just want to be more open
and be myself
so people can actually see who I
really am.
- Mariah...
you are a bronze beauty.
But your workout performance
was pale.
Mimi Imfurst...
you showed us your glamorous
side on the runway.
But in the challenge, your
slapstick got sloppy.
Mariah, condragulations,
you're safe.
- Thank you so much.
- Mimi Imfurst...
I'm sorry, my dear, but that
means you are up for
elimination.
<i>- When Ru says that I'm in the</i>
<i>bottom two,</i>
I'm totally surprised.
I think that now anything goes.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life!
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
<i>- I'm like, "well, bitch, step</i>
<i>it up."</i>
<i>You gotta make sure that you're</i>
<i>always the one that's in front.</i>
[low growling]
<i>- What the hell</i>
<i>is she thinking?</i>
You can't be lifting up
drag queens.
<i>- I was honestly scared.</i>
<i>And all I could do was scream.</i>
Get her off of me!
- [laughing]
- Whoo!
[applause]
- Ladies...
I have made my decision.
Mimi Imfurst...
Drag is not a contact sport.
India Ferrah...
Shante, you stay.
- Whoo!
- Mimi Imfurst...
you are, and will always be,
part of an elite group
of drag queens.
Remember that.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
[sniffs, sighs]
<i>I don't agree with the judges.</i>
<i>I don't think I should've been</i>
<i>in the bottom two.</i>
I know what I do best, I do me.
And I'm just gonna keep
doing me.
I'm Mimi Imfurst.
Not Mimi, I'm like everyone
else.
- And to my girls...
condragulations.
And remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play.

-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
There is no place like
the U.S. of A...
- No foam here.
100% American, made in the USA.
- Wah!
- Papi, I want you to come back
home, baby!
- Alexis Mateo,
you made us proud.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- I wanna say thank you to that
special person
that's shown me that I needed
to love myself first.
- Ladies...I have made
my decision.
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
no one is going home tonight.
- What?
- And tonight, Rupaulapalooza!
- Ooh!
-<i> The dolls hit a high note.</i>
-<i> But some fall flat.</i>
No.
-<i> And extra-special guest judges</i>
<i>Jody Watley and Carmen Electra.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Buon giorno, buon giorno.
- Back again, new day.
- We're all still here.
It's a new day, and there's
still six of us...
<i>because no one went home, so...</i>
<i>we'll see what's gonna happen.</i>
- Why do you think Ru gave us
another opportunity?
- Honestly, I think that Ru
feels like
she says--like we're both really
fierce queens.
Like if I was anyone else in
this competition,
I might feel a little bit like
oh, shit, like...
Ru feels like we're too good
to go.
I would be nervous.
- Can somebody just slap her
and wake her up?
- I wasn't expect to be in
the bottom two.
- You never expected--
- And, yes, I know--and I know.
I know, I know, but...I still
have something to learn.
I appreciate that RuPaul give me
another opportunity.
I cannot fuck it up.
[siren]
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got she mail!</i>
Hey, dragsters.
all: Hey!
- Listen up.
Can you hear that?
It's herstory calling.
<i>Learn to embrace the past.</i>
Make it your own...and you just
might be America's next
drag superstar.
Hello, hello, hello!
Hi...my gorgeous queens.
Now, to kick things off, we're
gonna play a little game
of Rusical chairs.
all: Oh!
-<i> It's a lot like</i>
<i>musical chairs.</i>
When the music stops,
who's ever left standing
has to finish the lyric.
If you get it right, you get
to give a queen the boot.
But if you're wrong, you're out.
Oh, and you have to play
the game wearing high heels.
- Oh, of course!
[laughter]
-<i> Are you ready?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes!
- Let the music play.
[music stops]
- Oh!
- Ah ha!
- Carmen is left standing.
What lyric comes next?
- Um...
- Ding ding ding ding ding!
<i>You got it!</i>
- Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!
- You get to give one
of the queens the boot.
- I choose...Shangela.
- I knew it was me.
- Bye!
- Let the music play!
[music stops]
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Carmen, dear, are you on
a five-second delay
or something?
What lyric comes next?
- I got to think about this one.
[laughter]
I'd rather something than try to
fit in.
Damn, these bitches got me.
- I'm sorry, Carmen,
but you are out.
You may join Shangela.
Let the music play.
[music stops]
- Oh!
- Ha ha!
- That is right.
Ha ha ha ha!
- Get out, girl!
all: Oh!
- There are two chairs left
and three queens.
[music stops]
- Ha ha ha ha!
All right, Yara.
- Can't wait to hear this.
I don't know!
- Time is up, Yara, I'm sorry.
But go ahead and join
the other girls.
Okay, we have two girls
and one chair.
Sounds like a video you can
watch online.
[laughter]
Okay. Let the music play.
[music stops]
both: Aah!
- Ah ha ha!
- All right, Raja.
Do you know the lyric?
- Mm...
-<i> We have a winner!</i>
- Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!
Ow!
- Now, it is time to pump up
the volume.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll need to find inspiration
from the vast herstory of music
to perform in a ladyboy music
festival
we're calling...
Rupaulapalooza...
sponsored by Absolut vodka.
Please welcome Jeffrey Moran.
[applause]
all: Hi!
- Hi, guys.
There are a couple of things
I think you need to know as you
go through the competition.
You need to let your personality
show through.
We really wanna see that you
know who you are.
<i>Show us what it means to be</i>
part of this family and part
of Absolut.
- Now, ladies, this week
each of you will record
the brand-new RuPaul song
<i>Super Star.</i>
all: Ooh!
- But each of you will be
interpreting it in a totally
different
<i>and timeless musical style.</i>
<i>Your options are hip-hop...</i>
<i>country...</i>
<i>disco...</i>
<i>reggae...</i>
<i>punk, or pop.</i>
Now, Manila, since you won
the mini-challenge,
<i>you get to choose first.</i>
And then one at a time,
you decide who chooses next.
- I'm gonna go with...
bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo...
disco!
- Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah!
- Now, Manila, who gets
to choose next?
- We'll go with Raja.
- I want punk.
-<i> Who gets to go next?</i>
- Yara.
- Yara gets to go next.
<i>Come on over, Yara.</i>
-<i> Manila picks Yara, not Carmen.</i>
What happened to Team Heather?
- I'm gonna take pop.
- All right, Manila,
who goes next?
- Alexis.
- Alexis.
- Thank you, Manila.
- I get what you're trying to
do, Manila,
but girl, just pick
the Heathers.
Who cares about those boogers?
Girl, stop being fair.
- I'm gonna take the hip-hop.
- All right, mami.
- Next is Carmen.
- Next is Carmen.
- Finally.
- Carmen, are you feeling
coun-try?
Or are you feeling reg...gae?
- I really like reggae.
So I'm gonna go with reggae.
- Okay!
And of course, that means,
Shangela, you are our
country queen.
- I'm straight out
of Paris, Texas,
and I'm going to hold onto
the country.
- All right, ladies, before
your recording session,
<i>you'll have time to rehearse</i>
<i>and put together</i>
an appropriate performance
outfit.
<i>Until then, gentlemen...</i>
start your engines...
and may the best woman win!
- Carmen Carrera.
Join us here on
<i>Alexis Mateo Show.</i>
<i>You have any questions</i>
<i>for our comedy queen?</i>
- No, I thought you--I thought
you was gonna ask--
I thought this was your show.
- I'm giving you the free option
to say something to her before
we continue
just criticizing you.
[laughter]
Manila just took me by surprise.
- I wasn't expecting her
to pick me first.
I know her.
She would have said okay.
<i>Now, who do I think's gonna try</i>
<i>to turn this competition?</i>
I don't want them to have
the music they want.
- I don't really read into
those things.
I think that some people might
want to, you know, stir up
some drama because of that, but
I think that's why she did it.
- Oh, I don't think nobody's
trying to stir up drama.
<i>But you can be stupid all day</i>
<i>long,</i>
pretend to be aloof,
but I know better, honey.
You go play that one with
somebody else.
- I think Alexis and Shangela
wanna start drama.
Fuck those hos.
Who cares?
Maybe she did and maybe
she didn't.
I don't know.
I'm gonna ask that bitch.
Gonna ask her now.
<i>They're trying to say that</i>
<i>you're trying to sabotage me</i>
because I only had two options
instead of four,
and I should have been called up
there after this bitch.
- You know what, honey,
it's not shade.
I'm not strategizing
besides myself.
- Oh, so you're being selfish.
- Going down the line was like
the easiest and fairest
way to do it, 'cause I don't
wanna start drama
being like picking you guys
first and then having
all the other girls being like,
"Oh, Manila's just picking
the Heathers."
- I actually wanted the reggae
one, actually, so...
- Well, then it worked out,
so what are you fucking
complaining about, bitch?
- I'm not complaining about
anything.
<i>Don't get me twisted, honey.</i>
- You know what? No.
<i>Carmen's trying to start up</i>
<i>some motherfucking drama!</i>
She's turning into Shangela.
<i>The main challenge this week</i>
<i>is we have to record</i>
<i>our own version</i>
of RuPaul's new single
<i>Super Star,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and we have to perform it in
front of a live audience.
- [laughing]
- It is battle of the vocals
right now.
<i>Everyone is doing their song.</i>
- Girl, I thought I was at
the audition for<i> Glee.</i>
- [off-key]
- Yara sounds horrible.
- Maybe tone is lost in
translation.
- She don't sing it in Spanish.
She doesn't sing in English.
[laughing] She doesn't sing in
any language.
- Bah!
- Hello, hello, hello,
my superstars.
all: Hello.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Lady reggae.
- Yes.
- Does this challenge
frighten you at all?
- No, this excites me.
- Because you were
in the bottom two...
- Maybe I might have a little
bit more to prove,
but I like a challenge.
I'm not gonna try to fake it,
you know?
I'm just gonna sing like I do
and gonna go with something that
I can pull off.
- Irie, man.
One love.
- Okay.
- Well, hello, Raja.
- Hi, gorgeous lady
of wrestling.
- [laughs] Yes!
So why'd you choose punk?
- As much as I wanted to be a
punk rocker as a teenager,
I was way too glamorous up here.
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Like I could not stick
a safety pin in my nose.
I might bleed, it might hurt.
- You've been criticized for
over-thinking your challenges.
You're very cerebral.
What is your strategy to sort of
break out of that?
- Well, you know, this is
a perfect one for me
because I can finally go balls
to the wall.
- Something that's always worked
for me is to remember
that what other people think
of you...
- Right.
- Is none of your business.
- Yeah.
- That--that's their--
that's them.
All right, Raja.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Get back to work.
- Right. See ya later!
- Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- Do you have your disco moves
together?
Can you do the bump?
- Yes.
- Can you do the double bump?
Uh-uh.
You got it, kiddo.
- Yara Sofia!
The new princess of pop.
- Yes.
- Do you know how to sing
at all?
- Um...yes.
- You do? [laughs]
There was a little hesitation
there.
- Yes.
<i>I'm not the best singer.</i>
I'm an actress.
You have to believe it.
And in front of the mirror,
I'm gonna practice--
<i>"I'm a singer, I'm a singer,</i>
<i>I'm a singer,"</i>
and I'm gonna sell it.
- I'm very glad I kept you
around,
because I'm very excited to see
your pop princess.
- You're gonna love it, darling.
- Hey, Shangela.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, you got stuck with
country.
Would you have chosen it?
- It's not about the song.
- Yeah.
- It's the look.
There's the traditional,
you know,
Jessica Simpson, these boots are
made for walkin' kinda look.
- Yeah.
- And then there's
Carrie Underwood concert.
- That is quite a conundrum
because a lot of people are
gonna expect...
- Jean skirts and plaid tops.
- You're just gonna have to
follow your heart on this.
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
- [laughing] Hey, Ru.
- Whassup?
- I got the hip-hop.
- And you chose this.
- Yes.
I'm modeling myself after
Lil' Kim.
- Uh-oh!
- [laughing] Yes!
- Uh-oh, the queen bee?
- I love Lil' Kim.
Ru knows I am hip-hop.
[pops tongue]
- Keep it hood and, um...
- Peace.
- Peace.
Bam!
- Bam!
[pop]
- All right, ladies,
in a few moments,
you'll be headed to
a professional recording studio.
- [whooping]
- Now, tomorrow on the main
stage,
you'll be debuting your version
of<i> super star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> in front</i>
of a live audience.
<i>We'll be joined by our</i>
<i>extra-special guest judges,</i>
<i>Grammy-award winning artist</i>
<i>Jody Watley...</i>
- Ooh!
- Hey!
- Jody Watley is an amazing
performer.
So I'm excited that someone on
that judge's panel
is gonna finally be looking at
performance over look.
-<i> And the sizzling hot</i>
<i>Carmen Electra.</i>
- Wow!
- Whoo!
- So whatever you do...
don't fuck it up.
- [snickers] Shangela.
She looks like Mystique's
country realness.
- Poor Shangela.
I mean, she's got country and...
ugh!
It's tragic.
How's Shangela gonna do
in country?
- I think she's gonna rely what
she's been relying on this
whole time--
being a loud mess.
<i>I don't know what the hell</i>
<i>Shangela's wearing right now.</i>
<i>Like she just cut a piece</i>
<i>of fabric,</i>
<i>and it's all uneven</i>
<i>and it just--</i>
it's not making any sense to me.
- I hope that I don't get ragged
for not coming out there
in a cowboy hat, you know,
in a denim skirt, but...
it's not that.
<i>It's more this.</i>
This is Carrie Underwood
concert.
You know what--you know what
I mean?
- She's somehow got her way
through
with fucked-up outfits before,
so, you know, we'll see
what happens with her.
Bless her little heart.
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Shangela.
- I'm Lucian.
- Today our main challenge is
to record RuPaul's song
<i>super star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in a specific musical genre.
- Have you been in the studio
before?
- No. I have not.
- This is your microphone.
Steve is in the booth.
He's gonna help us out.
- Lucian produced RuPaul's CD
<i>Champion.</i>
<i>This is real!</i>
<i>It makes me feel like</i>
<i>I'm already</i>
a musical recording artist.
-<i> The melody that you're singing</i>
there seems a little different.
- Okay.
- Are you changing it on
purpose?
-<i> I may have taken it too high</i>
<i>with the "oh."</i>
- What I would say is that--
- But I'll do it...
and then I'll take your feedback
on it.
I'd love to record one more
time,
and then that way I can get
the timing down for the intro,
so you guys may not have to do
any editing,
which would be nice.
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
- It seems like Shangela might
benefit
from being less confident.
[laughs]
- Anything else that I can do to
make it better?
No is okay too.
<i>[laughing]</i>
- It's gonna be my first
experience as a singer okay?
So...easy on me.
-<i> Oh, okay. All right.</i>
It's really scary, though.
- It is?
It's been a while since we have
seen a hot, gorgeous guy.
Bam!
I cannot concentrate.
- Okay...
There's a lot to go over here.
- What you didn't like?
- You sound terrified.
- I am terrified.
- Your vocals are like...
oh...oh...
- Shaking?
I know! I'm nervous.
-<i> I know.</i>
What would make you not nervous?
- We cannot say that on TV.
[pop]
[music ends]
- Yeah, it's those upper notes
that are a little like...
- So I'll just like push harder.
- Well, don't think push.
Just think power.
- Okay.
- Here we go.
[stronger]
[music ends]
Okay, if you can run some
auto-tune on that,
that'd be great.
[laughter]
- Just enunciate the words
a little bit more and make it
a little more prettier
in that girl punk way.
<i>[laughs]</i>
What does that mean?
- Sounds like you have a deeper
voice
than the key of this song.
- I'm kind of a more edgy gal.
<i>I don't wanna compromise</i>
<i>my voice</i>
and fuck it up by doing
something
that's out of my range.
- We gotta figure out how to
make you sound less
"I can't find the right..."
- The right tune.
Right.
<i>I can't wait to perform in</i>
<i>front of a live audience,</i>
and I just hope that
the recording...
the look, all of it goes well
so that the audience
can love it.
Yeah, there is definitely
pressure.
- Maybe we should play it back
so you can hear...
and then maybe we can figure out
a game plan.
- I'm doing reggae.
- Okay.
- But I don't wanna be like...
old-school,
like with the accent...
- You don't wanna play up any
comedy here or anything.
- Yeah, I think that's--that's
not really my thing.
- Well, this is the microphone.
- Okay.
This is to catch my spit,
I guess?
- It's actually to block
the air from...
- Oh!
[off-key]
[laughing]
I'm sorry.
Hearing my voice
is freaking me out.
- Do you think that you're
performing right now?
- Well, I don't sing,
so it's like is there a way that
you can throw in
some extra things in the beat?
The beat is so like...
da da da.
- Reggae is laid-back.
You have to perform it.
If you were in a club
and you were singing this
and there was a crowd of people
around you,
<i>what would you do?</i>
- I would sound like a mess.
But let's go, let's do it.
[music starts]
No.
- It's just not interesting
at all.
It's just like...just so flat.
If you don't give me something
more entertaining,
it's gonna be like...
[snaps]<i> Just do it.</i>
- I'm a little frustrated.
<i>Lucian just wants me to keep</i>
<i>going, give more.</i>
But this is not my thing.
- I think we're done.
- Oh! That was crazy.
Ah! Fuck.
I'm sorry.
Fuck.
- Okay, here we go.
From the beginning.
Fuck.
Sounds bad, right?
- It's still not great, no.
- Okay, uh, let's try--
keep trying, 'cause...
- Okay. Here we go.
- I'm sorry.
Is bad too?
- We should figure out the
best way
to make you...sound good.
- I'm doing my best.
I don't have the best...voice.
<i>But after being in the bottom</i>
<i>two last week,</i>
I'm gonna be a professional and
I'm gonna be more serious.
- You know, I have to give you
props, because you're workin'.
[laughs]
- Thank you, Lucian.
<i>Appreciate it.</i>
- I felt like Yara was always
trying hard, even,
<i>to make something happen.</i>
But I don't know that anything
ever really did.
[music ends]
[hip-hop]
- Recording artist Manila Luzon
is in the house!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yaaah!
- Oh, are those our music?
We walk into the workroom,
and and there are mp3 players
just waiting there
with our songs on them.
<i>Today we have to lip sync the</i>
<i>song we had just recorded...</i>
<i>super star!</i>
- Oh!
I gotta be alone.
<i>Hearing my voice</i>
<i>with the track and the lyrics,</i>
I mean, it was a full-on song,
and it was me singing it.
And I had never heard that
in my life.
I love it!
I love it, I love it!
I wanna do more.
It's good to have that feeling,
<i>'cause I'm an old jaded queen,</i>
and I just--I was, like, beside
myself.
- Whoo-hoo! I love it!
I'm so excited to hear my song!
I cannot believe it!
I can understand me!
- Wow, Yara!
- What?
- I love it--I can actually
understand you.
- Oh, shit!
I sound sickening!
I sound ten times better
than what I was expecting to
sound like.
- It's awesome!
- It sounds great!
Bam!
-<i> So I got my track.</i>
<i>I'm listening to it.</i>
But I'm like, oh...my...God.
I don't like the way it sounds
right now.
- I wanna hear yours.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I need to learn mine.
I don't like the song
personally,
so I'm not gonna go around
and like spreading my bad song
to everyone.
I wanna keep it to myself and be
like, all right,
let me think of a plan in order
to make this work.
- So, Heather, what did you
think of your recording session?
How'd it go yesterday?
- It went well.
I like it.
- Now that we have our music,
I was like, "Oh, dang,
I don't know about this."
<i>It's kind of weird to hear</i>
<i>my own voice.</i>
<i>Trust me; it sounds a lot</i>
<i>better in my head,</i>
but there was really nothing
left to do
except to perform
the hell out of it.
This is gonna be interesting.
- Oh...making a cowboy hat?
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you rhinestone the trim?
- Uh-huh.
- That's cute.
Do you need more rhinestones?
I have some more.
- Mm-mm. I have some more.
Oh, you sure you don't wanna put
some more rhinestones on that?
<i>That was not her trying to help</i>
<i>me.</i>
<i>That was her trying to get into</i>
<i>my head.</i>
- Well, these are pretty
rhinestones, gir.
- Thank you.
[dramatic music]
[RuPaul laughing]
[music plays]
<i>Well, hello there!</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, a name
that's music to my ears.
- Aw, go on.
- Jeffrey Moran...
<i>Absolut brand czar.</i>
Baby, we gotta stop meetin'
like this.
- Yes, honey, but in that dress,
we're gonna meet a lot more
often.
- [laughs]
Jody Watley.
Not only are you one of my
favorite singers,
you're my favorite<i> Soul Train</i>
dancer.
- Thank you!
- Carmen Electra, welcome!
I feel so Paisley Park tonight.
- Yes, very!
- This week, each of our queens
was challenged to record my song
<i>Super Star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>in a different style.</i>
Now they're here to perform in
front of a live audience
at Rupaulapalooza,
sponsored by Absolut.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[music plays, applause]
[whooping]
<i>I just unfold my wings.</i>
<i>I'm giving you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Soul Train</i>
<i>realness, honey.</i>
<i>I know I look good.</i>
<i>I'm feelin' fabulous.</i>
Whoo-whoo!
Alexis is serving hip-hop.
- [whooping]
- Bam!
- Can I get a hallelu?
<i>Everyone looks wired.</i>
They might as well be in
a country hoe-down,
<i>and I love that.</i>
<i>So I just start boot-scootin'</i>
<i>my way</i>
<i>right on across that stage.</i>
<i>I'm a little worried</i>
<i>about the audience...</i>
how they are gonna take this
ballad.
But at the end...people like
receiving me with open arms.
<i>I love it.</i>
[singing in native language]
<i>It's hard to get into character</i>
<i>and be, you know,</i>
<i>the sexy person</i>
performing to, like, the cats
in the alley.
<i>So I'm just trying to like do</i>
<i>something that's gonna</i>
<i>compensate</i>
for the horrible vocal.
[punk rock music begins]
- [whooping]
<i>I go out there, and I'm really</i>
<i>feeling my look.</i>
I want it to embody punk as a
philosophy and as a movement,
<i>and I just wanted to have</i>
<i>a great time out there.</i>
- [whooping]
- Ladies...
<i>it's time for the judges'</i>
<i>critique.</i>
Let's start with Manila.
- Ooh!
- [laughing]
- I thought the lip sync
could've
been a little more on point.
I wanted to feel like you were
singing it a little bit more.
- I was surprised that you went
directly to the audience,
as soon as you came onto
the stage.
I felt you grabbing
at the audience too early.
- Okay.
- Your moves were great.
You had really super moves,
and I pray to god there's a
bottle of Absolut
hidden in that fro somewhere.
- There's actually a whole case.
- The song was totally late '70s
<i>After School Special</i>
starring Scott Baio theme song,
which I love.
And you look gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
<i>Now, tell us about your outfit.</i>
- My outfit was inspired
by Lil' Kim.
- Uh! Bam!
Girl, I think you got Missy
Elliott stuffed up in there!
- Yes. Big ol' titties
and lotsa ass.
- Alexis sold it.
I could tell that you were
enjoying it.
<i>The lip sync was great.</i>
<i>Loved the rap.</i>
<i>- I'm a hip-hop girl,</i>
and this is like Hannah Montana
does hip-hop.
-<i> Hannah Montana?</i>
- All right, up next,
our country queen Shangela.
- Hey, y'all.
- You chose to do today's
country look
<i>like Carrie Underwood</i>
<i>and Taylor Swift.</i>
-<i> To me it was a little more pop</i>
<i>than country.</i>
I would have liked to have seen
something
just a little bit more
unexpected.
- You definitely came out
with the energy.
There's no question.
<i>But I think I almost saw that</i>
<i>energy getting the best of you.</i>
It got a little sloppy
sometimes.
- Your energy is always great.
<i>But I would have liked to have</i>
<i>seen</i>
a little more country stuff
in there.
- But I just--you know, I feel
that it's important that we just
are open-minded with regard
to country.
I know you guys are definitely
open-minded to that,
and so I appreciate all
your comments back.
- When we're sitting here,
we hear that song,
that's what dictated it.
It's not our preconceived notion
of country.
It's that [imitating banjo]
You know?
That's what you heard.
- All right, next up, our
pop princess Yara Sofia.
I love the fact that you put
some Spanish in there.
- Yes.
-<i> That was fantastic.</i>
- Thank you.
- I don't know if I would have
picked that outfit
for that version of the song,
<i>but you do look spectacular.</i>
- I appreciate that sex sells.
<i>I might have maybe covered up</i>
<i>a little skin.</i>
- Had you stood at the back
of the stage back there
for a little longer with
the mic stand,
you could have sold the ballad
a little bit more.
- Yes, you could have worked
the mic stand more,
but you connected
with the audience.
I love the glitter.
<i>It's very Britney MTV</i>
<i>Video Music Awards,</i>
<i>I'm a Slave.</i>
Britney wants her old body back
too, by the way.
- I bet she does.
[laughter]
Up next, our punk queen Raja.
We've been asking you here for
you to tap into that power
that you have when you walk
the runway,
and it looked to me like
you did it.
- I loved it.
<i>I loved the performance;</i>
<i>the lip sync was great.</i>
- You really owned the stage on
this one.
<i>I mean, I was there.</i>
<i>I felt like I could have gotten</i>
<i>in the mosh pit.</i>
- When I was 14, I had the same
hairdo, but it was blue.
<i>Everything was on tonight,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>
Your performance, your look,
your attitude, the emo...
Like, way on.
- Thank you so much.
<i>- Up next...</i>
lady reggae, Carmen Carrera.
Tell me about your outfit.
- Well, my outfit is kind of
like if Bob Marley
had a lovechild
with a Puerto Rican girl
and she grew up in jersey.
-<i> I love the outfit.</i>
There was some problems
in the lip sync.
It was a little off.
- So, now Jeffrey, she pulled
the guy up onstage,
but she left him there.
- Frankly, he diverted
my attention
a little too much from you.
This is about you.
You're going to be
the super star.
It made me feel like quality
impression...
and a little low on the
delivery.
- I sound horrible,
but that's okay--I'm a man.
- You didn't sound horrible.
You didn't--you just--it felt
that you weren't committed
to the vocal.
Ladies, $75,000 is at stake.
<i>And the decisions get harder</i>
<i>and harder to make.</i>
And I need your help.
Who should go home tonight
and why?
Raja.
- Oh, man.
I fucking hate this question.
You know what, I--
oh, God.
I would Shangela,
only because, you know what,
clearly you could go down
the line,
you can tell which genre
of music every one,
for the most part,
and then, you know, it just kind
of gets lost
as far as her look.
- Carmen, same question.
- I have to agree with Raja
because I feel that there's
always a look issue.
You need to look the part
if you're going to be
a drag super star.
- Where look is definitely
important,
you have to be able to perform,
and you need to be able
to connect,
and obviously she didn't do that
tonight,
and she has continuously not
done that
throughout this competition,
and that's truly why I feel
Carmen Carrera
should be the one who goes home
tonight.
- Alexis Mateo.
- I'm going to pick Carmen
Carrera as well,
and I think she's resting
and pretty.
- All right, girls,
I think we've heard enough.
Now while you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
girls...
<i>We'll start with Manila.</i>
Now, I have never enjoyed
a performer
to come out and immediately
attack the audience.
- I loved the fro,
and I love what she delivered,
but I think I'm with you.
I don't want her attacking
that audience.
- I think she looked good;
her costume and the whole
package.
And I love that she attacked
the audience.
Good for her.
-<i> Alexis Mateo.</i>
- The good was she really did
own her performance.
- It's hip-hop.
We don't know you as that kind
of an artist,
and then you come out here.
You got a hip-hop hat on,
you got a girl hip-hop jacket
on,
and then the rest is stripper.
That's not hip-hop.
- I mean, what was she supposed
to wear,
some--she's supposed to sport
a sag and a wife beater?
- If I pick her up, we're going
to an interview
and I see those--you
gotta cover those up!
- Well, a big trend
in queens these days
are those latex boobs.
- Oh! I don't like the way
they look.
Those aren't breasts.
These are breasts!
- Oh! Girl!
- These are breasts!
- You don't have to tell me
twice.
Shangela, now, she made
a bold decision
to do today's country look.
- She didn't do it for me.
And I understand, you know,
the whole "I want it to be
current
and I want it to be now
country,"
like...fine.
But someone's paying you to do
something, sweetie;
you gotta deliver on that.
- I almost don't even remember
it,
it was so middle of the road.
- If you have to explain it,
it's not being projected.
It was a fail.
-<i> Yara Sofia!</i>
- That body is near-perfection.
- But with that said,
that voice is still there.
- [laughs]
- And I don't ever want to hear
her record again, just FYI.
[RuPaul laughing]
- I don't know, I thought she
had guts to get up here.
She sparkled.
I liked her.
-<i> Carmen Carrera.</i>
- The best thing about it for me
was the outfit.
- I saw...some style with
no substance.
- I think she's too
self-conscious
about looking anything other
than sexy.
- Right.
- And I do think she has the
goods,
like she's not moving past this
point of posing.
- That's her crutch.
So she really doesn't have to
bring anything else.
-<i> Raja.</i>
- A lot of performing
is owning it.
Raja just owned it.
- She walked out with those
Doc Martens
<i>and that little plaid number,</i>
<i>and I'm like, she got it!</i>
- She can study a look,
and she can get it,
and she works it on the runway,
but when it comes to emoting,
she's fallen short.
And, Michelle, you've seen this.
Do you think she's broken
through that?
- I think this was so in touch
with the core of who she is
that we can't really judge if
she's broken through or not.
- She represented the strongest
type of woman,
which I find so attractive.
And I wouldn't mind if she,
uh...
well, I guess she wouldn't need
to strap it on.
- No!
[laughter]
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
Now, based on your performance
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia, your performance
was graceful...
but your power ballad ran
out of gas.
You're safe.
Raja, the judges OD'ed on your
punk performance.
God save the queen.
<i>You are the winner</i>
<i>of this challenge.</i>
And you've won an original
custom gown by Marcomarco
from the House
of Infinite Radness.
-<i> I feel fantastic.</i>
Grew up being a little punk kid,
so it was kind of nice to get
to live that look.
And I deserve to win.
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
Your reggae was half-baked,
and your performance went up
in smoke.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Oh...God!
<i>I was in the bottom two</i>
<i>last time,</i>
<i>so for me, it's do or die.</i>
- Manila.
Your disco look rocked the boat.
You're safe.
Shangela.
Your attempt to explain away
your new country look
fell on deaf ears.
Alexis Mateo, your hip-hop was
just too damn strip hop.
Alexis Mateo...
You are safe.
- Thank you.
- Shangela, my dear, you are up
for elimination.
-<i> When Ru says that I'm in the</i>
<i>bottom two,</i>
my heart is beating so loudly
<i>because it's not time for me</i>
<i>to go home.</i>
<i>It's not.</i>
- Two queens.
Stand before me.
<i>Ladies, this is your last</i>
<i>chance</i>
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip sync...
for your life!
Good luck and don't...
fuck it up.
[music begins]
- It hurts me to say that
Shangela's kind of turning it
out.
<i>I mean, I'm rootin' for my</i>
<i>girl,</i>
but Carmen might be in trouble.
- Ooh!
[song ends]
- [whooping, whistling]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Shangela...shante, you stay.
- [exhales]
Thank you.
[whispers]
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
<i>my jersey girl.</i>
<i>You're a fierce queen.</i>
Do you believe in life after
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
Because I believe in you.
Now...sashay away.
[applause]
-<i> Ru's decision's Ru's decision,</i>
<i>and I respect her decision.</i>
<i>I think in this competition</i>
<i>it's about doing it</i>
<i>and doing it the best you can,</i>
and if other people do it
better,
then that's...
the reality of it.
But I am the most beautiful one
here,
and honestly, I would have liked
to get sent home by
somebody better.
-<i> Condragulations, girls.</i>
You have been turning it out
week after week, and so don't
even think of letting up now.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play!
<i>- Grand prize contributed</i>
<i>in part by AlandChuck.travel.</i>


<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll need to perform in
a ladyboy music festival
we're calling RuPaul-a-Palooza.
 I think she's gonna rely on
what she's been relying on
this whole time:
being a loudmouth.
 Can I get a halleloo?
 God save the queen.
Raja.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
 Fuck Yes.
 Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Shangela.
Shante, you stay.
Carmen Carrera.
Sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
I'm gonna give you an
opportunity to really wig out.
 [cursing in Spanish]
<i> Wigs fly.</i>
<i>And a tangled twist.</i>
[hissing like a cat]
<i>With extra special guest judges</i>
<i>Fantasia Barrino,</i>
<i>and Wayne Brady.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>The winner of RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race will receive</i>
<i>a lifetime supply of</i>
<i>Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
[car tires squealing]
 Good morning.
 We're back again.
 Top five, bitches.
 Oh, she wrote notes
for everyone.
 Says, "Raja, I love you."
Oh, my girl.
 Bye, Heather.
 I'm gonna miss her.
 In the workroom this morning
there's a huge, huge, void...
that used to be taken up
by Carmen's giant ass.
So I guess Raja, it's up to you.
You're the bitch now.
I appoint you.
 Gladly.
You know what, I've been so nice
this whole time.
And I'm not holding back
anymore.
If I win something
and I deserve it,
why not show it off
a little bit?
So I won.
 Watch out, darling.
Anything could happen.
One day you're in,
and the next day you're out.
 Suck it, bitches,
suck it, bitches.
I win, I win.
 I really don't give a fuck
about raja.
He just want to become a model,
but he's old,
and he looks like a man.
Shangela, you was
in the bottom two again.
 Oh, Lord have mercy.
 How was that, girl?
 You start to feel like,
I'm here again, why?
But you just gotta go back to,
you know--
 Yeah, wi to fi, you know?
 Who you are.
You gotta fight.
I feel like I have to work
harder to prove to everyone,
you know, that I deserve to be
here.
 And they keep talking
about you.
Like, they keep attacking you.
 'Cause they want me gone,
sister.
If Raja and Manila
really didn't think
that I was competition,
they wouldn't be
bothered about it.
They'd embrace me like Carmen.
[alarm sounds]
<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
Hello, ladies.
all: Hello!
 However you dippity-do it,
the next drag superstar has got
to keep her hair bouncing
and behaving.
It takes just one bad blowout.
You could be hair today,
and gone tomorrow.
And parting is such
sweet sorrow.
 Whoo.
 What?
 Something about hair, honey.
 Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hey!
 Hey, Ru.
 Now, every now and then,
we all have a bad hair day.
And that's when a ladyboy
really has to improvise.
Now for today's mini-challenge,
you need to make a dramatic
headpiece,
using only materials swiped
from the gay beach.
all: Ooh!
 Now, ladies.
You've got crabs,
beach balls,
grass skirts,
and a whole bunch of fun stuff.
Now there's 20 minutes
on the clock.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
 Yeah.
 Ooh, look at the fishy!
[high-pitched muttering]
I'm making this headpiece
with a fishy lace front.
[laughing]
 I want mine to be chic.
 Well, good luck, honey.
'Cause that looks busted
and crusted, girl.
 Honey, this is a Philip
Treacy Alexander McQueen, honey.
 Oh, you bitch.
Mama, stand up straight.
My headdress is falling over
and dying.
But at least it doesn't look as
jacked up as Shangela's.
 Ooh!
Oh.
 What kind of headpiece
is that?
Like, a parrot with a dolphin?
What the hell?
 All right, lady-kins.
all: Whoo!
 First up, let's take a look
at Raja's head.
Wow.
Now, have you had crabs before?
 Um, yeah, I actually pulled
these right out of my panties.
 [laughing]
Yara Sofia.
 Yaaaay!
 Beach party.
 Yaaaay!
 Girl, you are so fishy.
 Thank you.
It looks so real, right?
 Manila.
Showgirl.
It's very Ziegfeld.
 Although I need
a little Viagra,
or the pit crew to give it
a little inspiration.
'Cause she's starting to sag.
Like Raja!
 Alexis Mateo.
 Pat...
all: Ooh.
 I steal the head fish, bitch.
Look how I float.
 Yes, you are floating.
 I feel like in a boat fat.
Pfft!
[laughing]
 Shangela.
all: [giggling]
 Is that a parrot
humping a dolphin?
 [laughing]
 Mm-hmm.
 I don't know how natural
that is,
but somehow I'm strangely
stimulated by it.
Ladies.
You all had fun
with this challenge.
But...
I'm gonna have to go with Raja.
 Oh, shit!
 Raja is the winner of this
mini-challenge.
[laughing]
 She can jump around
and celebrate everything
that she wants to,
but I won too.
Hey.
 Ladies.
A queen's crowning glory
is her hair.
Now I'm gonna give you
an opportunity
to really wig out.
[cheers and applause]
 Oh, God.
 Oh.
 For this week's
main challenge,
you'll be competing
in a fantasy hair show.
You need to create
three distinct hairstyles.
First, a classic look
from another era.
Second, a modern look
worthy of a red carpet event.
And third, a far-out fantasy
hair extravaganza.
 Mmm, hey.
 Now, Raja.
 Yes.
 Because you won
the mini-challenge,
you get a five-second head start
at the wig bar.
 Oh!
 Provided by Wilshire Wigs.
So get going.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
 [screams]
 [laughing]
 What are you doing?
The extravaganza?
 Mm-hmm.
That's the one
I'm gonna work on first,
'cause I think that'll
take me the most time.
She ain't slick.
I know what she's doing.
Yara is brushing that wig,
and walking around,
looking at
everyone's creations.
Getting ideas.
What am I gonna do?
Hmm.
 I love doing hair.
 I think Yara's gonna do
really good at this one.
 Mm-hmm.
 'Cause you always have, like,
the craziest, wackiest hair.
 And Manila, how do you think
I'm gonna do with this
challenge?
 Um, I think you'll do fine.
 [laughing]
 Shangela, this is a comb.
 Ooh, girl!
 Oh, yeah.
 It goes through the hairs.
Mm-hmm.
 Thank you, Manila.
 Just sharing the knowledge,
Honey.
 These girls don't expect me
to have any creativity
or ability when it
comes to this.
It's a fire in me
to prove them wrong.
 Our main challenge is
creating
three different looks
of hair,
matching with
three different outfits--
the classic from another era,
a modern red carpet look,
and then we have
a fantasy creation.
 Alexis.
 What happened, boo?
 Which one are you working on
right now?
 My fantasy look.
That's gonna be my hardest part
of the challenge--
is going to be
to get that look together.
I normally work with my own hair
as a base.
So I'm gonna have to see
how it goes tomorrow,
because I can
actually style the pieces
that I'm gonna wear.
 Uh-huh.
 But it's not until it's
on my head
that you actually see
the final product.
 Right.
 Alexis is probably gonna have
this weird-looking Elvis
pompadour
with, like,
an<i> Avatar</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ponytail.</i>
I mean, this is what she does.
Shangela,<i> au naturale.</i>
Do you know what you're doing
for your era?
 Donna Summer
meets Diana Ross.
 Work.
 Yara.
 Huh?
 How you doing?
 This is my '80s look.
 An '80s look?
 Fros seem to be really
popular for a classic era.
 Hello, hello, hello.
 Hola.
 Hello.
 Hi, how are things
shaping up?
 Fierce, honey, fierce.
 Well, hello there.
Alexis.
Which is your classic look?
 I think I'm going for
the 1940s.
 Well, now, during the '40s
there was a rationing
on latex titties.
 Are you serious?
 Yeah.
 '40s look.
 Yes.
 Do you have it here?
 No.
 No?
What about your
red carpet hair?
 I'm going to go for
the evening modern mohawk.
 An evening
modern mohawk style.
And where's that?
 It's not ready yet.
 It's not ready yet?
Oh, Miss Thing.
Let's talk about your hair
fantasy-stravaganza.
 I saw this pink,
and it reminded me
of that cotton candy
that you get
when you go to the circus.
 Yes, yes.
 And that's my inspiration,
the circus.
 Your inspiration is
cotton candy from the circus.
 For the circus.
 Ah.
Hi, Shangela.
 Hey, Ru.
 How you doing?
Oh, this is
your hair fantasy?
 This is it.
We're on it today.
 Wow.
 Yeah, it's kind of like
an alien princess
from the future.
 It is quite the fantasy.
And you've got
your classic hair?
 Classic hair is very
Diana Ross meets Donna Summer.
 I'd love to wear that hair.
That is beautiful.
So you not being a hair queen,
are you asking for advice
from the other girls?
Just how to put things together?
 No.
I know and I'm learning
what looks great on me.
 Mm-hmm.
 And no one can tell you
what looks best on you
but yourself.
I mean, I know it's okay
to ask for help,
but I've kind of
gotten some feedback
from the other girls
that they're over me
asking for help.
 Right.
 So I can do things on my own.
 Good, good.
You got to, 'cause, you know,
we're down to the wire now.
 That's right.
 Yara Sofia.
 Yes.
 Hi, darling.
 Hi, darling.
 Tell me about your
classic hair look.
 I made this with braids.
 Uh-huh.
 On the cover.
And I mixed two afros,
two tones.
 I see.
 Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
You know, um, Shangela is doing
a little bit
of a--sort of a '70s afro.
It's big, curly hair.
Are you worried
about that at all?
 No, well, I made it first.
And when I see Shangela's
classic hair,
it looks like mine.
Even the brunette color.
I think Shangela's a copycat.
 Hey, Raja.
 Hi.
 So tell me,
what are you planning
for your red carpet look?
 I am taking some inspiration
from Janice,
from the Muppets.
 Uh-huh.
She's my favorite muppet,
I think.
 [imitating Janice]
"Hey, man.
Yeah, it's gonna be cool."
 Yeah, uh-huh.
Artistically,
what is your fantasy?
 Well, my fantasy would never
really involve a wig,
'cause the wig would be
pulled off, but...
 [laughing]
 Uh-huh, no...
I really don't know what my hair
fantasy is, to be honest.
 Now, listen.
I just want you to know
that we expect something
truly out of this world.
 Ru wants to see something
that's just gonna wow him
and, you know, take him
to another, like,
another realm, really.
And I definitely feel
a lot of pressure.
I am about to lose my mind.
 Hey, Manila.
 Hi.
 How you doing?
 Good.
 What you got there?
Sort of a rock me disco Amadeus,
isn't it?
 This is my classic look.
 That's your classic look.
 Yeah.
I thought it may be kind of cool
to do,
like, the mix of, like,
'80s meets 1800s.
 This is not
your fantasy look?
 This is my classic look.
 'Cause that's pretty fantasy.
That's--that's out there,
isn't it?
 It's a lot to explain.
 Some of the other girls
have gotten in trouble
for having to explain
what it is they're doing.
 Yeah.
 You know, it should be clear.
 Hits you over the head.
 Yeah.
 Make sure that everyone
gets it.
 Well, to quote Alexis Mateo,
it should say, "Bam!"
 The jig is up.
 You know what I'm saying?
 I will.
 Okay.
 All right, ladies.
Gather around.
Now tomorrow, we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judges--
the talented and hilarious
Wayne Brady...
 Whoo!
 Wow.
 Brady.
 And my favorite baby mama,
Fantasia.
For real.
No, for real, though.
I'm for real.
 Fantasia won<i> American Idol,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and I can't wait.
 In addition to debuting
your three hairstyles
on the main stage,
there's just one more
little detail
I neglected to mention.
I want you to create
a runway outfit
made entirely out of...
hair.
 [gasping] Oh, my god.
What am I going to do?
 You'll get more hair pieces,
toupees, falls, and merkins.
So y'all can really
get wiggy up in here.
 Like, really, Ru?
Really?
 Listen, the competition is
getting pretty hairy in here.
So don't fuck it up.
 Our main challenge today
is that
we're creating three
different hair looks
that has to correspond
to three different outfits,
and we have to create an outfit
out of hair!
There's so much to do,
and so little time.
You can feel the pressure on.
 We have to make a dress out
of nothing but wigs?
This is insane.
You gotta be kidding me.
 It's crazy,
that's what it is.
 That kind of changes
my whole, like, look.
 Me too.
 It's a giant challenge,
but yet it's like,
they tell you, like, later.
 Isn't that crazy, though?
That there's always a twist?
Just when you think
you have it down.
 Ooh!
Oh!
I almost melted my face.
Sabotage!
Ooh, girl!
It's jumping up in here.
[hysterical laughter]
 Are you losing it, girl?
Quit sniffing all those
adhesive fumes.
Yara is being wacky.
 [cursing in Spanish]
 But a part of me goes,
"Is she doing that
to distract the other girls
in the room?"
Oh, okay.
Miss Girl's got a strategy
of her own.
Ay! Ay! Ay!
 Oh, Christ on crackers.
 Aaiiee!
Oooh!
Aaah!
I mean, come on.
 Hee-hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 Really?
 I feel like I'm in some,
like, weird alien petting zoo.
It's, like, shut up.
 If you guys had a chance
to kill one of the other queens
in this competition,
who would it be?
 Yara Sofia.
 I never win the challenge.
And this time, I have to win.
Fuck, it's about time for me.
Um, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Darling, I need help.
 What, Yara, what?
 Do you like the combination?
 I like it, I like it since
you made it.
Yara is coming to my station
every five seconds
to ask me how her look is.
I mean, we're the top five.
Ain't no time to be
talking around
or playing with each other.
This is some real shit
right now.
You'll be all right.
 I hope so.
 If Carmen was still here--
 Mm-hmm.
 She would have just taken
two wigs,
glued them to her titties.
 Called it a day.
 I'm always having problems
with the proportions of my body.
Um, the wrong way.
And this challenge, I have to
wear my body, plus hair.
So for me to actually have
a silhouette on stage,
it's gonna
be very difficult.
My fantasy dress was not going
to the right place
that I want it to.
 Alexis finish her garment,
and now she's changing the dress
and cut it.
 Oh, you changed it,
like, fiercely, huh?
 It doesn't look like circus.
 I was wondering why you cut
it all apart.
It's important for me to do well
in this challenge because,
bitch, it's the top five.
I mean, I wanna be
part of the top four.
 It's good, but I don't know
if this could bother you.
 I put it on so it sits,
like, right here.
Fits okay.
 Can you glue hair?
 This is a creative high
for me.
I don't want to look
outward for help.
 It doesn't have to cover
the entire front.
 Okay, awesome.
 Just a design.
 Thank you.
 Shangela's outfit is a mess.
Hey, girl, listen.
You should learn
some new things.
 Have you tried your wig
on yet?
 I haven't even started it.
 This is all good in theory,
but let's see if it
actually stays on my head.
 This wig is, like, super,
like, Halloween-y.
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing anymore.
In<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history, this might</i>
be the craziest and hardest
and most stressful
challenge ever.
Time is getting shorter
and shorter and shorter.
 Piece of shit.
 Ow, son of a mother fucking
bitch!
It's do it or die.
[alarm clock buzzing]
 Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.
 Today, the clock is ticking,
honey.
Nobody's ready yet.
We are going crazy.
 I'm nervous,
'cause I still have to do
my modern, worthy of
a red carpet look.
 There's just so much
for everyone to do,
that everyone's really feeling
the pressure right now.
 I'm stressed out of
my fucking mind.
I can feel the veins
in my temples
and in my neck just pulsating
with, like--
[inhales]
I just need to get it done.
 Ready or not,
here comes mama.
 Manila, you're getting ready
already?
What about your modern look?
 Honey, I'm gonna
make it work.
It's gonna be a shake and go,
honey.
 Did you finish everything?
 Stop talking to me.
 Ha ha!
Bitch.
 I just wanna
get myself painted,
'cause if I'm in the bottom
and I have to lip-synch,
I at least want to be pretty
when I do it.
 I don't feel like
I'm gonna be there.
I've worked really hard.
I'm confident
in what I'm bringing.
 This has to be the most
difficult challenge so far.
But I'm actually finding
that I'm a lot better
at doing hair
than I thought I was.
 I've always wanted to be
in drag,
even when I was a little boy.
I used to sneak into
my sister's closet
and take all of her clothes
and wear them around.
 Drag made me be
who I want to be
whenever I wanted it to be.
It just gives me that freedom.
 Freedom.
 Yeah, it's like a vacation.
You can take a vacation
every night.
 Exactly.
And you get paid for it,
and it's even better.
To me, it's like
my artistic expression.
 It's--I know,
it's your creation.
 Everybody cannot do drag.
 I think everybody
should have the right
to do drag if they want to,
even if they look busted.
I'm here.
 Mm-hmm.
When I started it,
like, I was kind of like,
"Am I an attractive person?"
 I look pretty, and that's--
 [laughs]
And that's it.
 Some people use drag
as an escape.
Like they don't feel
that they--
 Yes, it's true.
 I agree.
'Cause I started so young.
I needed something to boost
my self-esteem, you know?
And people--people finally
told me I was beautiful.
The biggest difficulty for me,
though,
has been, like, people
who you know or knew people
don't know the real you.
They only know your character.
So they start only calling you
by your character name,
or, like, they only want to
see you in drag.
And then if you show up
and you're not in drag,
they're like,
"Oh, where's Shangela tonight?"
 But for Alexis,
that's not a problem.
 [laughs]
 No, I don't--
I don't know if that's true,
because, I mean, RuPaul, like,
you know, half the time here--
 I'm not talking about RuPaul;
I'm talking about me.
 It all starts to become
one person after a while.
 Raja's first picture of her
in drag is an oil painting.
[laughter]
 No, bitch,
it's a cave painting.
 No, it's one of
those pictures
where they have to have
the big flash that explodes
when you take the picture.
 My problem with drag
is the dating scene.
 It is kind of hard.
 My situation that, every time
you're gonna date somebody,
you feel like you just--
 Have to hide it.
 You just have to come
out of the closet.
 Yes.
And then when you're going out
for the night,
and you intend on going out
and hooking up with someone,
you have to make sure
that you put all your drag
up in the closet
and all the sequins
off the floor,
all the rhinestones.
 It is true.
But that was at the beginning.
 Now I don't care.
 Ha!
 [laughs]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle, we're going back
to our roots tonight.
 Aren't we, baby?
 Santino.
Now are you gonna be
splitting hairs
with our girls tonight?
 Oh, you know this.
 Wayne Brady!
I'm so glad you're here.
 Hey, you.
I am so happy to be here.
And Fantasia.
 Ooh!
 Hi, Ru.
 This week, our queens
were challenged
to compete in
a fantasy hair show
and create three
distinct hairstyles,
which includes a runway outfit
made entirely out of hair.
Gentlemen...
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
The first looks are their
classic hairstyles
from a past era-era-uh.
Yara Sofia.
Oh, she's got a disco feeling.
 I'm bringing this '70s look.
With such an inspiration.
And I feel flawless.
 She loves the nightlife.
 Studio 54.
 Alexis Mateo.
Bring the fur, baby.
 [laughing]
 My classic look
is all glamour.
Hollywood.
The golden age.
 The drama.
 Looks like she was outside
trapping some animals too.
 A girl's gotta eat.
 Look at Raja.
Very '60s.
 Ooh!
 Yes, hey!
 Twiggy!
 Yes.
 That girl.
 I just wanted her
to feel really sweet,
a little bit like
a sex-cretary in the '60s.
A little<i> Mad Men.</i>
 Oh, I love a nude pump.
That's Raja from
the secretarial pool.
 Sex in the '60s.
 [laughing]
 Shangela.
Uh-oh, I smell a costume change.
 [laughing]
 I'm a Spanish flamenco sister
all the way from Barcelona.
And I'm loving it.
 Ooh,<i> el motivar.</i>
<i>Toro, toro!</i>
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Ole.
 Oh, and she popped the fan.
 Yes, she popped that fan.
 She popped something.
 Manila.
 She's giving you
Marie Antoinette meets<i> Shaft.</i>
 Yes.
 Blonde Venus.
 Is she "rock me Amadeus"
from the '80s?
 I have a powdered wig going.
I have my little, like,
curls on the side.
And I'm feeling fierce,
and the judges are living.
Oh, look at all the cameos.
 And look at the candelabra
in her hair.
 Oh, yes.
That's a candelabra.
This is their modern
red carpet look.
From Yara Sofia.
Wow.
Desperate housewife.
 There's a little J-Lo
in that one.
 I'm giving the judges
a very strong haircut
like Rihanna, for example.
 I'm going to the Emmys.
 It's very Roberto Cavalli.
 Sexy urban camo.
 Yes, it is.
Alexis Mateo.
She's ready for the ALMA awards.
 For my red carpet
modern look,
I make an evening mohawk.
And it's very modern,
it's very couture.
 A little new school Mae West.
 Yes, she is.
 Yeah, there you go.
She's trying life as a blonde.
 Just a little bit at a time.
 Yeah.
 Raja.
Britt Ekland.
Ooh.
 Okay.
 Easy breezy.
 I cut this hair.
This is something
that I razored on my own.
And I am ruling that runway.
All I can hear in my ears are
electric guitars and keyboards.
 Vidal Sassoon.
Shangela.
Miss Diahann Carroll is
in the house.
 Yes, she is.
 I'm daytime class.
So I'm coming down the runway
giving you Diahann Carroll
at the Oprah's Legends ball.
And I'm feeling fierce.
 Red carpet.
 Oh, she gave you a wedge.
 Yes.
I think she's pumpin'
to bump it.
Manila.
 Audrey Hepburn there.
 Well, she's more
Jennifer Love Hewitt's version
of Audrey Hepburn.
 Yes.
 I'm walking down the runway,
and I feel like Audrey Hepburn
in<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>
or Barbara Streisand.
 She has borrowed those jewels
from Harry Winston.
 Of course.
 The security guard
is backstage.
 Waiting for me.
 This is their fantasy hair
extravaganza.
Yara Sofia.
 Oh!
 Oh!
 Take that, Bjork.
 How much is that poodle
on the runway?
 For the fantasy,
I'm wearing this hairy dress.
It's like a scorpion on the top.
I feel so fabulous.
 I made a purse out
of Shirley Temple.
 Oh, yes.
 Won't get out of place.
 I see her fantasy
is doggy style.
Alexis Mateo.
 Oh!
 Phantom of the drag queens.
 Yes.
 I look like a ballerina
in a circus.
I'm loving it.
It just screams Alexis Mateo
from far away.
 Thighs wide open.
 Yes, hunty.
Wild, wild west.
Miss Kitty never looked so good.
Raja.
Hair fantasy.
 Wow.
 I'm so happy with
what I've created.
It looks like this beautiful,
like, cotton candy
frothy milkshake.
 Earth girls are easy!
 Yes.
Yes, Rainbow Brite.
 She's like a snow cone.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Shangela.
 Ooh!
 Ooh!
 Mad Max.
 Ooh, She-man the barbarian.
 The minute I hit that runway,
I am alien warrior princess,
and I'm coming for you.
 Two queens enter,
one queen leaves.
 [laughing]
 Beyond the merkin-dome.
 Ooh!
I wanna see that in 3-D.
 Mm-hmm.
 Manila.
 What you buzzin' 'bout?
 Yes, honey.
Honeybee.
 I'm feeling cute
and floating around
on the runway, like,
from flower to flower.
 She's pollinating the runway.
 She is.
 Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Welcome, ladies.
Your runway was absolutely
hair-raising.
And now it's time
for the judges' critique.
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
Tell me about
your fantasy extravaganza.
 For me, the word
"extravaganza" means an animal.
 The word "extravaganza"
to you means an animal,
like a scorpion and a poodle.
 Scoodle.
 I made this, um, scorpion,
um, curve.
 Uh-huh.
 And I feel very hairy.
Very hairy.
 [laughing]
Well, girl, you are hairy.
 [raspy groan]
 [laughing]
 It's very Dr. Seuss.
You're like a beautiful woman
from Whoville.
 Don't take this the bad way,
but, like, you're like the ho
of Whoville.
 [laughing]
 A "who-ho."
 A "who-ho."
 Yeah, a "who-ho."
Horton heard a ho.
Who--I love that.
 Right. Right.
 I love that.
 Fantasia, what did you think
of her classic look?
 Um, it reminds me so much of
my aunties.
How, you know,
how they used to do it.
And they used to rock it well.
And I want the outfit.
 Thank you.
 Do you think I can wear
that outfit?
 Yes, I can make a few ones.
 I got a lot of junk
in my trunk.
 Don't worry, darling.
 Okay, good.
 Next up, Alexis Mateo.
Hi, mami.
 Hi, Ru.
Hi, judges.
 Let's start with the best,
which is this look here.
Your fantasy look.
When you came out,
I totally got circus girl.
Your red carpet look that was
supposed to be very modern,
the hair was kind of like
budget RuPaul, in a way.
I mean, it was like, uh,
I don't know what award show
you would have worn that to.
 What I don't understand is,
you do the modern red carpet,
and it looks like you're wearing
the red carpet.
You know, all along I've been
telling you,
I don't understand why certain
things you wear
that makes your body look bigger
and malproportioned.
 But I felt like a star
walking on that runway, so...
I would wear my dress with my
mohawk to my red carpet event.
And I would wear this
for the circus as well.
 [laughing]
 So bam!
[all laughing]
 Up next, Raja.
Hi, Raja.
 Hi.
 What inspired your look?
 The big mission I had
with this
is to make it
not look like hair.
 I love the outfit.
You have beautiful legs.
 They're wooden, by the way.
 [laughing]
I'll take them, I'll take them.
 Thank you, Fantasia.
Now all the way from
the Colombian coffee fields--
 [laughing]
 Let's go to Juan Valdez.
 You look completely, like,
Japanime art.
And as for your red carpet look,
I liked your take on it.
It was definitely like
a young rocker.
Love the hair.
The razor cut.
If I could have one critique,
it's that I think you look
even more beautiful
with less makeup on.
 Your '60s look,
I put that you're like a sexy,
dark Goldie Hawn,
circa<i> Laugh-In.</i>
And you looked really natural
and real,
and that looked like that could
be you walking the streets.
 Next up...
Shangela.
 Hi, Ru.
 Where'd you get
the inspiration
for your fantasy outfit?
 You know,
I love sci-fi films.
I love horror,
scarier films.
 Wait, what did you call me?
 Ooh!
 For the classic look,
I felt the dress
was a little too big.
I just would have loved to have
seen it be a little tighter,
'cause this figure that I'm
seeing right now...
[clicks tongue, imitates sizzle]
Hot.
 Sometimes, just having one
solid look
works better than having kind of
like two mediocre looks,
because after you took
that big coat off,
you still had kind of
a big gunny sack of a dress on
underneath it.
Your modern red carpet look,
it looked more kind of like the
high-class executive secretary.
It just wasn't quite there
to a red carpet event.
 I felt like I was going to,
like, Oprah's Legends ball.
 Montecito.
 That's right.
It was a daytime look.
 Why would you pick a daytime
red carpet?
 I'm an E! fan.
They have carpets all day long.
 Yeah, you could wear that on
the red carpet.
Would E! stop you
to talk to you and ask you,
"Who did your hair?"
No, they'd probably go,
"Eh, she did her hair."
But you appear to be
very fearless
just like your dressed--
you know, when I was a kid,
I was a big fan of D&amp;D,
and you look like a D&amp;D heroine.
 Wait a minute, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens?
 Yes, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens.
 Next up, Manila.
 Hi, Ru.
Hi, judges-zzzzzz.
 Hi, Manila.
 I loved the classic.
I want the dress.
I want the boots.
I loved everything about
the classic look.
 Who wears a tiara
to a red carpet?
 I would.
 Hey, girl.
 Hey!
 We queens, Santino.
 Thank you.
 Get into it.
 [laughing]
I really just felt that, uh,
enormous central necklace
made your beautiful neck
and this whole area just
kind of look a little mannish.
 Okay.
 Thank you, Pancho Villa.
 [laughing]
 So, Manila, I can just
eat you
with a spoon tonight.
And what I love most about you
as a drag queen
is your ability
to theme couture.
Like, you always have these
great themes.
 A love of fashion
and insects,
you don't find that
in a woman.
 No, you don't.
 Good job.
 Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you go and untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starting up]
Okay, kids.
We're gonna start with
Yara Sofia.
She was our scorpion poodle.
 Scoodle.
 She really brought it
to the fantasy level.
 I thought she tore it up.
The '70s look was
out of control.
The hair was gorgeous.
I loved the big gold hoops.
I want that outfit.
 Is it wrong that I think
that the booty is so amazing?
 No.
 It's juicy, honey.
 Yes.
 Yeah, you know, this kinda
messes with
your perception of things.
 It does.
 Oh, my goodness.
 It wrecks your head, honey.
 Now you see what happened to
Eddie Murphy.
 [laughing]
 What?
 Alexis Mateo.
 She looked like she was
coming from
a Bell Biv Devoe video.
 [laughing]
She didn't look like--
she didn't look like
a Hollywood starlet.
 That '40s look, there was
nothing '40s about it.
Maybe $40.
 Oh, okay.
 And that's about it.
 All right.
Do think that her red carpet
look was too regional?
 She wore the red carpet
and spangled it.
 Miss Raja.
all: [laughing]
 I love her.
When she walked out,
it was that look of,
"Even if you don't like it,
"the way I'm about to walk out
here with it,
you're gonna like it."
 Sell the garment.
 I would say, although
she really worked it
and gave us that rock and roll
kind of
first time at the Grammys
kind of young rocker look,
I do wish maybe
she would have brought it
in a more conventional way,
because I would love to see
what Raja
would wear to the Oscars.
 It's probably more realistic
to think that she would
do something
that looks like
a red carpet gown,
instead of going Miley Cyrus.
 Shangela.
 You know what?
She reminds me
so much of myself,
just with being the underdog.
With going into something
and saying,
"You know what?
"I might not have this,
"I might not have that,
but I'm gonna give it my all."
 All of those things
that you said,
Fantasia, I love about her.
And that's really why
she's still here.
 Yes.
 Because as far as her
fashion sense, her style...
she is clueless.
 Is anybody else seeing
the five o'clock shadow
consistently?
 It's not
a five o'clock shadow,
it's actually
the shade of makeup,
and it's her highlighting.
 So it's picking up where--
 She's not blending it
very well; that's what it is.
 I do think that Shangela has
an amazing spirit
and I think may be pursuing
the wrong thing,
because there are clearly
other people
who eat, breathe, sleep this,
and it comes out of their pores.
 Manila.
 Wasn't a big fan
of the fantasy.
Love, love, love the classic.
She had an afro and she had some
curls on the side.
I'm thinking, "Who does that?
And who pulls it off
like she did?"
 As for her red carpet look,
I think she just kind of
overworked the jewelry.
 I don't know, she did it
for me tonight.
 All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
Ladies.
Based on your performance
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Raja.
You served three hot looks.
And your cotton candy fantasy is
truly delicious.
You're safe.
 Thanks.
 Yara Sofia.
This week, you scoodled
your way to victory.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
 [cursing in Spanish]
 [laughing]
 And you've won an Alaskan
cruise for two
from America's number one
gay travel specialist,
alandchuck.travel.
 Do you know what, darling?
It's about time.
It is so good to finally
win a challenge.
 Alexis Mateo.
You are a timeless queen.
But some of your hairstyles were
a little dated
and off the mark.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
 I don't wanna go home.
I wanna stay in this competition
all the way till the end.
 Manila.
You rocked
three very different looks.
And your fantasy bee was killer.
You're safe, honey.
Shangela.
You are a sharp queen.
But I'm afraid your hairstyles
didn't make the cut.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
 Wow, I'm back here...again.
And, you know, it's really tough
having to lip-synch against
a friend in this competition.
 Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves...
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
Good luck.
And don't...
fuck it up.
 The lip-synch is a beautiful
song by Fantasia.
Shangela is doing
the best she can,
but Alexis is, like,
feeling it with her body,
and it's timeless and beautiful.
[applause]
 Yes!
 Yes.
 Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shante, you stay.
 [whispers] Thank you.
 Shangela.
No one can say you didn't
try your hardest.
And it's that drive
that will take you far.
Live your dreams, mama.
Now, sashay away.
 Thank you all.
Thank you.
[applause]
 Halleloo!
 Halleloo!
It's a sad feeling because
I definitely came back
into this competition
wanting to win.
And it's not been easy.
But I'm leaving a winner.
And it's just a lesson
for everyone
who's ever wanted to pursue
any dream they've had.
Live your passion.
And live it to the fullest.
Halleloo!
 Well, ladies.
As you know, each week
I consult with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
It seems that I've been
criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle.
 Yes?
 I want you to confer
with Santino and Billy B.
to decide which of
the eliminated queens...
deserve to return
to this competition...
next week.
 Oh, my God.
Are you freaking kidding me?
 And you may pick from
any of the queens
eliminated this season.
Will it be...
Venus D-Lite?
Phoenix?
Mimi Imfurst?
India Ferrah?
Mariah?
Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews?
Delta Work?
Carmen Carrera?
Or Shangela Laquifa Wadley?
Now.
Remember...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen!
 All right!
Now let the music play!

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
It's time to get totally
leotarded!
- Sha! Sha!
[speaking Spanish]
- Stretch...
- [exhaling rhythmically]
- Alexis, you are the winner.
Stacy, we feel
you are holding back.
But you're safe for now.
- I'll bring it.
- Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me.
- Bitch, step it up.
You gotta make sure
that you're always
the one that's in front.
- Mimi Imfurst.
Drag is not a contact sport.
India Ferrah, shantay, you stay.
- Whoo!
<i>- And tonight...</i>
<i>Escandalo!</i>
The dolls hit the red carpet.
- Ohh! Ha ha!
- And things get steamy.
- Oh! Ohh!
- With extra-special
guest judges
Chloe Sevigny
and Debbie Matenopoulos.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of Kryolan Professional makeup;
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[car engines racing]
- Another day.
- Good morning.
- Life is too short to lift
someone else.
- Girl, y'all gonna lift me.
[laughter]
- Being in the bottom two,
it's a very serious thing.
It kind of like lit a light bulb
in my head.
I have to, like, fight harder
now, so...
- Speaking of fighting.
[laughs]
When Mimi lifted you up,
I was like,
y'all didn't have to grab me.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you know I was ready
to come out there.
I was coming out in my ponytail
and everything.
- I know everyone expected me
to, like,
punch her or something,
when she did that.
No, I'm not a violent person.
I just gotta go on,
focus on the competition
and what I have to do.
- Oh, so now you competin'.
- Now I'm gonna kick you--
- Oh, so now I gotta go home.
Alliances in this competition
are very important.
India is someone that
I can share some tea with
and not think it's gonna
come back around to me
from another mouth.
- Girl, I'm just, you know,
hoping I can wear something that
I don't have to wear
my breast plate with.
- And that we don't have to sew.
- Thank god I don't have big
flower patterns anymore.
- Listen,
be strong in your opinions.
Say you don't have another
chance,
so you better bring it
every time you get out there.
- They wanna see who I am.
Miss Visage said she didn't know
if I'm a bitch,
if I'm a sweetheart.
- She doesn't know
your personality.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is your personality?
Do I need to know?
[laughs]
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Today's drag queen on the go
needs to stay abreast
of current events,
whether she tweets, blogs,
or just talks smack
behind some t-girl's back.
Remember, an informed queen
is a winning queen,
and that's the way it is.
Good night, and good tuck.
[laughing]
[all groan]
Hello, hello, hello.
[all cheer]
To make it today, young stars
have to be in control
of their public image.
For this week's mini-challenge,
you need to create
a quick drag look
for an outrageous photo op
on the red carpet.
You have ten minutes
to pull it together
before the photographers from
Polite in Public arrive.
The two queens that create
the most sensational
paparazzi photo
will win this mini-challenge.
Ready, set...
<i>Escandalo!</i>
[laughing]
- Drag, girls!
- Ooh, scandal!
- The first thing I think about
is, like, the crotch shot.
In order to create a fake vag,
it's all about the way that you
tuck and fold your skin.
I noticed Shangela was kind of
doing something similar.
I could put on a pair of
pantyhose and put on some fuzz,
you know, but this is,
like, real.
It's like a double take.
- All right, here we go.
- Oh!
- You're gonna get
three pictures.
- Okay.
- Make them count.
Are you ready?
- Yes!
- Okay, one, two, three.
Doggie-style.
All right.
Yes.
- I'm just so pandalicious.
- Oh, you're a panda!
- Oh, wow.
That's a Carrera
I'd like to drive.
- So is it okay that my face
is not gonna be in the frame?
I mean, 'cause it's about here.
- Yeah, whatever you wanna do.
And I appreciate you sharing
your inner dialogue,
but we're gonna take that
picture right now.
- Okay.
- One, two, three!
Girl, you put the junk
in junket.
- India Ferrah is here.
Yes, Miss Jackson
if you're nasty,
you better
put that nipple away.
Scandal!
Yes, take that, Harvey Levin.
Wow, look at the size
of that rock.
And that ring's not bad, either.
Ooh, that was scandalous.
- Kind of basing this off
real life, a little bit.
- You have a similar story?
- We won't--
we'll talk about it later.
- Fantastic.
- Hey, Shakira.
<i>Uno, dos, tres!</i>
<i>Escandalo.</i>
The red bow tie really dresses
that outfit up.
Something tells me your tuck's
gonna come undone.
- Let's just make sure that
doesn't happen.
We need a plug.
[laughter]
- Oh, my goodness.
Did you forget something?
- Yes, my bra.
- [laughing]
- Yabba dabba don't.
Oh, girl.
- Can we like--bloob is out?
- Yes, I love it. I love it.
Fantastic.
Nobody said you can't do that.
[southern accent]
One, two, three.
It's nipple-gate!
- Ohh!
- [laughing]
- I'm giving him hairy coochie
and toilet tissue shoe.
You don't think you would
double-click?
Aah!
- Now, I reviewed
your scandalous photos,
and I'm proud to say
you all are whores!
[laughter]
Now, news travels fast.
So to see which two queens
have hit the blogs,
let's go to the WOW Report.
Carmen Carrera
is one of our winners.
- Oh, my god.
[laughing]
I look crazy.
- For the next winner,
let's go to newnownext.com.
[all whoop]
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Oh, my god, you know,
finally my fat ass
has won something.
So these bitches better
watch the fuck out.
- Condragulations.
You are the queens
of morning television.
all: Ooh.
- For today's main challenge,
you'll split into two teams
to broadcast
a morning news show.
Each team consists of
two co-anchors,
a weather girl, a gossip gal,
and a roving reporter,
who'll be interviewing
celebrity guest
Kristin Cavallari.
all: Ohh.
- Carmen and Stacy,
you are our team captains.
Stacy, you get to pick first.
- I just hope Stacy
don't pick me.
Because that team is going to
crash and burn.
- Alexis.
- Manila.
- Ooh!
- Shangela.
- Ooh.
- Mm, Raja.
- Come on, girl, that's it.
- Yara Sofia.
- Delta Work.
- India and Mariah are
the two girls left standing.
- Mariah Carey.
- Me?
- Is she here?
- India Ferrah,
you are on Carmen's team.
- I end up with India.
She was in the bottom
last challenge,
and I don't want to
have to baby anybody.
- These are your news teams.
You will broadcasting live.
- What?
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best newswoman win.
- I would like to be...glossy.
Just serious but funny
at the same time.
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?
- Are we gonna take this, like,
more on a serious note?
- I don't know--what,
you're the team leader.
You tell me.
Is it gonna be like fun-serious
or fun, like spoof?
- We gonna have to figure out
this as a team.
Right now,
Stacy is actually clueless.
- I'm gonna be
the gossip reporter,
because I love to
fuckin' gossip.
- News anchor one
is gonna be Raja.
News anchor two
is going to be...
Delta.
Who wants to do weather girl?
No one wants to be weather girl.
But I don't really see it
for India to be interviewer,
because India can get boring
sometimes.
You're gonna be
the roving reporter.
- Okay, work.
I'll do the interview.
- Weather girl
is gonna be India.
- So I end up with weather girl,
and, honestly, I'm hating it.
But what kind of weather girl?
What should I wear?
- Let's just do a quickie,
just so we get used to it.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I'm Raja Fantaja.
- I'm Carmen Carrera,
and I've got all the tea
in my kiki report.
- Weather girl.
- Oh, is it me now?
- I'm worried for India
a little bit.
- Hey, uh, does anyone know
how much time we have?
- We have like
an hour and a half or so.
- Our main challenge
is to split into two teams
and create a morning news show.
- Remember this?
- Oh, with a bow on it.
- Yeah, this is
my newscaster look.
- Yeah, mine's kind of
muted too,
so that'll look good.
Delta and I have
a great dynamic together
and a chemistry.
So we knew that the banter
was going to be great.
- So what do you think?
What do you got?
- Yeah, I have no clue.
- I've got this.
It's a little skirt and jacket.
- Oh, yeah, that'll work.
Right?
- Is that, like, too bright?
- No, we're drag queens, honey.
- I feel that India
is a little bit
more concerned about her outfit
rather than her character
and knowing her lines.
Last time
she didn't do so good,
so it's like now I want her
to really prove herself.
I really want her to do well.
- I-I don't understand this one.
Like, just how nippy--
can you say this for me?
- Nippy, it's like cold.
- No, I know, I know.
But it's--
- It's getting a bit nippy
out there.
- I asked Stacy if
I could be the weather girl.
Even though speaking English
is kind of difficult.
- Hell, no, storm brewing
deep in the heart of Texas.
- Um, um, Shangela, could you...
- I can say it in Spanish.
- I'm listening to Yara
actually deliver her lines,
and I'm getting a little
worried, you know.
I picked this bitch
for a reason.
She better deliver.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi.
- So, Carmen,
you're a team captain again.
- Yeah.
- So what roles did you assign?
- Well, I'm gonna be
the gossip girl.
- Okay.
- We're gonna have Manila
interview.
- What is your interview style?
- I'm kind of channeling, like,
the best queens of interview.
- Like who?
- Like Mario Lopez
or Ryan Seacrest.
- Ah, okay, I love it.
[laughter]
- Raja is anchor one.
- Have you ever done
any anchoring before?
Any teleprompter?
- No, but I've pretended
quite a bit when I'm alone.
[laughter]
- And then we have Delta's
anch--uh, anchor two.
- From the desert to the sea,
to wherever there's tea.
- [laughing]
Is that your tagline?
- That's our tagline.
- I love it!
That's perfect.
- [singsong]
Bo-ring.
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, we're gonna have India
as the weather girl.
That may be the hardest part.
- Yes, it might be.
But, you know, I'm kind of going
with a little ghetto twist.
- Uh-huh.
- You know,
because you gotta be like,
"Girl, you know, it's gettin'
sunny outside, so..."
- That's you being ghetto?
- Yeah.
- [laughing] Oh, that's...
Well, I can't wait.
I know you all
have a lot of work to do,
a lot of makeup to put on.
I'm gonna let you get to work.
- The opening, the opening.
I love the opening.
- Okay.
- Well, hello,
team Stacy Layne Matthews.
all: Hi.
- How's it going?
- It's going great, honey.
- So who's who?
- Yara is our, um, weather girl.
- Okay.
- You know miss Shangela,
honey, she's our own
gossip columnist.
- Okay.
- This is my sidekick,
reporter number two.
And this is our roving reporter.
- How are you faring
as a team leader?
- I think I'm doing good, and,
you know, we all just organizing
things, you know, and it's--
- You said we all organizing.
You're organizing,
or we all organizing?
- We're working as a group.
- So now, you've made yourself
one of the anchors, right?
- Yes.
- You got some criticism
from the judge panel
that you weren't, you know,
you're not really the most
outrageous person on the planet.
- I can be.
- I'm...we wanna see that.
- Being from a small town,
it just sets me apart
from the other competition,
because I'm a little rough
around the edges.
I'm not as polished
as the other girls,
but, you know, I represent.
- Now, Yara, you're gonna be
working on a green screen.
Practice with me.
If the map of the United States
was behind you,
where is Florida?
- Florida's right here.
- Yeah.
Where's Maine?
- Maine?
- Maine.
- Where is Maine?
- Uh, now, where's New York?
- Um, right there.
- Yes.
And where's the North Pole?
- Ah, over there.
[laughter]
- Now, Alexis, you're gonna be
reading off of a teleprompter.
Do you feel comfortable
with that?
- I just gonna hope
that I do very well.
This is gonna be
a learning experience.
- Now, Mariah, you're gonna be
the roving reporter.
- Yes, I get to interview
Kristin.
I'm going to first start out
with where she's from.
Touch base on, you know,
her achievements
on film and television,
and then I also
want to touch base
on some of her charitable works.
- How much time do you have?
- Three minutes.
- Three minutes
is not a lot of time.
- I have an outline,
and I have base points
to touch on,
and I'm gonna get to
every single one of those,
and they lead to
the next question.
- Right, this is really about
your own personality.
That's really
what we want to see.
Ladies, to help you get your
charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
ready for morning television,
you'll be receiving
a crash course in media training
by veteran broadcaster
Debbie Matenopoulos.
[all gasp]
You know her from<i> The View.</i>
- Bitch, we find out
that miss Debbie,
honey, from<i> The View</i>
is gonna be giving us feedback
about our performances.
I mean, this shit is, like,
serious and exciting, honey.
And I cannot wait to hear
what this bitch has got to say.
- All right, news flash:
Don't fuck it up.
- Okay.
- I'll see you all later.
All right.
all: Thank you.
- Thanks for the tip.
[upbeat music]
- Team Stacy Layne Matthews
has entered the news room.
Say hello to
Debbie Matenopoulos.
all: Hi, Debbie, how are you?
- Hi, you gorgeous creatures.
- Now, Debbie's here
to walk you through
some of the technical aspects
of being in a news room.
And then we are going
all the way live.
Three, two, one.
- This just in:
Scientists have announced a cure
for hetosexural--
heterosexuality.
I've never, you know,
been in front of a teleprompter.
Slow that shit down.
I got to read.
- Side effects include diarrhea,
sudden baldness,
and an uncro--
uncontrollable urge
to dress age inappropriately.
- Wow, that's a great discovery,
girl.
- Yes, honey.
- Yes.
- You two are the main anchors.
You have to set the tone.
So at the top of a show,
be up, up, up.
- Hey, Yara Sofia,
how are things looking
out there today?
- Down here, there is a--
hurricane carnage.
Oh!
It's just right there.
There's a barometric dropping.
Oh! Ohh!
Almost burned my ass.
Oh, my god.
- Girl!
You forced me to believe
everything you said,
although I didn't
understand a word.
Slow down<i> or</i><span style="bodyStyle"> don't even speak</i>
a word of English.
- Now
it's Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- Now, listen, the next
drag superstar wannabes
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews
were the talk of the town
after creating a huge scene
last night on the red carpet.
Honey, it was<i> escandalo!</i>
Yara Sofia,<i> escandalo?</i>
Honey chile, yes.
That's right.
- You were giving me
the attitude
that you knew exactly
what you were doing.
You were sailing the ship.
I could take a note
or two from you.
- I'm here with
Kristin Cavallari.
So...so...
all the scandal.
Around the town
with Justin Brody,
and you have Shawn--
- Justin Bobby.
- Justin Bobby.
But you've been spotted
with Nick as well.
- Who?
- Uh, Corzone.
Am I saying his name wrong?
- Nick Carzone.
- I had some facts that I didn't
have completely together.
- There are times where I have
had my facts completely wrong.
And it's okay,
as long as you can recover.
- Okay.
- Oh, my god, look at the time.
We're almost on the air!
places, people!
Places!
- It's time to go live,
and I was so scared
about my English.
And how I can deliver
my personality.
- Count it down in three, two...
- Live from the QNN news center,
Stacy Layne Matthews...
Alexis Mateo...
Yara Sofia...
Shangela Laquifa Wadley...
and Mariah.
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I'm Stacy Matthews.
Just in, scientists
have announced a cure
for heterosexuality.
- I am so glad that pill
just came out.
- Yes, girl.
- We're suffering
here in United States.
- Honey.
- It's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather.
- What's going on?
Ohh!
It is raining men down there!
[speaking Spanish]
Okay! Rainbow right here!
Oh, my god, that's so gay.
But it's so good.
That's a wrap on the weather,
I'm Yara Sofia.
- Let me just say, I do think
"It's so good, but it's so gay"
is my new favorite phrase.
I love that, Yara.
Listen, honey, let me tell you.
Which A-list action hunk
is finally
coming out of the closet?
I'll just tell you this:
He's so gay, and he's so good.
Listen, it's
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
and that's your daily
kiki report.
Back to you, Stacy and Alexis.
- Mariah, over to you, honey.
- Hi, ladies.
Good morning.
I'm here, Mariah,
with Kristin Cavallari.
So are you working
on any new projects?
- I'm working on
a shoe line right now,
which I'm really excited about.
- Oh, perfect.
I'm excited about that too.
So, were you really born
a genetic woman?
- [laughs]
I was, yes.
- Oh, darn, girls.
We can't claim her for our team.
So, back to you
in the news room, QNN.
- Well, that's all
for the Morning After News.
Stay tuned for the same news,
different anchors.
- All right, that's a wrap.
- Welcome, team Carmen!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
It's time for the morning news!
- Pour yourself
another cup of ambition,
because this is
the Morning After News.
- Today's breaking story:
We'll have the latest on
that horrific freak accident
that killed so many innocent
little people last night.
- Loosen up some.
You two are the anchors,
and you have to drive the ship,
but you also wanna be likable.
- It's Carmen Carrera.
- Next drag superstar wannabes
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews
were the talk of the town
after creating a huge scene
on the red carpet last night.
I didn't even know I was there!
- Performance is a little bit
flat.
- In Provincetown...
Massachusetts...
I'm like, "Girl, just like,
pictures what, like,
Al Roker would do."
There is the barometric
pressure.
It's dropping.
- The weather people
are the personality.
They have carte blanche to be,
"Girl!"
I'm still waiting for your
personality to come through.
India, this is the time.
- Manila, over to you.
- [Asian accent]
Thank you, Delta.
So...Kristin...
you were on two hit TV show!
Tell us, how has that
changed your life?
- It just made me move
up to L.A. and pursue acting.
- What year you born?
- Uh, '87.
- Oh! Me too.
You are the cock.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Rooster, rooster.
- [laughing]
- When you weren't pronouncing
your Ls and your Rs,
I thought
it was a terrible decision.
But, you know what?
That never hurt Barbara Walters.
It's time for the morning news.
We are going live.
- I'm very nervous
before the broadcast,
because this team
is depending on me to do good.
So I'm just like, "Ugh."
- I'm gonna count it down...
in three, two, one.
- Live from the QNN news center,
Raja...
Delta Work...
India Ferrah...
Carmen Carrera...
and Manila Luzon.
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I am Raja.
- And I'm Delta Work.
- Lookin' sexy.
- So do you.
I love you in pink.
- Thanks.
- [gasps]
- Now let's go to the gal
with all the gossip,
it's Carmen Carrera.
- Ugh, I have so much tea
for you.
Which A-list action hunk
is finally
coming out of the closet?
Well, let's just say
he was at my house last night.
both: Ooh!
- Well, it's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather girl.
Hey, India, how are things
looking out there today?
- Now...deep in the heart
of Texas, y'all--
y'all feelin' me?
There is a hell no storm.
Okay?
In the heartland,
a rainbow has appeared
in the Gayville
of South Dakota.
This is India Ferrah
with Drag-U-weather.
Back to you, Raja and Delta.
- Thanks, weather grr.
Manila, over to you.
- [Asian accent]
Kristin!
Now that the final episode
of<i> The Hills</i><span style="bodyStyle"> has aired,</i>
what's next?
- Right now,
I'm really focusing
on my shoe line
that I'm designing.
- Oh, shoes.
I love shoes.
- I think every girl
loves shoes.
- You don't have boyfriend?
- I don't, I'm single.
- Ooh, I have brother.
You should hook up with him.
You should marry.
Immigration.
Lots of money.
- [laughing]
- Back to you in the studio,
Raja and Delta.
- From the desert to the sea
to wherever there's tea,
I'm Delta Work.
We hope the rest of your day
is a big ol' drag.
- Ladies, your newscasts
will be played for the judges
tomorrow night
on the main stage,
where we will be joined
by our guest judge,
Academy-Award-nominated actress,
from HBO's<i> Big Love,</i>
Chloe Sevigny.
[all gasp]
- I love Chloe.
Not only is she
an amazing actress,
but she's a fashion icon
at this point.
- So come decked out in your
most fabulous drag looks.
On behalf
of Debbie Matenopoulos,
I'm RuPaul,
and we'll see you tomorrow.
- Can I come in?
- No.
- We're back
in the workroom today,
and we have to put together
our fiercest drag look.
- How do you think our team did?
- I think our team is great.
I think we're not gonna
have a problem with that.
- I'm a little nervous.
I mean, if our news piece comes
out really shitty,
it's gonna be on me.
- I feel confident that we all,
on our team, did a good job.
- Change the subject.
I don't want to talk about this
anymore.
[laughter]
- India.
- What's up?
What went down on y'all's team
yesterday?
Everything went good
except for
the run-through with me
with the weather girl.
- Who else was on your team?
- Carmen.
- She's your team captain,
though, right?
Well, if you want to call it
that.
I'm just calling it like it is.
Carmen's only strategy was just
for her to pick her part.
I think she should be more like,
"Bitch, we need to win
this challenge.
Like, let's practice.
Let's get our roles down."
But you know, she just went on
about her business.
Bitch, I got stuck
with the weather girl.
Looking, trying
to read cue cards,
pushing this button,
trying to point at the map.
My performance yesterday
was horrible, you know.
I feel like I'm gonna be in
the bottom two again, honestly.
Like, I don't think
I stepped up my game,
and I'll see what happens.
Never again, bitch.
I'm not cut out
to be weather girl.
- For today's
runway presentation,
we actually have to bring
our most fabulous
drag-tastic outfits.
I need to get to my glue gun.
Ugh!
I have so much to do.
I do not want to be the one
lipsynching for my life.
Okay--Stacy.
- I actually overheard her
saying that I fucked it up.
- Do you think you did good
in this challenge?
- I think I did all right.
Let's be honest.
I fucked it up.
I did.
I'm very nervous that I'm
going to be in the bottom two
and have to lip-synch
for my life
and probably go home.
- My home girl, Miss Stacy.
Now, you know we're two
country girls.
But Alexis and I were both
engaged in pageant life,
and more so than pageants,
we're performers.
Would you ever compete
in a pageant, Raja?
- It's not my thing.
My name is Raja, so--
I can't do that.
I'm way too rock and roll.
- First thing
out of her mouth was,
"I don't do all that
'do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.'"
That's a stereotype.
- We don't smile
like Miss America.
Like, it's all about personality
and what you--who you are.
- The whole pageant thing
is really new to me.
We don't have that
in California.
- We do.
I'm the current California
Entertainer of the Year.
- Shangela is California
Miss EOY, honey,
and she is really passionate
about that.
She definitely let us all know.
- I've been in California
working it longer than you have.
- I adore Shangela,
but when I see
that little glimpse of,
like, entitlement, when you've
only been doing drag for...
minutes,
I don't think it's cool.
I think you have to be
an artist.
- It sounds to me
like you're saying
that people
who compete in pageants
aren't performance artists.
- Oh, stop it, Shangela.
I didn't say that.
- I'm listening.
- How is it your art form
if you're doing the art
under somebody else's rules?
- Thank you.
- You can defend her
'cause it's your best friend.
- I'm defending her
because she's right.
Shangela decided that
when you start talking
about a pageant,
you're attacking her.
- Girl, it's like
the<i> West Side Story.</i>
Bitches is like, "Ha, ha, ha!"
- It's not part of
our drag culture, though.
I think this is
a really new thing.
- Well, then y'all
defeated yourself already.
- No, I don't want to be
in a pageant.
No, but what if--
- Wait, time out.
Yeah, you're right, Raja.
- That's the performance
I wanted to do, what if--
- You're getting real
confrontational with me,
but I'm just saying other people
could do unique forms of art,
and they could also win.
- That was kind of heated.
- [laughing]
[upbeat music]
- Hi, gorgeous lady.
- Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle.
How you doing?
- Good, gorgeous.
How are you?
- I'm doing wonderful.
It's gonna be a great show.
Makeup superstar Billy B
is here.
Hi, Billy.
- Hey, Ru.
- Debbie Matenopoulos.
- Hey, girl.
- Chloe Sevigny.
Hey, Scorpio sister.
- Hello.
- I'm feeling very Scorpio
tonight.
- Good.
I'm a double Scorpio.
So watch out.
[laughter]
- Now, for this week's
challenge,
our queens went live,
serving up morning newscast
realness.
Are you ready to take a little
time to enjoy this view?
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
First up, Delta Work.
[all gasp]
- Look out, Darryl Hannah.
She's makin' a splash.
- I think today
I'm just channeling,
like, Mae West or something.
Like, maybe it's like
Sally Kirkland,
like that, on the red carpet.
- We found Nemo.
- Yes!
Up next, Shangela.
Donatella would approve.
- As I'm coming down the runway,
I feel "wind" with me.
It's like that Beyoncé feel,
where everywhere you go
you've got wind.
- Sell the garment.
- Go 'head, go 'head, girl.
- Fly, butterfly.
Carmen Carrera.
What could she be reading about?
- I handmade that whole thing.
So I'm just hoping
nothing falls off.
There's no strap to my top,
so if that comes off,
then it's like you guys
are gonna see my titties.
- Who says the newspaper
industry is dead?
Mariah.
- She wore blue velvet.
- Feel like
I have a fabulous look.
It's clean, it's elegant.
- I love that gown.
- I'm getting Vanessa Williams
from this too.
- Oh, yes.
- Alexis Mateo.
Wow!
- Cha-cha.
- I'm just giving RuPaul
a lot of personality,
and being very cha-cha,
very Latina.
- Turn the--
- Charo!
- Go ahead, Charo.
- All we need is a trapeze.
- Ohh! Whoo!
Ooh.
- India Ferrah.
This is her more tasteful
sister.
I'm giving a little glamorous
India, you know?
Kind of old Hollywood.
I don't have my breastplate on,
because, you know,
I'm showing them
a versatile side of me.
- She's a lady.
- She's giving
a little bit of Ginger
from<i> Gilligan's island.</i>
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
all: Wow.
- It's very<i> Mad Max.</i>
- I'm in this lovely dress, and
the first thing I think about
is, "Smile, bitch."
They're really enjoying it,
because they haven't seen
this side of me before.
- I feel like she has
a puppy on her head.
- Is that a puppy on her head?
- Manila Luzon.
all: Ohh!
- Is that a bomb?
Everybody down!
- I'm just swaying my hips
and smiling
and showing off my purse
and having a gay old time.
- Did you, Tina Knowles,
a real pineapple?
- Honey, it's a T.K.O.
- You better work.
- Tina Knowles original.
- Yara Sofia!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Qu'est que c'est?
- Something wicked
this way comes.
- I'm bringing hairy horns,
the cape, and I take it off.
- [gasps]
Look at the body.
- She says, "Carmen Carrera,
you're not the only one."
- Yes.
- Hunty.
- Drive this.
Last but not least, Raja.
all: Ohh...
- It's fashion week.
- There's your Westwood,
right there.
- I'm really, really inspired
by things rococo
and Marie Antoinette.
All things sort of French.
- Let them eat cake!
- Anna Wintour will run that
in the spring issue.
- Gaultier,
remember who did that?
- We've got our cover.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
- Ladies,
I asked you to dazzle us,
and dazzle you did.
After this week's
main challenge,
morning television
will never be the same.
You hear that, Kathie Lee?
Earlier, the judges screened
your full live newscasts.
Now, ladies, I have
a little news for you.
Alexis Mateo,
you have immunity this week.
Raja, Yara Sofia,
Carmen Carrera, Delta Work.
You're all safe.
You may leave the stage.
- Thank you.
- Ladies, the five of you
represent the best and the worst
of this week.
It's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Manila.
- As over-the-top
as the performance was,
I really enjoyed it.
- Kristin Cavallari,
my brother, ho fun.
- I literally cried.
I mean, I thought that it was
brilliant on so many levels.
- Manila was a star tonight.
- Thank you.
- With that type of thing,
it cannot be half-assed.
And you went completely there,
did not break character.
It was fantastic.
But as far as the look goes,
it's absolutely flawless.
- It was so wrong...
that it was so right.
And truthfully, if you're
gonna be groundbreaking,
some eggs have gotta be broken
to make an omelet.
- If someone watching tonight
were offended by what you did,
how would you answer to that?
- I don't think we have enough
Asian people in pop culture.
So I'm here to entertain.
I'm here to be farcical.
And just trying to do my job.
- All right, next up, Shangela.
- The accessories
might have been
a little over-the-top
for my taste.
Maybe one of the bracelets
would have worked better.
- I think that it could be
a little bit less eye makeup.
- I loved this look tonight
for you.
I thought it was very pretty,
very sassy.
Not so much stuff lighting up
and lanterns
and this, that,
and the other thing.
You know, gossip on the radio
is my thing,
and you served it.
You did a great, great job.
- You could tomorrow
go to any local show
in this market in los Angeles
and say, "I wanna do your
entertainment news on a Friday;
take a shot on me,"
and I think they'd have
a hard time telling you no.
- What I saw in that broadcast
is what--the potential I saw
in your audition.
And I'm very proud of you, mama.
India Ferrah.
What was it like broadcasting
live as our weather girl?
- I had so much confusion
going on.
I didn't know where to go.
Cue cards were on the sides.
Like, I was lost, definitely.
- When India came out, I was
very impressed with her grace
and posture.
But the dress not so much.
- It was you reciting
what they told you to say.
And I think it did fall flat.
- What I wanted to see
was more of you.
- I wanna know what's keeping
you from bustin' out?
- Honestly, I don't know.
I don't know
if it's nervousness...
- I don't know what to tell you,
but the time to jump on it
is yesterday.
Next up,
the queen we call Mariah.
- I think she's stunning.
I mean, absolutely beautiful.
I think if I saw you, I'd think
you were a real woman.
I mean, you could give Naomi
a run for her money,
you know, on any catwalk.
- But Naomi would probably
throw a phone at her.
- I would catch it
and throw it back.
- Thank you.
- When the interviewing process
started,
I was getting
a little concerned,
and then it turned
for the better.
- So you're better known
for<i> The Hills.</i>
- Mm-hmm.
- But you're becoming
quite the man-eater.
- Mariah, you are what we call
a grower, not a shower.
When the interviewing process
started,
I was getting
a little concerned,
and then it turned
for the better.
But I thought
you looked stunning.
- I agree with
what Michelle said.
However, they don't give you
a second shot.
Three, two, one,
the camera's on--
it's sink or swim, right now,
'cause nobody cares--it's live.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- When she first came out,
I thought maybe she had a little
Yorkie on her head.
The hair was very confusing
to me.
- So, now, Chloe, are you saying
you're a Yorkie lover?
Is that what you're saying?
- I actually don't like animals.
[laughter]
- I love the way you look.
Know what I loved most of all?
Your smile, honey.
You lit up tonight.
- On the broadcast,
you did put a lot of thought
into it.
Almost too much.
You got so into
trying so hard
to memorize and memorize
that you forgot to be you.
- There seems to be something
blocking you
from completely blooming
in this competition.
- After thinking everything over
last night,
I feel like I lifted something
from myself.
And I'm ready to work.
I'm ready to show you
who Stacy is.
- Well, you said that last week,
Stacy.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
gar-girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Manila.
- The makeup to me
was a little heavy.
- Yes, the makeup was heavy,
but I don't know.
There's just something
about Manila tonight
that was a win-win situation
for me.
- I love Manila,
because I agree she's fearless,
and she's an equal opportunity
offender.
That doesn't mean you're racist.
You hate everybody,
including your own race.
Then it's funny.
- 'Cause if you can't
hate yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
hate anybody else?
- I say it all the time.
- All right, up next...
Shangela.
This is a tough one, 'cause she
did a really good job too.
- She impressed me, you know,
in all aspects.
And I think her personality
really showed through.
- I wasn't 100% sold
on the dress this evening,
but I loved the character.
She did a great job with it.
- Her personality
jumped through the television
and just tugged at your heart.
I just--I really--I wanted to go
have lunch with her.
- India Ferrah.
- It was hard to watch.
- It was hard to watch.
- Yeah. I feel for the girl,
but I wasn't impressed.
- She has the gift of us telling
her exactly what to do.
And she's still not doing it.
- Good point.
- I thought the dress
was horrible.
I thought the performance
was horrible.
I thought the makeup
was horrible.
This is $75,000
and a huge title.
- Yes, absolutely.
Mariah.
Listen, I gotta admit,
her performances do leave me
a little flat.
- She looked like
a professional journalist,
but acted like it was
a school project in ATL.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Every time she gets up here,
she's saying, "I'm gonna start
bein' me tomorrow!"
Chloe, do you believe her?
- Not if she keeps saying it.
- And she keeps saying it.
- Watching the newscaster,
I did not see anything
spectacular brought to it.
Did not see a character.
- Maybe that's her idea
of how bland newscasters are.
- It could be.
- And how boring a job
that would be.
Because she did look like a
woman walking at the mall.
- She looked like just a lady
on the number 110 bus uptown,
to me.
- The first thing I thought was,
"That looks like the newscaster
in Tupelo, Mississippi."
- It's true.
- All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
- Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your live
morning newscast
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Manila Luzon.
This week,
you broke all the rules.
You crossed the line
of good taste.
And you perpetuated stereotypes.
Congratulations,
you're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Not only are you safe
from next week's elimination,
but you also win a $2,000
gift certificate from Wig USA.
- I'm really excited
that I won this challenge.
I'm proud of myself.
- Shangela,
keep up the good work.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- India Ferrah...
as Khloe Kardashian once said,
"You can lead a horse to water,
but a pencil must be lead."
India, I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.
- I am disappointed that I'm
in the bottom two again.
But, you know,
I came here to do a job,
and that was to prove to
everyone that told me
that I couldn't do it
that I can do it.
- Mariah, listen to me, girl.
You are resting on pretty.
And while you rest,
the other girls are gonna
race right past you.
You're safe.
- [whispering]
Thank you.
Good luck.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Your brilliance
comes in flashes,
but those moments
are too few and far between.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I do not want to go home.
There ain't shit
in North Carolina
but cornfields, honey.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself...
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lipsync...
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- I had this mentality,
you know,
just be fierce, be a bitch,
give attitude.
Give everything that they need
to keep me in this competition.
- I've worked so hard
to get here.
The only thing standing
between me and the finish line
is Stacy Layne Matthews,
and I've gotta
take this bitch down.
- Don't slap me.
- [laughing]
- 'Cause I'm not in the mood.
- [laughing]
[applause]
- Ladies...
that was a close one.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- India Ferrah,
your time at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
has reached its climax.
But your legendary journey
has just begun.
Now...sashay...away.
- Thank you all.
- Thank you.
[applause]
- I'm definitely disappointed.
Apparently, I'm not
what the judges want.
I'm not comedy.
I'm not camp.
So I'm me, and I'm not gonna
change myself
to fit someone else's standards.
I can't reach it.
[grunting]
Yeah, anyway...
mwah!
- Condragulations, ladies.
I see a lot of incredible talent
on this stage.
But America's next
drag superstar
has yet to emerge.
Remember...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play!
- Yeah.
- RuPaul's menswear provided by
Moods of Norway.
Grand prize contributed in part
by AlandChuck.travel.


<i>- Previously on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...
I want you to meet some real
athletes.
- Come on in, babies!
Come on in!
Whoo!
both: Divas, divas, here we go!
Safe sex is the way to go!
- Keep your pecker clean, man!
- Have a rubber catch
that semen!
both: Protection is the key!
both: No, no, no bareback.
both: Safe sex. Whoo!
<i>- Manila, you served up</i>
<i>two china dolls.</i>
Condragulations.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
- Yah!
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Raja...
Shante, you stay.
- [sobs]
- Carmen Carrera,
baby, you don't make it easy
to say good-bye.
Now, sashay away.
[laughs]
<i>And tonight the dolls hit</i>
<i>the jackpot...</i>
- What?
- And go for broke.
It is time for the most
expensive challenge in<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> her-story.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest</i>
<i>judges La Toya Jackson</i>

- Top four again!
- Yoo-hoo!
- Déjà vu.
Carmen left the competition.
I love Carmen, but, darling,
at this point, it's you or me.
Oh, there's a message.
- Good-bye again.
Best of luck to everyone.
Turn it out and don't be
a sprepper.
- Don't be a sprepper.
Sprepper is this combination
of Sprite and Dr. Pepper.
It's sweet, but it's not
delicious.
- Raja, it's your turn.
- I've never done this before.
You guys have all done this
before I have.
Oh, BGB, girl.
Bye, girl, bye.
See ya later, Carmen.
I'll give ya a call.
I lost my cherry to being the
bottom two.
<i>- Finally, people.</i>
- Did you cry?
- I did a little bit.
I thought I was gonna go home
because of some guy that I'd
only known for two days.
<i>It was pretty close.</i>
<i>It was almost me.</i>
My only game plan at this point
is just to kick everyone's
asses, and I'm so close.
I am so close.
<i>[siren blares]</i>
<i>- Ooh, girl, you've got</i>
<i>she-mail.</i>
<i>Hey, big spenders.</i>
all: Hey!
<i>- I own everything.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>Or at least I act like I do.</i>
<i>You gotta fake it till you</i>
<i>make it, honey.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- Get that coin, girl.</i>
<i>'Cause if you don't,</i>
<i>there ain't nothing going on</i>
<i>but the rent.</i>
- What?
- What?
- Prostitution.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: [cheer]
- My ladies.
all: [cheer]
- You know, most drag
performers make their money
in tips, but to be America's
next drag superstar, you need
to make your moola selling it
to the masses.
Now, for today's mini challenge,
you'll become host for the
newest, hottest home shopping
channel--RuVC.
all: [laugh]
- You'll each have three
minutes to pitch one product,
an item you choose from your
own drag, and the one queen
who convinces me to order
her product will win.
You've got 20 minutes to put
together a quick drag
spokesqueen look.
And I'll see you on RuVC.
All right.
- Oh, my god.
Ah!
- Everybody in the room
including me look a mess.
<i>Raja looks like Rainbow Brite.</i>
<i>Manila actually was pretty</i>
<i>with less makeup.</i>
<i>And Yara, I don't even have</i>
<i>a clue.</i>
- The first thing I thought of
was you're not my tucker.
It's fresh out of my own drag.
It's something that I rely on
most often,
and why not sell it?
- I don't know if I look good in
brown hair, but...
- What are you wearing?
- Welcome to RuVC.
I wanna tell you about a product
today that has aromatherapeutic
powers, healing powers,
it can feminize you,
it could increase your libido.
Be right back. My gaff.
You take this part that would
normally cover your genitals,
and you stretch it over your
face, and it has invigorating
powers that immediately wakes
you up.
That's $6,934, uh, 60 clams
from a tribe in Africa,
and 4 goats, and you, too,
can own this--Raja's gaff.
Start ordering, everyone.
- Hi, my name is Manila Luzon.
You may have seen me on such
shows as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
or<i> Cops.</i>
I'm here to tell you about
this new product Man-ila.
You can use it for hair,
tabletop cleaner,
makeup finisher,
when you get these, like,
horrible runs in your nylons.
If you call right now,
we'll send you this free travel
cap that goes on top.
Thank you. Good-bye!
- Hi, America. I'm Yara Sofia.
It's kind of hard to find
the perfect hair.
And you can wear a perfect
pop-it-on.
See how gorgeous it is?
You can wear it like this,
and you can put it like this,
you can scrub yourself,
your body.
You know, we are drag queens.
You can use the pop-it-on
to clean your table.
Only 100 payments of $1.
You have to buy the pop-it-on.
Now, bye.
- My name is Alexis Mateo,
and I have a secret that I wanna
share with you--the hip pad.
If you always want the perfect
body but you cannot have it,
I got the magic solution
for you.
They are handmade
and hand-painted just by me.
For only two payments of $19.95.
But wait. If you call right now
in the last ten seconds,
I'm gonna give you handmade pads
for your ass Alexis.
The booty, the pads, everything
that you need to be a complete
drag queen for only two payments
of $19.95.
This is Alexis Mateo for RuVC.
- Hi.
all: Hi!
- Wow, wow. Ooh!
What do we have here?
Let's see what I ordered.
This is always so exciting.
- Yeah!
- Open it, open it, open it.
all: [cheer, applaud]
- It's a pop-it-on!
- A pop-it-on!
[laughs]
Say what, the pop-it-on!
Ah, she bought the pop-it-on!
Finally I--I win the mini
challenge.
- Yara, your prize for winning
the mini challenge is...
$1 million.
- What?
Gee! Whoo!
- Well, well, actually,
darling, it's 1 million Ru
dollars.
- Oh!
- Yes.
- What happened?
- Now, the pit crew was up
all night cooking up this dough
at Cat Print.
While these may not pay your
bills, they could come in handy
a little later, because it is
time for the most expensive
challenge in<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
her-story!
This week we are throwing
a make-dat-money ball,
and each of you will have to
come up with a portfolio
of three different looks
that you could take to the bank,
honey.
First category--Swimsuit Body
Beautiful.
You need to create a bathing
suit hot enough to attract
a billionaire.
Second category--
Cocktail Attire After 5:00.
You need to create a flirty,
short dress where all that
glitters is gold.
Third category--Evening Gown
Eleganza.
- Work.
- Using 2 1/2 million Ru paper
dollars,
you need to create a dress that
literally screams money.
Yara, because you won the mini
challenge,
you have an extra million
dollars to play with.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- We have three challenges
in a row that have multiple
looks for the runway.
Like, are you exhausted?
'Cause I'm exhausted.
- I feel like I'm a glamorous
sweatshop worker, if you will.
- That's just 'cause you're
Asian.
- [laughs]
- [sighs] Have you ever made a
swimsuit before?
- No, I haven't--
I've never made one.
- What're you gonna do
for a swimsuit?
- A gold swimsuit.
All I hear from the judges
all the time is that my body's
not right, that my walk is not
right, that my hair is not
right.
<i>I cannot please all the judges,</i>
<i>but that doesn't define</i>
<i>who I am.</i>
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with my body at all.
Probably something wrong with
Michelle's and Santino's body,
but it's not--nothing wrong
with my body.
I'm just the girl that wears
the pads and the titties
in the show.
- Alexis mentions her
insecurity coming in,
and it's all in her head,
I think.
- But they're not, like,
sleeping on you, Alexis.
Like, they love you.
You have a great personality.
- It's just bullshit.
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
- Why are you saying that
the judges are against you?
You have win three challenges,
girl.
- Now because of that,
I'm gonna get all fucked up.
- Fuck glue gun.
- Did you burn yourself?
- Fuck, fuck.
- Today's main challenge
is to make three distinct
money looks--uh, a swimsuit,
a cocktail dress, and an evening
gown--for Ru's make-dat-money
ball.
- Where's the only
fucking glue gun?
- We're stressed out, 'cause
it's gonna be a long day, honey.
- Some craziness.
<i>I know there's a lot of people</i>
<i>that think that I'm gonna do</i>
<i>wrong in this challenge.</i>
I don't have a clue
how this is gonna turn out.
I have never worked with this
kind of material, and every time
I try hard, I get shit.
- Girl! That--oh, maybe you
wanna start over.
- Um, I hate it.
I think we're all in a great
panic at this point.
There's very, very little time,
and I can feel the stress
in the room.
Oh, I hate starting over.
I can't stand this anymore.
- Hello, hello, hello!
-<i> Hola!</i>
- Are you ready for the
make-dat-money ball?
- Yes.
- Not yet.
- Hi, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru!
- Does this challenge frighten
you at all?
- Yeah, I am worried about it.
Like, it's so difficult.
I'm not a pro.
I'm not a designer.
- Okay, all right.
So, are you gonna do a whole
gold storyline here?
- You know what, Ru,
I have no clue what I want
to show on the stage.
<i>I'm talking to Ru,</i>
<i>and it was not going well.</i>
That scares me a lot.
- Who's your biggest
competition?
- It is Yara.
Yara have everything that I love
in a drag queen.
Her mind is very high-fashion,
and her personality is so,
so big.
Plus she's Puerto Rican.
- Uh-huh.
- So, if I don't win this
competition, another
Puerto Rican should be crowned.
- [laughs]
All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru!
- All right.
Yara Sofia.
- Hi!
- Tell me about money.
Are you free-spending,
or are you very frugal?
- I'm very free-spending.
- [laughs]
- I'm broke, but I'm still
fabulous.
- If you win the $75,000,
are you just gonna spend it?
- I am gonna move probably
to the states.
Puerto Rico, it's hard to find a
job.
- It's hard to find a job here
too.
- Yes, I know, but it--
in Puerto Rico, it's more hard.
- Do you make a living
making dresses?
- Yes. My inspiration
is Bob Mackie.
- You could be the next
Bob Mackie.
We need another Bob Mackie.
We need more wearable art.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to risk the American
dream.
I want to make my own line
of clothes.
And that's why I'm here, I'm--
because I love drag,
I love to make dresses.
This is my life.
- Ooh!
Look how delicious.
All this money.
You've been in the competition
for a long time.
Are you surprised that you've
lasted so long?
- Well, no, I knew that, like,
I was gonna be in for the long
haul.
I just didn't know you were
gonna bring all these girls and
have all these extra challenges.
- So, is it safe to say you
didn't come to the competition
to make friends, you came
to win?
- Uh, well, both.
I love meeting new people,
so I'm gonna make a lot of
friends, but if I have to stab
them in the back, I mean,
whatever.
- [laughs]
Well, hello, Raja.
- Hi, sexy lady.
- What are you working on now?
- Well, I'm basically making
an armature for a top hat made
out of coins and cash.
- Oh, wow.
Do you have enough time
to do something like that?
- I think so.
- All right. Now, tell me
something about the swimsuit.
- I wanna show my skinny body
and do just a bikini.
- How do you stay so skinny?
- I work out. I do Pilates and
yoga.
And with my, uh, $75,000 that
I win, I'll finally get
my gastric bypass.
both: [laugh]
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
All right, there's one more
thing that will make this week's
main challenge even richer.
<i>- Ah, no!</i>
- I want you to choreograph
a group number that will kick
off the make-dat-money ball.
<i>- On top of all this?</i>
Oh, my god, I'm gonna die.
- Now, Yara, since you won
the mini challenge,
you're in charge.
Oh, and you'll be shaking
your moneymakers to the song
<i>Just Wanna Dance</i>
by Miss La Toya Jackson,
because tomorrow on the main
stage, back again at my personal
request, we'll be joined by
Miss La Toya herself.
all: Yay.
- And our extra-special guest
judge will be<i> the New York Times</i>
best-selling author
Gigi Levangie Grazer.
- Cool. Yay.
- All right, ladies,
time is money, so get to work.
And, remember, don't fuck it up.
- Oh, my god!
- You have to measure your--
your size, and you have to make
the mannequin for you,
'cause it will take your shape.
- Alexis, is your fit gonna be
immaculate?
- You know what, I'm looking
like the way I want it to look.
If they like it, they like it.
If they don't like it, oh, well.
<i>I'm completely freaking out</i>
<i>right now.</i>
<i>I was feeling stressed out,</i>
<i>and I cannot do the challenge,</i>
<i>and it's horrible.</i>
You get to a point when you
cannot control your feelings
anymore.
<i>I just want this to be over.</i>
I just wanna go home.
- When I see Alexis packing,
what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?
both: [speaking Spanish]
- I am tired, I'm exhausted,
and to see Alexis packing,
it makes me feel angry.
- What's going on with, um,
Alexis?
- She's trying to give up.
I don't know.
- She's over it?
- She's trying to leave
the competition.
<i>- Alexis gave up and left this</i>
<i>competition.</i>
It's a very, very dark moment.
- I don't know where--
where is she? Where is she?
- I don't know.
I have had, like, meltdowns
and freak-outs, and I'm trying
to hold myself together, because
at any moment, it could happen.
Like, the pressure is so intense
right now.
- She told me, like, she gained
weight, and sometimes it's so
hard to make clothes for her.
- We have no time.
- No time!
- We have to do three outfits.
- It's frustrating for me,
'cause I don't want to be
uncomfortable.
- Anyway, well, guess I'm
gonna start putting shit
on my dress.
[sewing machine whirs]
I decided to, like, whip out
Sahara's picture because
it's like seeing my boyfriend is
a really great reminder
of why I'm here.
- Girl, what's going on with
that picture?
- Oh, It's Sahara Davenport.
The most beautiful drag queen
after RuPaul.
- Do you miss her?
- Fuck yeah, I miss the bitch.
- Cute.
- You know, I think I've tried
sewing a dress before,
with a slit in the side, and it
didn't work out.
So I don't know why I'm trying
this again.
Bitch man is not the tea.
- [sighs]
Stress, stress, stress.
[door squeaks open]
- [exhales]
-<i> Ay!</i>
You're scaring me.
You're a psycho bitch.
- It was just--I don't know.
I decided to stay in this
competition all the way
till the end.
<i>I'm here, bitches. I am here.</i>
I didn't came here to just
give up in the top four.
I came here to be America's
next drag superstar.
- Drama, girl.
- [chuckles]
- So, girls,
let's get--dance, girl!
It's time to go to rehearsal.
- Just 'cause RuPaul put you
in charge doesn't mean you have
to yell at us.
- I decide to split the
choreography between Alexis
and me, 'cause we have a great
connection and Alexis is
a good dancer.
- Here we go.
- Whoo! The coins!
- Get your coins, girl.
- Um, let's begin.
- What are we gonna do?
- Manila seems a little bit
terrified,
but so am I, so we're in this
together.
- First step.
Step with the right...
Shoulder, out.
Boom, bam.
Five, six, seven, eight, we do
this in line.
And we get out of the line.
We go back in line,
and we gonna repeat that again.
- Perfect.
- Whoo! Okay.
- Good job, darling.
Outsides all yours.
I told you, she's good.
- Here we go! And step.
Again, we got it, we got it, we
got it.
- I'm lost, I'm so lost.
Oh, what happened?
Oh, wait, what am I doing?
- Wait a minute.
[laughs]
- Wait, sorry.
What am I doing? Am I following
you?
I'm doing the opposite of you
now, right?
- [laughs]
- I'm still doing that?
I haven't done a choreographed
routine in such a long time.
I'm terrified.
- It's easy.
- Once I get this, you guys
better watch out.
- Okay.
- Oh, girl, you're gonna have to
catch up,
because it's not that difficult
to understand, so get it
together, bitch.
Hands up.
Then we going to the left,
to the right,
and go all the way to your ass.
Shakin' my ass.
- Yeah, darling!
- Shake your ass.
- Yeah!
- Manila, Manila, just shake
your back.
- [laughs]
- Yeah, we just shake the ass.
- How are you doing that?
- I'm moving, I'm moving.
- I don't know how to do this.
- The cha-cha is inside all of
you.
Hey, I want to do this.
It's like...
We supposed to be touching each
other's back.
- Oh, hey, girls.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
Boom!
Don't leave the back.
Don't leave the back.
No, no, what are you doing,
Manila?
- Again.
- Can we do this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can we just not put it in
front of our faces?
'Cause I don't want to block
this mug.
- Hey, hey, watch out!
- [exclaims in Spanish]
- I'm not really a dancer,
and so picking up choreography
is like not the easiest thing
for me to do.
<i>We're down to the final four.</i>
<i>I don't want to fuck this up,</i>
<i>so...</i>
Awesome, guys.
Go team.
- This is gonna be a mess.
- [laughs]
[alarm beeps]
- Money morning!
- Money, money, money,
money, money, money.
- Oh, my god.
Feel like I should've just had a
bed here.
- I know. Like, what was the
point of even going back home?
- We haven't sleep or nothing.
- There's a lot of pressure,
and it's really important for me
to do a great job on this
challenge, because it's one of
our last challenges.
And if I don't do a good job,
I'm gonna be in the bottom two
again.
[sighs] All right.
- You guys, did we use every
single glue stick there is?
- Yes.
- Yes, we did. See?
- Did you use the extra
million dollars?
- Yes, except for--
- Everything?
- Except for this one.
- Wow.
- 'Cause I wanted a big one.
- That's a lot of dress, honey.
<i>- Yara's is way too</i>
<i>complicated.</i>
<i>And I understand avant-garde,</i>
<i>but it's just really crazy.</i>
If she were to sit down in it,
it would look like a pile of
garbage.
Yara, it's like a tropical
garden.
It's really huge.
- I don't care if
the other girls will like it.
I'm focused on my stuff.
RuPaul is gonna love it.
- Who's top three?
- I would like to be me,
Yara, and Alexis.
- Manila, you think it's gonna
be easier for you to win
the competition if Raja's gone?
- If it all goes correctly,
then I should be in the top
three.
- If you don't make the top
three,
the decision is incorrect.
- Sure.
I put so much energy into this
competition from day one,
and I feel like I really worked
my hands to the bone,
and I need to be in the top
three.
It's just so close.
- The top three gonna be me,
Raja, and Yara.
- Never, never, never
in a million years.
Where's Manila going?
- Home. After tonight.
- Hey.
- I deserve it.
I want Alexis in the top three.
And the other one, I don't know.
- Since Manila and I had a--
had a pretty close relationship
throughout this competition,
I would like to see her there.
- I deserve it, motherfuckers.
I'm gonna make the top three,
because I worked very hard
for this, and I'm gonna let them
have it!
<i>[laughter]</i>
<i>- And what?</i>
Hey, guys!
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle, you like?
- I love.
- Mike Ruiz, you look like
a million dollars.
- Oh, so do you.
- Well, you know, as Dolly
says, "it takes a lot of money
to look this cheap."
- [laughs]
- Gigi Levangie Grazer,
how does a Hollywood wife make
her money?
- Well, we earn it the
old-fashioned way, RuPaul--
through divorce.
- [laughs]
- L.A. Toya, you're back by my
request.
- And I will do anything for
you, Ru, you know that.
- Oh, honey, that's big money,
La Toya, if you ask me.
both: [laugh]
- This week our queens
were challenged to create
three million-dollar looks
for the make-dat-money ball.
To kick things off,
they're gonna make it rain
to La Toya Jackson's
<i>Just Wanna Dance.</i>
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.

after 5:00.
Yara Sofia.
- She's the merry widow,
ready for her next husband.
- Yes.
- It's like she's getting ready
for Liberace's funeral.
- Uh-huh.
<i>- My cocktail dress is inspired</i>
<i>by Nina Ricci, like,</i>
<i>very Evita Peron,</i>
<i>very sophisticated, very dark.</i>
- And I love the gloves on her.
- It's very film noir.
- The widow wore gold.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Ooh!
-<i> Goldfinger.</i>
- Ooh!
<i>- With my cocktail dress,</i>
<i>I think about myself.</i>
<i>Alexis always cha-cha.</i>
<i>That's what the dress is.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna change myself</i>
<i>for nobody else.</i>
<i>I'm just gonna walk the dress,</i>
<i>and I know it looks sickening</i>
<i>on me.</i>
- The Golden Globes.
- It's like two canned hams
under a blanket, fighting it
out.
- Really, yes. Ooh, I love ham.
Manila.
- Hey, girl, hey!
- All right!
- Lots of attitude.
This reminds me of a disco.
<i>- Well, I don't know about Ru,</i>
<i>but I take my disco nap</i>
<i>at 5:00 P.M., so this is going</i>
<i>to be an after-5:00-A.M. Look,</i>
<i>yes, and, honey, I am still</i>
<i>partying, and I'm about to go</i>
<i>to the after-party, honey.</i>
- New year's eve 1984.
- Oh, my god.
'80s in the San Fernando Valley.
- For the love of money.
Up next, Raja.
Ooh, Raja and the gold rush.
<i>- The look for my cocktail</i>
<i>dress is a little bit heiress,</i>
<i>and it's a little eccentric.</i>
- I own everything, and I
bought it on my American Express
Gold card, darling.
Category is million-dollar
Evening Gown Eleganza.
Yara Sofia.
- She blew her cash wad.
- Yes.
It's Marie Antoinette.
- Cha-ching.
<i>- I'm doing my runway,</i>
<i>and I feel like a queen,</i>
<i>and it feels so great.</i>
<i>I feel so powerful.</i>
<i>The avant-garde for me</i>
<i>is everything.</i>
- She's got the credit cards
in there too.
- Her whole safety deposit box.
- Suze Orman called.
She wants her Fico score back.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Goddess of the sea.
- Yes. Yes, like scales.
- They're like fish scales.
<i>- I wanted to look like a</i>
<i>mermaid.</i>
<i>I wanted to look like tropical,</i>
<i>flowers, colors.</i>
<i>I wanted to look very pageant</i>
<i>as well.</i>
- It's like the Little Mermaid
meets Lil' Kim.
- Yes, it is!
Mo' money, mo' problems.
You can bet your bottom dollar,
and I do mean bottom.
Manila.
- Imelda markup.
- Imelda markup, that's right.
- It's better than a markdown.
<i>- For my evening gown made of</i>
<i>money, the judges are really</i>
<i>liking my look.</i>
<i>I think my hair is just so big</i>
<i>that they have to love it.</i>
<i>I mean, come on, who doesn't</i>
<i>love a drag queen with gigantic</i>
<i>hair?</i>
- She looks like a Texas
tycoon's wife.
- Yes!
Black gold.
both: Texas tea!
- [laughs]
- I think her economy
just double-dipped.
Up next, Raja.
- Wow.
- Ow!
<i>- Ultimately I had this idea</i>
<i>of this 1930s sort of starlet,</i>
<i>and she is going on a train</i>
<i>to the Hearst castle to meet up</i>
<i>with all of her fancy buddies,</i>
<i>and I think it looks fantastic.</i>
<i>I think I look like an exotic</i>
<i>bird.</i>
- She owns the world.
- If I had the dollars...
- Very Linda Evangelista.
- All the honeys making money.
Welcome, ladies.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
Yara Sofia.
- Yes?
- Penny for your thoughts.
- [chuckles]
This is my inspiration,
from Alexander McQueen.
- Yes.
- And the hair is my trademark.
My pop-it-ons.
- Your pop-it-ons.
- But this time covered
in money.
- Yara, you are absolutely
gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- I do think that it's
a bit busy.
All the gold necklace and then
the gold going into the bustier,
with the hair and the necklace,
it's almost like that.
- Your cocktail dress
presentation was a little
morose, and I would've hoped
that you would've been a little
more effervescent, you know,
on every level.
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I love what you've done
to this dress.
This is why I know you could've
done something much better
with the bathing suit than
what I saw.
- And it's pretty much the same
for your cocktail dress.
I think it was just a little
too simple for me.
- When you came out in
the bathing suit, I thought,
I'm so glad she got rid of Ike.
- [laughs]
- That Tina Turner wig was
fabulous. I loved it.
- The problem with the swimsuit
for me was that it was too
<i>abuelita.</i>
It was too grandma.
And because it was cut low,
it made you look bulky.
- All right, up next, Manila.
- Hi, judges.
- Now, tell us about this dress.
It looks like Beverly Hills
shrubbery.
- You know, at the end of
the night when you open your
drag bag to see all your tips...
- Yes.
- They're all crumpled
and sweaty, and so I thought
that it would be kind of
interesting to, like, tear up
money and crumple them,
and then, um, glue them on here.
- When I look at the pink
flower in your hair,
it's absolutely gorgeous.
It enhances your color tones.
I did feel and think your hair
was a little bit too big.
- How dare you!
all: [laugh]
- I'm a drag queen!
both: [laugh]
- Well, I loved your swimsuit
presentation.
It was very Saint-Tropez,
French Riviera.
It was very Samantha Jones,
you know, goes to the Hamptons.
I loved it.
- It all worked.
It was thought out, and it was
executed beautifully.
- The cocktail attire,
very Mahogany, very Diana Ross.
I wanna go to that cocktail
party.
- All right, up next, Raja.
- Hi.
- When you walk out,
you act as if you own the stage,
and I wanna focus on you,
because you give me, you demand
that attention from me.
And that's what I love about
you.
But your after-5:00 to me
was so plain.
It was so simple.
It was so ordinary.
The entire outfit, to be quite
frank with you, reminded me of
a Pointer sister.
- All right, ladies,
here's the $75,000 question--
why do you deserve to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
Let's start with Yara.
- I'm so broke.
all: [laugh]
- Uh, I don't have anything in
my bank.
My credit card is over--
is overdrawn, and I need money
to--to move to the states,
and I would like to live
the American dream.
I have charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
I have everything.
I'm the full package.
- All right, Alexis,
same question.
- I think I deserve to be
America's next drag superstar
because inside of me, like every
American and every real person,
I am not perfect, but I have
the desire to continue.
And if I can move forward
in the competition and become
America's next drag superstar,
I would do it with honor,
respect, and proud.
- Manila, why do you deserve
to be crowned America's next
drag superstar?
- I came to this competition
blessed.
I feel like I represent
the product of a loving
and supportive family.
I'm not a Cinderella story.
My parents didn't kick me out.
My parents have been very loving
and very supportive.
And I have a beautiful family.
And I think that I carry
a message of--to love and be
really supportive of--of all
your friends and your family,
because we all have, like,
the power inside of us.
We just need that extra push,
and I'm here to--
to speak that.
- Raja, same question.
- In winning this competition,
I would love to leave a legacy
for all those little boys...
[sighs]
All the little boys who are
teased, who are afraid,
who don't know how to express
themselves creatively yet,
you know, and they don't even
know that they're allowed to go
against the grain.
It's okay to say fuck you,
and do what you love to do,
and express yourself thoroughly.
I wanna be an example of someone
who is proud, someone who is
accomplished, and someone who
loves--loves what they do.
- The power of Fuck You.
all: [laugh]
- Well, girls, I think we've
heard enough.
Now, while you go and untuck
in the interior illusions
lounge, the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, just between us
gargoyles, what do ya think?
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
- To me, it looked like she got
run over by a Brink's truck.
- It was a miss.
It was too much.
- Her speech, I'm sorry,
but I felt for her.
- You're a softie.
- Oh, my god, this poor thing.
She doesn't have any money.
- I really felt for her,
but, you know, I don't think
we can pick a drag superstar
based on the fact that we feel
sorry for them.
- Right. All right,
let's move on to Alexis.
- She's not utilizing her body
the way she should and could.
Just the bathing suit alone.
- It was like a middle-aged
woman trying to get laid
at Jones beach.
- If you're gonna pick a
proportion like an hourglass
in that dress, why are you gonna
pull all of your hair back
into this teeny-tiny--
she looked like Beetlejuice.
both: [laugh]
- All right, let's move on
to Manila.
- The swimsuit was beautiful.
It was feminine. It was elegant.
Totally nailed the challenge as
far as that goes.
- She has incredible stage
presence.
She's always on when she's up
here.
She's the queen of that coy
kind of thing, and you have to
take that into consideration...
- Sure.
- When these people have your
name attached to them as
America's next drag superstar.
- Let's move on to Raja.
Now, I've just gotta start with
that gown...
- Crazy good.
- Which was just breathtaking.
- Two words about the cocktail
dress, Ru.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oil can.
- [laughs]
- I'm probably gonna lose it
again, but listening to Raja's
speech, I was one of those
little boys.
I was one of those little boys
who wanted a beacon of hope,
who wanted somebody to look up
to, to say, "you know what,
it's gonna be okay.
Be yourself, and be creative,
and be inspired, and think
outside of the box, and don't
let anyone ever tell you
that you can't."
You know, so, to me, I don't
even care what Raja was wearing
tonight.
- [claps]
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your performance
in the make-dat-money ball,
I've made some decisions.
Manila, this week you looked
like a high roller,
but did you hit the jackpot?
Raja, your Evening Gown Eleganza
was top dollar, but were you
outspent on the runway?
Manila, condragulations,
you are the winner of this
week's challenge.
- Oh, my god.
<i>- You will receive a collection</i>
<i>of fine jewelry from</i>
<i>Kathy Ireland Jewelry.</i>
- Thank you, guys.
I won, I won!
Two weeks in a row, bitches.
- Raja...
You're safe.
Alexis Mateo, Yara Sofia,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>- For me, being in the bottom</i>
<i>two is like losing.</i>
I feel horrible.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
<i>- Yara is my sister,</i>
<i>and I know what the competition</i>
<i>means to Yara.</i>
She wants this so bad,
but I want it too.
- Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
<i>- I cannot even think.</i>
<i>I cannot perform.</i>
<i>I have to lip-synch to convince</i>
<i>the judges that I'm good.</i>
<i>I don't know if I can.</i>
<i>- I'm crying because there's</i>
<i>a lot of emotions.</i>
<i>I was thinking too much.</i>
<i>I'm so angry,</i>
<i>and I'm so disappointed.</i>
<i>I'm a mess.</i>
- [sniffles]
- All right, ladies,
I have made my decision.
- [sniffles]
[sobs]
- Yara...
[speaks Spanish]
- Alexis Mateo,
Shante, you stay.
- I told you.
Don't worry about it.
- [speaking indistinctly]
[sobs]
I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
It's emotional.
We've all been there.
- [sobs]
- Yara Sofia, listen to me.
The sparkle you have,
the sparkle you brought to
this competition, no one can
wash off.
It's there, it's yours.
You are a star.
Remember this--
<i>Echa, echa, echa pa'lante.</i>
Now, sashay away.
- [kisses]
<i>The lip-synch was so awful</i>
<i>for me, 'cause I didn't expect</i>
<i>to be in the bottom two,</i>
<i>but it's not my decision.</i>
And this is for Puerto Rico.
So, I'm gonna<i> echa pa'lante,</i>
darling.
I'm fine. I'm--I'm so happy.
Um, I did my best, and this is
me.
I don't know.
I have too much to offer.
- All right, ladies.
You're the top three.
Let me tell you something.
Everyone on this panel can
attest that show business
is a tough business.
It can be very painful,
but we go on.
If you cannot love yourself...
Say it with me.
How in the hell...
- How in the hell...
- You gonna love somebody else?
- You gonna love somebody else?
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.
- Amen.
- All right.
Now, let the music play.
Let's celebrate.

-<i> Previously on RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race...</i>
Snatch game!
- Yay!
- Okay.
- Hi, how are you?
- Ooh, ooh!
- Naomi Campbell is
a cum-guzzling whore!
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
- Stacy.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- To see Stacy win,
and I'm in the bottom two?
W.T.F.?
- Delta Work.
Shantay, you stay.
This is the emancipation
of Mariah.
Now sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
It's time to bare your souls.
<i>The queens have their cake...</i>
- Aw, thanks.
-<i> And eat it too.</i>
- I took a bite of it
and I swallowed.
- Oh, dear.
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>Sara Rue and Eliza Dushku.</i>
<i>The winner of RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
- Morning.
- We're walking
into the workroom today.
And the whole entire room
is empty.
And at this point,
we're eight left,
and I need to step up my game.
- There's a message.
Aww.
- Cheers to Mariah.
- Mariah!
- Mug for days.
- Mug for days.
- I'm gonna erase it.
- The more people leave,
the happier I'll be.
It's just less noise in my ear.
I'm just an old granny,
and I just can't handle all
the yip-yap, chitter-chatter.
- So are you excited you won?
- I am.
Pulled that shit out
at the last minute, girl.
- I actually, like,
wasn't expecting it.
I don't know if Stacy's amazing
job last week was a fluke.
She's like the underdog that
people aren't paying
attention to.
- I'm proud of myself because,
you know, I had doubted myself
a few days ago.
There's people
in this competition
who feel like I'm not talented.
But I feel confident now.
So, you know, fuck these
other bitches, honey.
I feel like I'm gonna win
this shit.
- Heather.
- Heather wants to talk to us.
- Come hither, Heather.
- Heather, what are you making?
- I'm making my skirt, Heather.
Carmen, Manila, Delta and myself
have decided to call each
other "Heather."
Because we formed this clique
which looks a lot
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>
- We're basically
the pretty girls,
the top four.
And then there's
the other girls.
- Ooh, she left--
what did she leave?
Earrings, these are cute.
- We take a lot of pride
in what we do.
And, um, I think that's where
we find a common ground.
So, so be it.
We're Heathers.
[laughter]
[siren wails]
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>
all: Hey.
-<i> I've got a little secret</i>
<i>I want to share with you.</i>
<i>I like cake.</i>
- Ooh!
- Oh!
-<i> Big, German chocolate cake.</i>
- Ooh.
-<i> If I could, I'd have a hot</i>
<i>cake in my mouth</i>
<i>first thing every morning.</i>
- Me too.
-<i> If you love cock the way</i>
<i>I do, just be careful.</i>
<i>Don't bite off more</i>
<i>than you can chew.</i>
all: Oh, my God.
- I don't want
to eat anything crazy.
- It's cake.
- Oh, it's not cock?
- [laughing]
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
- My girls.
Now, a drag superstar needs
to be able to serve womana,
even when she's stripped of her
wigs and padding and things
of that nature.
Now, I posed undraped
for a photograph in my book,
<i>Working It.</i>
And I did it without
compromising my Christianity.
I found the experience
so liberating,
I wanted to share it with you.
- Thank you.
- Now, for today's
mini-challenge,
you'll be posing for a tasteful,
intimate, feminine portrait.
And you'll be doing it
in the nude.
- Oh!
- Ooh!
- My heart just drops.
You know, I don't even like
to have sex naked.
- Now, in a moment you'll meet
celebrity photographer
Deborah Anderson,
who's renowned for
her artful nude portraits.
You have ten minutes to prepare.
You may use light makeup,
then it's time
to bare your souls.
Bye.
Let the games begin.
- Are you fucking serious?
My fat ass has got to take off
these clothes?
Y'all bitches is crazy.
- Oh, Jesus, take the wheel.
I just really don't want
to do this.
I have been single for a reason,
and now America is going
to find out why.
- Where is my bathrobe?
Oh, shit.
-<i> Hi, Stacy.</i>
<i>This is Deborah.</i>
- I have a piece of fabric
that you can use a little.
There's no pressure;
you do whatever feels
most comfortable to you.
- Let's get naked.
-<i> Serving womana.</i>
- All of a sudden I had
this spiritual awakening
that happened to me.
And I fell into it.
- Ooh, fabulous, fabulous.
Let's discuss the socks.
- Oh, right.
Gotta have these off.
- [laughing]
There you go, perfect.
Beautiful.
- You cannot knock the modeling
powers of Raja.
Put me in front of a camera,
and I will pose you down.
- Beautiful, right there.
There you go, there you go.
Beautiful.
Careful now,
not too much backside.
-<i> Too much ass.</i>
- I can't see anything.
- Yeah.
I wonder if you straighten
that top leg.
- There you go, there you go.
There.
- Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
A work of art.
- Bring that leg up, bring
that--beautiful, right there.
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
<i>Fabulous.</i>
That body?
You kidding me?
Keep moving that face,
my darling.
It's like we've got
the same face in every frame.
I want choice, darling.
- Okay, I can do that.
- Otherwise, we're stuck
with one picture.
<i>Love.</i>
<i>Just watch where your light is.</i>
- You feel like you're
a little tentative here.
- It's horrible, the feeling
is just horrible.
I just want it to be over.
- Alexis, Alexis.
Look at me.
You're not there.
All I see is your nervousness.
Focus, focus.
Give me drama, okay?
We want the confidence,
we want the beauty.
And find that light.
-<i> Ooh, loving that.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>Loving, loving.</i>
Hi, Delta.
- Hi, how are you?
I'm so scared.
All I can think is
that this lady's
gonna freakin' laugh at me.
Deborah, nice to meet you.
- Oh, the joy.
I get a kiss, I love that.
- But I realize, this is it.
If I want to be the next drag
superstar, I have to do it
at all costs.
- If you indeed want to use it.
- I want to use every yard
of it.
[both laughing]
- Yeah, feel that light.
- There we go, there we go.
Beautiful.
Yes, loving that.
Loving that.
-<i> Gorgeous.</i>
<i>A new dawn for Delta.</i>
- And darling, we are done.
- Oh, cool.
- Awesome.
- [laughing]
- My biggest fear was met today.
I met it head-on.
I felt so liberated.
I would love to do it again.
- We won't be able to get you
to put clothes on anymore.
- No, I don't think so.
Carmen Carrera better watch out.
- [laughing]
Ladies, all I can say is
you give good flesh.
But one of your nude portraits
stood head and shoulders
above the rest.
Carmen Carrera.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
[applause]
Yay, I won.
Piece of cake.
- Now that we've all gagged on
Carmen's cheesecake photo,
I hope you've left room
for dessert.
For this week's main challenge,
each of you will be designing a
couture designer dress inspired
by one of these mouth-watering
cakes.
There's angel food,
red velvet, pineapple upside
down, chocolate lava,
cheesecake, princess cake,
carrot cake,
and my favorite,
strawberry shortcake.
[giggles]
Now, Carmen.
Because you won
the mini-challenge,
you will assign each queen
a cake.
I'm gonna start off
with this cheesecake.
- Aw.
- Thank you.
Carmen's gonna give me the one
with the boring colors.
I knew exactly
what she was doing.
- We'll go with
the pineapple upside down.
- One of my favorites.
- Mm...
We'll give it to Shangela.
- Aw, thanks.
Would you be happy with
a pineapple upside down cake?
- Who's got some shortcakes
here?
Yara.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Red velvet.
Mmm.
Stacy.
- My favorite.
- Angel food cake is next.
For the cool kids, I want to
make sure that they're taken
care of.
Delta Work.
- Aw.
- Carrot cake, Manila.
- Oh, yay!
- Chocolate lava,
that leaves one person.
- Thank you.
- And that leaves the princess
cake for the princess herself.
- Princess cake is the prettiest
one, so it's mine.
- Now to create
your perfect face, face,
face of cakes outfit,
you can use materials provided
by Michael Levine fabrics.
Your couture confection should
look good enough to eat.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
See you later.
-<i> Whoo!</i>
<i>Got a cake, got a cake.</i>
<i>Got a cake, cake, cake.</i>
- I kind of need to be inspired
by my cake.
I need to taste it first.
Mm.
I'm getting an idea.
There's nothing I love more
than chocolate.
I could drip it
all over my naked,
lithe body over and over again
and just lick it off myself.
- Is anyone nervous?
Shangela?
- Evil bitch.
- Ha.
- The sewing challenges
in this competition
continue to be my downfall.
- When you put this together,
they create these barriers.
- Oh!
But what about the bottom?
- The fabric is not enough.
- Oh, no.
- No, this is the front.
This is just the front.
And where's the back?
You know what I mean?
- Right.
Now the question is, am I going
to fall in the hole,
or am I going to be able
to jump over that hole?
- So, Shangela,
what are you making?
- A dress.
Today's challenge is that we
have to create a high-fashion
couture outfit,
based on the type of cake
that we were assigned.
There are tons of girls left in
this competition that sew.
And here I am, still over there
trying to get the one-two
stitch down.
- Cuteness.
Heather, can you help me?
- Yes, Heather.
- I think it's hilarious we're
calling each other Heather now.
- Well, I mean, aren't we?
Those are our names.
- Like, didn't they all kill
each other?
- Well, yeah.
Only one Heather stands.
Right, Manila?
- Hello, my sweets.
all: Hi, Ru!
- Can I borrow a cup of sugar?
- Sure, darling.
- How you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?
- This cake is almost all gone.
- Well, not really.
It's just a few slices.
Part of the description
of this competition
was to do cake couture.
- Mm-hmm.
- You understand
what couture is?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Pretty much.
- Yeah.
- One-of-a-kind,
special details.
- Honestly, I'm not a
high-fashion kind of drag queen.
So I think that's one of the
biggest obstacles I have
to overcome.
- All right,
I want to see fashion.
So I will see you
on the main stage.
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right.
Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- So tell me about
your carrot cake couture dress.
- I'm kind of drawing from
Givenchy meets Jessica Rabbit
meets<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bunny.</i>
- Oh, that's a lot of ideas
going on there.
Are you sure you can incorporate
all of this?
- Well, I'm gonna try.
- Okay.
I can't wait to see it.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, of course this outfit
looks like cheesecake.
- I'm going for it.
- You're gonna go for it.
- That's the idea.
- Now, how are you gonna make
this more high-fashion couture?
- I will work with the style
of it.
It's not going to be
evening-gown Cinderella.
It's just gonna be
a high-fashion model.
- All right, kiddo.
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.
- Yes, thank you for visiting
me, Ru.
- All right, kiddo.
Yara Sofia.
- Yes.
- You're doing the strawberry
shortcake.
- Yes.
- Now, you sew for a living.
- I love to sew, I love it.
I'm gonna give the judges
a couture high-fashion dress,
but well-done.
I'm a strong, wicked bitch.
- All right, kiddo.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Raja.
- Hi, Ru.
- Chocolate lava cake.
- Hold me, Ru.
- [laughing]
- I took a bite of it,
and I swallowed.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness.
- I swallowed it.
I'm a terrible model.
- But you had to bite it to get
your inspiration, right?
- Sure, sure.
- I've always been really
obsessed with different, like,
historical silhouettes.
So I just happened to have
these, like, French peignoirs,
and I was, like, maybe I can
kind of play with that with,
like, a little bit of an exotic,
Indian, spicy kind of thing.
- All right, get back to work.
- Okay, see you later.
- All right.
Delta Work.
- Hi, Ru.
- Angel food cake.
- Yes.
- Are you a fan?
- I am.
Of all the cakes
that you could go get,
it's the lowest in fat.
So I can eat the most of it.
- [laughing]
- I think I need to bring
something youthful.
- Yeah.
- And I think I need
to bring something fresh.
Because the characters that I've
been doing have always been
older than who I am.
- Right.
I think it's about making
something that's contemporary.
I know that that's what
the judges are looking for.
- I like that.
- Yeah.
I look forward to seeing
some fresh cake on the runway.
- I'm excited.
- All right, go for it.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Why did you choose
a princess cake?
- 'Cause I was just drawn
to the color.
- This is, like,
green and pink and white.
- But you're going
with just the pink here.
It's the Barbie interpretation
of a princess, isn't it?
- When I hear Barbie from Ru,
I'm like, "This is wrong."
I'm not trying
to be princess Barbie.
- Well, listen, I'm gonna let
you get back to creating
your Jersey couture.
- My Jersey couture, yes.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- All right.
Hey, Miss Shangela.
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?
- [deep breath]
I'm okay.
- On season two,
you had problems sewing.
- Yes.
- And it's what ultimately
got you eliminated.
How's it going this time?
- I don't know.
You know--
- You're nervous.
- I am.
- Has anyone offered to help you
out at all?
No?
Do you feel like the other girls
are not supporting you?
- I know this is a competition,
and everyone's out
for themselves.
- But you have helped
other girls.
Do you expect them to help you?
- I would--I would like that.
- Well, I think it starts
with you asking.
- What?
Seriously?
Like, Ru has been asking,
"Has anyone helped you today?"
And, bitch, she's made
the other girls her puppets.
- It's sometimes hard for me
to ask for help.
- Well--
- But I will, I will.
- Get in there
and make this happen.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Gather around, ladies.
Every time I watch one of those
cake decorating shows,
I say to myself,
"My queens could do a better job
in their sleep."
So in addition to finishing
your cake couture dresses,
you need to turn a real cake
into the ultimate edible
accessory.
- We have no time to make
these fucking dresses,
and now we gotta make a cake.
I don't want to see no more
motherfucking cake!
- Starting with a naked cake
and a look-alike doll,
the icing on the cake will be
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
The end result should look
a little something like this.
You'll be debuting your
cake-stravaganza ensemble
tomorrow on the main stage.
And our guest judges will be two
sweet and stylish actresses.
The ever popular Sara Rue.
- Oh, my gosh!
- Ooh!
- And Eliza Dushku.
all: Ooh!
- Ladies, good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Oh!
- I need to figure out
how the frick
I'm gonna decorate a cake.
- Now I got a cake to do too?
- I feel sick.
- This is gonna be a challenge
that we're gonna remember.
We have to not only create an
outfit for the runway look,
we have to create a cake that
represents who we are.
I don't even cook nothing
at home.
- Here we have our guest chef
from North Carolina.
What are you doing, girl?
- Uh, first I'm gonna ice
this motherfucker.
- Oh, really?
Ooh.
- You got to whip it good.
- Whippin' it, whippin' it,
whippin' it.
- No, no, whippin' is like this.
- No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm the chef.
- [laughing]
- Ew, that's not me.
That's some booger.
Who the fuck is that?
Yara's is beautiful.
- Yes, Yara, yours is hot.
Bitch, they retouched hers.
- Word of advice, do not leave
your cakes out in the rain.
- [laughing]
- Look at my Native American
[indistinct].
- What tribe are you from?
I don't really know.
- Lumbee Indian.
This is the traditional pinecone
circle.
- What's on the arm?
- Fancied-out shawl.
Being the only Native American
in this competition,
I thought it would be different,
you know,
not just to decorate the cake
in my own style,
but, you know,
to represent my heritage.
- I offered Shangela to help her
with her garment,
because, for me,
it's nice to see
that somebody actually takes
advice and trusts you.
Because in a competition
like this one,
it does tell me a lot
about Shangela.
It amazes me how you trust me.
- Yeah.
- When you know I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.
- Oh, that's great.
That makes me feel real good
right about now.
Oh, I go on the outside
of your stitch?
- Even if you're going on top
of it, it doesn't matter.
You're just going to reinforce.
- It's okay,
I'm just reinforcing it.
Okay, cool.
Ooh.
Oh, crazy.
Oh, come on.
Work with mama, work with mama.
- Shangela gets the most
of her help from Alexis.
She gets makeup help,
now she's getting sewing help.
And if Alexis would have left
last challenge,
then maybe Shangela would have
just been sitting there,
confused.
- This machine,
this bitch's name is Bertha.
Work, Bertha!
Oh, fuck.
- Ugh, annoying.
- Now you know.
- Hey, Raja.
What does your family think
about you getting in drag
and stuff?
- Oh, they like it.
They know that I enjoy doing it.
So...
- That's all that matters, huh?
- Yeah, that's it.
What about you?
- My mom was, like,
really cool about it.
- And what about your dad,
where's he at?
- My father passed away
when I was two, in the '80s.
- Oh, babe.
- I met his family, like,
a year ago.
- Really?
- I didn't know them.
I didn't have any type
of relationship with them.
But, yeah,
it's just really weird.
Like, I'm trying to, like, find
out little by little as much
as I can about him.
Growing up, I had my mom,
I had my grandmother.
And it was enough for me.
But I always wondered, how would
my personality have changed,
having my father in my life?
But I'm very happy
for who I am now.
- What was the reaction,like,
when you met your dad's family?
- I wasn't going to keep it from
them that I was gay.
They kind of gagged
a little bit.
So after that shocker,
I was like,
"Oh, and I do drag
on top of that."
- Oh, awesome.
- And then they gagged again.
And after that,
everything's cool.
- Manila,<i> ven aqui.</i>
- Yes, mama.
How can I help you?
- When you won your challenge,
did you feel a little bit of
extra pressure after winning?
- Oh, for sure.
No, they're looking at you
even harder.
- Judging, and--
- 'Cause you were, like, you
were the best of the best.
And, like,
once you're at the top...
- Mm-hmm.
- The only way to go is down.
So, like, you have to prove it
to everyone.
And be, like, I'm gonna be
on the top again.
- I'm just trying to figure out
couture,
'cause I don't wear couture.
I don't know.
I felt very confident
at the beginning.
You know, Ru comes over.
And I went from maybe
a nine to, like, a three
in, like, ten minutes.
So I don't know
what to do anymore.
I mean, what do I do?
- What is this?
They're, like, strawberries?
- No, I don't know what the fuck
that was, girl.
I just designed it.
It doesn't even look couture.
- Huh?
- How would it look in here?
- Uh, like a football player.
- I don't know;
it was just an idea.
- I mean, I like
the asymmetrical look of it.
Yeah, do, like, one side.
Make it asymmetrical.
That's always more couture.
But I ain't gonna tell you how
to design your damn thing.
- [laughing]
- 'Cause, honey,
I'm gonna win this one.
Check.
- Okay.
[alarm clock ringing]
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh la la!
- Look at the mess.
- Look at this mess.
- Cake time.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning.
We have to decorate the cake.
And we have to finish our
costumes for today's runway.
- So this morning, I'm looking
at my sequined dress.
And I'm, like,
"Listen, these judges are gonna
read me down."
This dress isn't my style
of cake.
- Hey, Carmen.
- What are you doing?
What do you think
about the dress?
Tell me.
- About my dress?
- Yes.
- I found some really nice green
fabric today, thank God.
And I just whipped something up
real quick.
- Oh, so you sew.
- Well, I guess I do now.
- Yeah!
[laughing]
- Let me do your braid.
Oh, here you have...
It's pretty?
- Yeah, it's pretty.
Maybe, can we start it higher?
- Yes, it could be.
- Yara was helping Shangela
style her wig.
Yet again, help.
She needs a lot of help.
- She's like fucking doing
her hair.
- I know.
- It just really upsets me.
I'm representing myself here,
not the work of other people.
- Bless her helpless
little heart.
- For today's main challenge,
we actually have to design
a high-fashion cake look.
And we actually have
to decorate a cake.
- Oh, I've always wanted to put
safety pins on a child's cake.
- Oh, well.
Hallelu.
Can I make a suggestion,
just an artistic one?
- Yeah, most definitely.
- Just bring the corn up higher.
Right now it looks like corn
straight out of the can.
- Is that a read?
I didn't say anything about
that graffiti mess
that she had going on
on her cake.
- Ooh, work.
- But I decided
to take her advice
and add a couple more kernels.
Hallelu.
- What a beautiful corn
you've made.
- Yeah.
- Shangela.
- I need iridescent.
- Yara, do you think it's cute?
It looks like a cheesecake.
- Ooh, Alexis' costume.
She might be in trouble.
I mean, there's nothing more
unflattering
than to, you know, strap
a blanket around your waist.
- I'm freaking out.
I still have a lot
of finishing touches
on my runway look.
I really don't know how
I'm gonna finish this cake
and finish my outfit
before the runway time.
- Raja.
- What--
Oh!
- Is there any way to get
a little bit more height here?
- Let me see, Stacy.
- Not with these.
- [laughing]
I was about to say.
- It looks like comfy couture.
Stacy's couture,
runway worthy outfit,
inspired by tights.
Hmm... bold move.
- I have the colors,
I have the white shoes.
I have capris.
I feel like it's couture.
[laughter]
- Hello!
- Hey!
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage.
- RuPaul!
- Billy B.
Why, you old geezer.
- I'm hungry.
- Sara Rue.
- Hello.
- Love the name.
- Ooh, yeah.
I love yours.
- Eliza Dushku.
- That's right.
- Welcome to my dollhouse.
- I'm Susie stalker fan
right now.
I love you, Ru.
- Security.
- [laughing]
- This week,
we challenged our queens
to create cake-inspired
couture dresses
and then to decorate a doll cake
that expresses
their true drag persona.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Yara Sofia, serving
strawberry shortcake.
- Look at those stems.
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.
-<i> I'm bringing a Puerto Rican</i>
<i>strawberry shortcake.</i>
- Now, I see her berries.
But where's her twig?
- It's hiding in the vine.
- Serving carrot cake, Manila.
Ooh, as a blonde.
- What up, doc?
- Where's she hiding
that carrot?
-<i> I have my Madonna Louis</i>
<i>Vuitton rabbit ears.</i>
<i>I got my cute little</i>
<i>Samantha Jones belt on.</i>
<i>And I'm just going to pump down</i>
<i>that runway</i>
<i>like a starving model.</i>
- Trix are not for kids
with this one.
- Mm.
- That's right.
Alexis Mateo,
serving cheesecake.
- She's a high-end cheesecake.
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling high-fashion.</i>
<i>I just want to serve drama</i>
<i>at this point.</i>
- Designer cheesecake.
- A little bit
Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.
- [laughing]
- That's there, too.
Princess cake,
from Carmen Carrera.
- Of course.
- Of course.
-<i> I'm serving something</i>
<i>really different:</i>
<i>a different hairstyle.</i>
<i>I have the shaved side thing,</i>
<i>that, like, Cassie, and other</i>
<i>celebrities are doing.</i>
- Paris Hilton.
- Paris Hilton, that's right.
- Heatherette.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Oh, here's one hot piece
of cake.
- Mm-hmm.
- Red velvet cake.
From Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw.
-<i> I have my puffiness going on.</i>
<i>I have my white</i>
<i>and my red velvet.</i>
<i>I know I look delicious, honey.</i>
- This would make me get
off my diet.
- Shangela,
pineapple upside down cake.
- It's like Barbra Streisand
meets pineapple cake
with a touch of Rapunzel.
-<i> I'm serving "pineapple upside</i>
<i>down keep turnin' me" cake.</i>
<i>I'm serving cake</i>
<i>on my shoulder,</i>
<i>and I'm definitely serving</i>
<i>cakes in the rear.</i>
- She's all pretty
with a cherry on top.
- Always gotta have the cherry.
It's the first thing to go.
- Yes, it is.
Delta Work,
angel food cake!
- [gasps] Look, it's the teen
angel food cake.
- It is teen angel.
-<i> I hit the stage today, and</i>
<i>I think it's undeniable that</i>
<i>I'm doing angel food cake.</i>
<i>I feel confident.</i>
<i>I know that there's no way</i>
<i>that I can land in the bottom.</i>
- Heaven must be missing
an angel food cake.
- Uh-huh.
Peggy Lee stole it.
- That is Raja,
serving chocolate lava cake.
-<i> I step out onto the runway,</i>
<i>and I am completely aware that</i>
<i>there's a possibility</i>
<i>of my undergarment showing.</i>
<i>But the rest of it</i>
<i>is pretty awesome.</i>
<i>And so what if a little bit</i>
<i>is showing underneath.</i>
- It's bubbling lava, honey.
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.
- And a glass of milk.
- Ooh!
- Welcome, ladies.
It's time
for the judges' critique.
Yara Sofia.
Tell us about your doll cake.
- This is mini-me.
She's wearing a national costume
with the Puerto Rican flag.
-<i> Echa pa'lante!</i>
- Yes!
- Now let's hear
from our judges.
- Did you have a run-in with
the police this morning?
Because someone beat the hell
out of your face.
- Thank you, thank you.
- I love the dress.
I knew instantly you were
strawberry shortcake.
- When you're wearing white,
wearing a darker undergarment
might not be the best.
Just 'cause it pulled me out
of the fantasy.
- Sara, a little inside
information.
There's a lot more than
a dark underwear going on
underneath there.
- [laughing]
- Let's move on to Stacy Layne
Bryant Matthews Lattisaw Q.
- As everybody knows,
I'm Native American.
I actually decorated
in a traditional regalia
for a female.
- You definitely pulled off
the red velvet.
And it made me hungry.
- Would you like to taste?
- You and I have this thing.
You know I do.
- [laughing]
- It's too simple.
- All of the interest
is up here.
It sort of looks like you had
a skid and have a strawberry
and then some glitter got in it.
- The outfit's not couture
in my eyes.
- All right.
Up next, it's Manila.
- This is little baby Manila,
and she took a little trip down
to Chinatown,
and she got a whole buttload
of fake designer purses
shoved up underneath this dress.
- When you first came out,
the belt, I loved it.
And then I hated it.
And then I loved it.
- Yeah, and you know.
Loving something and hating
something
at the same time
is very couture.
I mean, you've got
a lot going on.
- Yeah.
- Right, right.
- Your makeup here looks like
that you had an accident with
the flour when you
were making the cake.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
Now tell me
about your doll cake.
- It screams Latina.
It screams passionate.
This doll is actually who I am.
Just in a cake.
- One thing that I think
about the skirt.
It's not particularly
flattering.
You have to admit.
I mean, there are bedspreads
made out of that.
- We girls are trying
to maintain a figure.
And, to me, that adds
unnecessary bulk.
- What is the material that you
used to wrap around your hair?
- It's just fabric.
- I feel like if you're gonna do
that,
like, really show that fabric
and make it precise,
so that it's really sleek.
- Is it plain?
Yes, but maybe that's how you
wanted to represent yourself.
- Up next, Raja.
- I wanted it to feel really
edgy and very straight
and punk and fun.
Sort of like me.
- You reminded me how much
I love chocolate.
For sure.
- Your makeup went a little bit
more spooky
than I think you meant for it.
It's too Goth, I think.
- I wanted to yell out when you
were walking, like,
"Oh, no, honey!
We see your white bloomers."
- I know.
- Now, Sara.
- Yes, Ru.
- Would you put that cake
in your mouth?
- No, I would rub it
all over my body.
- [laughing]
- I think that cake's amazing.
- All right.
Carmen Carrera.
- Thinking about my cake,
I just wanted to put a lot
of that, like, queen,
like, pageant girl,
that I have in me.
I just wanted it to be pretty
and sparkly.
- And you're very diamond
princess, like Trina.
And how'd you go from turning
your dress from pink to green?
- When me and you had spoke,
the minute you mentioned Barbie,
I was like, "I don't want to be
Barbie princess on the runway."
- The dress and the belt, and
I think your hair and all of
that--I'm not sure how it
becomes a princess,
except maybe the princess
of New Jersey.
- Being a Jersey girl,
I'm very proud to say
that you look
like the princess of New Jersey.
But here's the thing.
You're way sexier
than that doll.
You should have done her sexier.
- Can we just talk
about from the neck up?
This sort of, like, mohawk off
to the side
with those jewels,
it's gorgeous.
- Next up, Delta Work.
- I really like
what I'm wearing.
I thought I would sort of do
an inspiration of that
in, like, a little ball gown.
So I made sure that I had,
like, pearls.
And then there's rosettes on
here that mimic the rosettes
that are at the bottom--
- Oh, yes.
- Trim of, um, here.
- Delta, I loved
your look tonight.
I think it's glorious.
- Thank you so much.
- And your cake is on fire.
- It reminds me of that scene
in<i> Grease,</i>
where she's a beauty-school
dropout.
- Oh, yes!
- Frenchie.
- It just, like--yeah!
I just think it's great.
It made me happy
when you walked out.
I was, like, "Oh!"
- Up next, Shangela.
- The doll cake
is very Shangela.
Of course, corn has always
haunted me and I've embraced it.
As you can see,
the Shangela has a hand up.
She's saying hallelu.
- The dress, it's cute.
It didn't totally blow me away.
But I mean,
it makes sense for your cake.
- With the makeup, something
is freaking me out today.
You're much friendlier
and prettier of a person
than the way you're painted.
- All right, this is my question
for you, Shangela.
- Yes.
- All these queens
that I see in front of me,
I can tell that being a queen
is their life.
I question that about you.
Is being a drag queen
what you really want to do?
- Yes.
You know, some people have 20
years doing drag,
and I only have
a little over one.
- Understood.
- But I'm here
because I want to be here.
And I'm here because I want
to be the Next Drag Superstar.
100%.
- Okay.
- Shangela, one last question.
- Yes.
- Who do you think should go
home tonight?
- Carmen Carrera.
- Clearly I have to disagree
with Shangela.
I mean, I think that my outfit
is a little bit more
high-fashion than hers.
- I'll present the
same question to Stacy.
- Carmen.
There's high-fashion looks here,
but just don't feel
like she executed that.
- Same question.
Delta Work.
- Stacy.
You know, I think maybe Stacy
thinks, like,
sometimes, "Well, I'm big, so
there should be
some accommodation made."
And I don't allow
any accommodation for myself.
- Manila, I want a serious
answer from you.
- I would like to see
Shangela go.
She's just a loudmouth,
and she's always talking
and hallelu-ing.
- Raja.
- Stacy and Shangela,
get the fuck out.
- Tell me why.
- Oh, Stacy.
I--you know, I'm not sure
if she's ready.
And Shangela, although
your personality shines,
I think you should be
on season five or six.
That's where you should be.
- That's interesting, Ru,
because Raja's been in the game
for 20-plus years doing drag,
and I've been only for one.
And we're in the same
competition here.
- Well, girls.
I think we've heard enough.
While you go and untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls.
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
The dress.
Would you wear that dress?
- No.
- She was supposed to recreate
a couture creation
of her cake that she was given,
which is a strawberry shortcake.
And I thought
that was interpreted
and executed flawlessly.
- She keeps building
in this competition
in ways that we really
didn't anticipate.
- She's the dark horse.
- The pro is her personality.
- Her cake was hysterical.
- It was.
Here, I'm gonna take a little
taste of her cake right now.
- Mm.
- Good?
- It's moist.
Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw Q.
- I am a sucker
for people's backstory.
And I think the fact
that she's from Swampville.
- Back Swamp, yeah.
- I don't want to fall in love
with somebody's backstory.
I want to fall in love with
what's on the stage.
- The reality of it tonight
is that she looked awful.
- Manila.
Now, Manila's dress
I thought was fantastic.
I wasn't crazy
about all the accessories.
- It was just kind of strange
and cartoony in a way.
- I was so obsessed with
that gray, cadaver makeup.
- I loved Manila.
I would have worn that dress.
Again, yes, I would have taken
off the carrot belt.
- Yeah.
- But, you know,
we all would've.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
I understand the silhouette.
I know what she was going for.
But the execution of it
wasn't fierce.
- The skirt looked like
the polyester bedspreads.
- Motel 6.
If you put a black light on it,
you'd run.
- Let's talk about Raja.
I was surprised about the
pantaloon storyline, you know.
- It happens.
I've been on red carpets.
And sometimes, you know,
you just--it happens.
I just think she is not to be
played with, and I like her.
- Now, Sara, do you think
that her Depends...
- Yeah?
- Cost her the top spot?
- It didn't bother me,
'cause it was such a--
it was so clearly, like,
"Whoops," you know,
she made a mistake.
- The reason why I said that the
makeup went a little bit spooky
is because I couldn't find
anything wrong with her.
Her cake was a piece of art.
- Carmen Carrera.
- Like, if we could pick
"from the neck up winner,"
she would be my winner.
- When somebody gets their
16-year-old a car at Christmas,
that's the bow that goes
on the top.
- Her face looked pretty.
Her hair looked pretty.
I loved the little tiara
that was on her head.
But was it lower-level
than the other ones?
Yes.
- Delta Work.
- She looked amazing
when she rounded the corner.
And then, as she stood there,
I saw more and more wrong
with the outfit.
- I thought, quite honestly,
she looked gorgeous tonight.
- Miss Shangela.
- If you still don't know how
to beat your face,
which is a huge part
of being a drag superstar,
then you're not ready.
- The other ones live
to be drag queens.
She stands out as one who does
not live to be a drag queen.
- It seemed to me tonight,
that there was, like, a lot
of raw talent there.
She just didn't quite know
what to do
'cause she doesn't quite have
the training.
- Well, then,
she shouldn't be here.
- Right.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your face of cakes
presentation on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia.
Your strawberry shortcake
was sweet as pie.
<i>Echa pa'lante.</i>
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Delta Work.
Your angel cake couture had
one too many layers.
But the overall effect
was heavenly.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Your red velvet cake
was hard to swallow
and not couture.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- It just pisses me off
that a lot of these bitches
look like shit.
But, you know, I wanted to do
something different.
Everybody's wearing
fucking dresses.
I should have made a dress
and called it a day
and been the fiercest bitch
onstage.
- Manila.
You doll cake was moist.
And I want another piece.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raja.
Even though you flashed
your knickers,
the judges couldn't stop
gushing over
your chocolate lava couture.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.
- Thank you so much.
This is my second time winning
a challenge.
And I think I deserved it.
Because I have a master's degree
in fierce.
I should be a professor.
- Carmen Carrera.
Your Jersey princess cake
couture did not hit the spot.
Alexis Mateo.
You're a sweet talker,
but your cheesecake couture
struck a sour note
with the judges.
Shangela.
You and a sewing machine
are a recipe for disaster.
Shangela, you're safe.
Is there anything you'd like
to say?
- I'm here
because I want to be here.
And I appreciate
what you see in me.
And I'm gonna continue
to show you
that not only
am I an entertainer,
but I am a drag queen.
And I'm meant to be here.
- Carmen Carrera.
Bada-bing, you're safe.
- Thank you, guys.
- Alexis Mateo.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I consider Stacy my friend
in this competition.
But if you give me the choice
between me and her leaving,
of course I'm gonna choose her.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
-<i> I didn't know what the judges</i>
<i>wanted to see.</i>
<i>I went to the high-energy road.</i>
<i>'Cause that's who I am.</i>
-<i> I'm not that great</i>
<i>of a dancer.</i>
<i>But this is a competition.</i>
<i>I do have a name, a reputation.</i>
<i>And I'm not just gonna stand</i>
<i>there</i>
<i>and just give up in a song.</i>
- Now, I'm no stranger to being
bald on the runway,
but Stacy is taking out track
by track by track.
It looks like a poodle just shed
all over the runway.
[applause]
- [laughing]
Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shantay, you stay.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
You've come a long way
from Back Swamp.
But from this moment on,
the world is watching.
Be proud, be a star.
But most of all, be a lady.
Now sashay away.
Thank you.
[applause]
- Love you.
- Stacy.
- I never thought that,
coming from a small town
in North Carolina,
that I would even be
in a place like this.
So, you know, it's amazing.
I'm just glad to have made it
this far.
I'm very proud of myself.
I'm happy with what I've done
and what I brought
to the competition.
Condragulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right.
Let the music play!

- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's drag race...</i>
Escandalo!
- Oh!
- Kristin, what's next?
- Manila Luzon,
you've perpetuated stereotypes.
Condragulations, you're the
winner of this challenge.
- I'm ready to show you
who Stacy is.
- Well, you said that
last week.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Shantay, you stay.
And tonight...
Oh, my goodness!
The competition heats up.
- Word.
- And the dolls get shady.
- I hate her!
I hate her!
- With extra special
guest judges
Aisha Tyler and Amber Rose.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup;
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails perfected
by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[tires screech]
- Oh, my goodness.
- [laughs]
- "Never give up.
You're all stars."
- I am so glad I am not the one
that went home.
Bye, girl.
- Stacy, put your back into it.
- Girl...
- [laughing]
- When I was on stage
for the elimination,
I was so mad at myself.
Girl, I felt like I was about to
walk the plank, honey.
- Yeah.
- It does.
- You know how Shangela said
you feel like you about to die?
- Yeah.
- Girl...
I feel like I could be doing
a whole lot better
in this competition.
I just feel like stuff keeps
coming back
and just knocking me down.
- God, Manila won
the challenge.
- Yeah.
- How sad is that?
- I thought she did
really good.
- You don't think it was, like,
a little bit risky
that she was making fun of
some--
- She was making fun
of a culture
that she looks to be a part of,
but she's not.
You know, it just made me
uncomfortable,
but the judges seemed
to enjoy that.
So hallelu.
- Girls, it's just like
Margaret Cho.
That's what I was going for.
You know, she makes fun of her
Asian mom all the time.
- But she is of that culture.
That's her mom.
- It's really no different than
you doing black, Southern lady.
- Well, but I'm black,
and I'm from the South.
- She is not acting.
She is.
- I think that the whole
conversation is bullshit.
If a black girl was asked to be
funny,
the first thing they
immediately do is get ghetto,
get country, and I love it.
What's the difference, really?
- Some of us were doing it
as drag queens.
- Well, no, I think
that everybody on that set was
doing drag.
It was just a different
interpretation.
- It's your interpretation
of it.
- Yeah.
No reason to get mad.
- I just don't want to talk
about it.
- What's going on?
- They're just making it all,
like, a race thing,
and it's not.
- It's so not.
I don't mean this to be
offensive,
but do you have nail polish?
- [laughing]
- No, I'm serious.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail!
Hey, hey, racers.
all: Hey!
- In the cosmos, there are
billions and billions of stars.
But the brightest ones are
right here in Hollywood.
Now, when it's your turn
in the spotlight,
will you sparkle, Neely,
sparkle...
or will you fall deep into
the Valley of the Dulls?
[laughing]
- [giggles]
She's so good.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hey!
- Hi, ladies. Wow.
For today's mini challenge,
we're gonna play
the new gaming sensation
that's sweeping the nation,
and it's called...
Shit RuPaul Says.
- Okay.
- Say it with me.
all: Shit RuPaul Says.
- [laughing]
One by one, letters will pop
onto the screen.
Now, if you think you know
the answer, hit your buzzer.
But be careful, because if
you're wrong, you're out.
The last queen standing will win
a phone call home.
- Oh!
- I almost started to tear up,
because I immediately think,
"Oh, my god, I have the
opportunity to call my grandma."
- Are you ready to play?
all: Yes!
- When I call your names,
swish on down.
Yara Sofia, swish on down!
[laughing]
- I would love to call my mom.
She's gonna be so excited.
She's gonna be like,
"Are you eating?"
- Delta Work, swish on down!
[laughing]
Carmen Carrera, swish on down!
[laughing]
All right, so let's go
to the puzzle.
This puzzle is Shit RuPaul Eats.
[laughter]
Let's go.
[clock ticking]
[bell rings]
Delta.
- Two piece and a biscuit.
- Oh, my goodness!
[cheers and applause]
Condragulations, Delta Work!
This next puzzle
is Shit RuPaul Says.
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you know.
[bell rings]
Raja, what is your answer?
- Eleganza extravaganza!
- Oh!
- Raja is right!
All right, the last three queens
to play.
This round
is Shit RuPaul Plugs.
- Oh.
- Oh, dear.
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you think you know
the answer.
[bell rings]
All right, Shangela.
What is your answer?
- Available on...iTunes.
- That is correct!
Condragulations, Shangela.
- Word!
- All right, Delta and Raja,
whoever wins this round
will be the winner
of the mini challenge.
This puzzle is
Ghetto Shit RuPaul Says.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you think you know
the answer.
No answers yet.
[bell rings]
All right.
Delta Work,
what do you have?
- She done already done had
herses.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Whoo!
- Yeah, she done already done
had herses!
Delta, you win!
[cheers and applause]
You've won yourself
a phone call home.
Ladies, I hope your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
are all warmed up,
because for this week's
main challenge,
you're going to be guest stars
on a game show
we like to call...
Snatch Game!
[cheers and applause]
This is your chance to bring
to life
your best celebrity
impersonations.
Bottom line, you need to be
an entertainer
who really entertains.
I'll be back a little later to
check on your progress.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best Cher win,
okay?
- I remember Shangela saying,
"Oh, I would call
my grandmother,
and I would love
to just check up on her."
And I thought to myself,
"I don't need the phone call
right now."
Well, listen, the more I hear
about your grandmother
and, like, how she's kind of
on her own,
the phone call would be
better used by you, I think.
- Oh, my god!
- You want it?
- It was a really sincere gift
that was so unselfish of her.
It touched me.
- So what you doing?
- Child, miss,
I'm Joan Crawford.
- Oh, work.
Do you ever do, like,
impersonations?
- Oh, bitch, I got this nailed.
I am Joan Crawford.
Yes.
- I'm debating between
Anna Nicole and Fran Drescher.
- I don't even know.
Who is that?
- Fran Drescher.
- You are doing Tina?
- Nico-Tina Turner.
She's doing Nico-Tina.
I'm doing Alicia Keys.
- Okay, I think I've decided
on it.
- What have you decided on?
- Anna Nicole.
- Girl, you're being
a bit flip-floppy.
- I've decided
I'm gonna do Anna Nicole
because she loves pink;
I love pink myself.
Should I make
a silver and pink dress?
- W-w-a-n-d.
What would Anna Nicole do?
I love my girl Stacy.
But I don't feel that she's
completely confident
in what she's saying.
So I'm wondering, "Is she gonna
be able to pull this off?"
- Today we're doing
the Snatch Game,
celebrity impersonation.
- I'm a little concerned
about my character,
'cause I don't think
Alicia Keys is funny.
- So how are you gonna
combat that?
- I'll do my best, honey.
- So, um, what are you
gonna do?
- Um, I'm gonna do
Imelda Marcos.
- Yay!
- After all this, like, Asian
accent talk this morning,
I think that I'm gonna go out
on a limb
and do another Asian accent.
I'm going to be showing a lot of
my Filipino pride.
[door squeaking open]
- Hello, lady-kins!
- Hi!
- Hi, Ru!
- Hey, Delta.
What you have here?
- I am doing Cher.
- What?
- I know.
- I happen to know she's a fan
of this show.
- Oh, wow.
- You know
she'll be watching this.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah, no pressure.
Every queen in the world is
gonna be watching this,
and everyone
who's ever done Cher
is gonna be watching this.
- Sure.
- So you have to represent.
- I can certainly try.
- Hey, Raja.
- Hi, Ru.
- Who do we have here?
- I'm doing Tyra.
- Now, didn't she win the last
<i>RuPaul Drag Race?</i>
- No, not the other Tyra,
the actual Tyra.
- [giggles]
- I wanted to do her
'cause this is someone
that I know firsthand,
and I've been in the same room
with all of her Tyra-isms.
Sometimes she's, like,
quite proper
and she seems really educated,
and then she'll just like,
"Hey!"
You know, "Mm-hmm!"
- Tyra-ize them, hunty.
- Honey, word!
Uh!
- [laughs]
Yara Sofia.
- Hi.
- Hola, mami.
- Hola.
- Who do we have here?
- Amy Winehouse.
- You're from Puerto Rico.
- Yes.
- She's from England.
- England.
- How are you gonna do that?
[laughs]
- Well, I've been watching
Hatty Potter, so probably--
- Harry Potter?
- Hatty Potter, yeah.
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.
[both laughing]
- [with not an English accent]
Can I have some water?
- [laughs]
- How'd it sound?
- By George,
I think you've got it!
- Really?
- Yes.
All right, darling,
I'm gonna go this way.
Carmen Carrera.
- Hi, my love.
- Look at that face.
It's beat down.
Now, I see that you have padded
your already fat ass even more.
Stand up.
Let me take a look.
Are you doing J.Lo?
- I am.
- You are doing J.Lo?
- Yeah.
- You know that you are sitting
behind a desk?
- Well, I asked for a throne,
so I'm just hoping that
I have that when I get there,
'cause I'm gonna be
really upset,
and I'm gonna have to call
somebody.
- Yes, thank you very much,
Jennifer.
And I will see you on the set.
- Yes.
- All right, see you
in a minute.
- Thank you.
- Alexis Mateo.
- Hi, Ru.
- I know exactly who this is.
- Who is it?
- It's Alicia Keys.
- Oh, you got it right.
- How are you gonna make
Alicia Keys funny?
- I'm gonna be a pregnant, butch
Alicia Keys.
- [giggles]
Well,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.
I see a blonde wig.
Dolly Parton?
- Anna Nicole.
- How are you gonna convey
Anna Nicole Smith?
- The fabulous shoes
with the pink on them.
- Oh, okay.
- With my purse.
- So you're gonna rely on your
purse and your shoes?
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm not sold.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, because you know
you were in the bottom two
last week.
- Yes.
- What are you gonna do to
ensure
you won't be there again
this week?
- I'm gonna give everything
I have, because--
- Well, you said that last time,
giving everything.
It's got to be more than just,
"I'm gonna give
everything I have."
- I'm gonna bring
something new.
- You got to bring it, baby.
- I will.
- I'm rooting for you,
Stacy Matthews.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, baby.
And they call this queen Mariah.
- Howdy do?
- Oh, my go--am I feeling
a little Joan Crawford here?
- Yes.
- I love it!
- Okay, she was such a bitch,
and I love her.
- Well, it's funny you're doing
Joan Crawford,
because a lot of the criticism
you've gotten
on the main stage
are all the things
that Joan Crawford is not.
She's strong. She's powerful.
She's concise.
- I'm very much Joan Crawford.
I don't think that on the runway
I've never given anything
but confidence and strength
and poise and elegance.
- Mariah, will you walk me
to my car?
[giggles]
All right, ladies,
gather around.
Today's Snatch Game contestants
are sexy celebrities
in their own right.
Model and red carpet phenomenon
Amber Rose is here.
[applause]
- Oh, my god, what?
Amber Rose?
I love Amber Rose.
- And one of my favorites,
actress and comedienne
Aisha Tyler will be here.
- Oh, wow.
- Amber and Aisha are also
your guest judges this week.
all: Ooh.
- Yes.
Ladies, the game is on.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
All right, see you later.
- Bye, Ru.
- I just want to punch a wall.
Why am I here?
Why am I here?
I feel like this is the lowest
point in the whole competition.
Whatever.
- What are you over?
- Well, she keeps bringing
the god damn bullshit up.
I can't...
- What do you mean?
- "Well, you said that
last week."
Don't keep bringing that up.
That's not helping me.
- Stacy, maybe that is trying
to help you.
- But it's not.
- But that's what I'm saying,
is maybe she's trying
to give you a heads-up.
I know how you feel.
But if she gave you
that recommendation
of she's not feeling it,
I would come up
with something else.
Who else--who else
is pop culture right now
that you can do?
- What about Mo'nique?
- Mo'nique.
Do fucking Mo'nique.
- [sighs]
- Don't get frustrated.
Let's do this.
- I don't want to give up,
because this is a dream for me.
I don't want to go
the fuck home.
- Hello, and welcome
to the new Snatch Game.
I'm your host, RuPaul.
Now let's meet our first
contestant.
She's a model from South Philly.
Please welcome Amber Rose.
- Hi.
- Up next, she's a talented
actress and comedienne.
Please welcome Aisha Tyler.
Hello, Aisha.
- Hello.
- And let's give
a Hollywood hello
to our star-studded celebrity
panel.
Well, hello, Cher.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Well, you know, I don't know
what the hell I'm doing here.
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.
- [laughing]
And next to her, we have
the former first lady
of the Philippines.
Imelda Marcos is with us.
- Mabuhay, mabuhay!
- At least this time, she picked
a Filipino.
- Of course, next to her, we
have media mogul and supermodel
Tyra Banks is in the house.
Hello, Tyra.
- Hey, Ru.
- Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.
What do they call that?
- Smizing.
- [laughing]
- Next to her, we have Academy
Award winner Mo'nique.
Mo'nique, is everything...
- Precious!
- Uh-oh, is Precious
back there?
- Mm-hmm, she better be
cooking me something to eat.
- [laughing]
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
With us
is the fantastic Tina Turner.
Hello, Tina.
- All right, RuPaul.
- Are you gonna be nice or
rough on the Snatch Game?
- I always do it rough.
- [laughing]
- Next to her is the late, great
Joan Crawford.
Now, that is not a wire hanger.
- It's not.
- What is it?
- It's a wooden hanger.
- Mariah's Joan Crawford,
I think it's a little crunchy,
and I don't think Joan
would ever allow herself
to look that bad.
- Next to her, of course, is
Grammy winner Alicia Keys.
- Ooh, ooh!
New York!
Now, Alicia, a little birdie
tells me
that you got a secret
to tell us.
- Yo, I am pregnant,
and I am fierce, ah!
- All right, next to her
is the incomparable--
Jennifer Lopez is with us.
And, honey, I got your rider.
- Yeah, compliment, compliment,
question.
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.
- Next to her is England's
gorgeous rock superstar
Amy Winehouse.
Hey, Amy.
- Hi, how are you?
- [laughing]
- I think this is your first
game show in America.
Have you done game shows
in England?
- Yes, yes.
[garbled speech] Once.
Um, I have...
- Yes.
All right, Amber, Aisha, I will
ask a series of questions,
and our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.
You give an answer you think
will match theirs.
Are you ready to snatch
the stars?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.
- Starting with Aisha.
Crazy Daisy is so crazy, she
thinks a Kardashian is a...
- Country in Africa.
- That's a very good answer.
Let's see if you got any matches
up here.
Oh, you've got more shoes,
Imelda.
- These ones have sparkles
on here.
It match your outfit.
- Did you write down
your answer? Good, good.
- Designer shoe?
- Not a match
but a very good answer.
All right, Tyra.
- I only have one answer
in my hand.
And this answer
is the only answer.
Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!
I hate her. I hate her.
I hate her!
She ruined my life!
- [laughing]
- Smizing.
- All right, Mo'nique.
- Yeah?
- No, it's cool. It's cool.
We cool, Mo'nique.
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.
All right, let's go to the great
Joan Crawford.
- My eyebrows.
- "My eyebrows."
- That was almost...
nothing like what I put down,
but...
- All right, let's go
to Amy Winehouse.
Crazy Daisy thinks a Kardashian
is a...
- Lubricant remover.
- Lubricant remover.
- That's a great answer,
actually.
- It is a great answer.
Unfortunately, Aisha,
it's not a match.
Up next, Amber Rose.
Psycho Sally is so psycho,
instead of kissing her dates
good night, she blanks them.
- She stabs them.
- Let's start with Cher.
Instead of kissing her dates
good night...
- She buys them tickets
to my never-ending tour.
- Not a match.
All right, Tyra Banks.
- That answer is "smizes."
- She smizes them.
- And Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!
- [laughing]
Tita Turter, what do you have?
- She sends them rollin' down
the river.
All right.
- All right, Joan Crawford,
Psycho Sally...
- She cuts their rose bushes.
- No, unfortunately, that is
not a match.
- Mariah could've given us
a little bit more drama.
You always remember
the shrieking kind of--
you know, that intensity
from Joan Crawford
and especially
in<i> Mommie Dearest.</i>
It would've been nice to see
a little bit more
of that extremity.
- Alicia Keys, let's see
if you match Amber Rose.
- I match you, Amber.
- Yes.
- Completely.
- Psycho Sally, what does she
do with her dates?
- She give them the number.
Call me, baby.
I'm just waiting for you.
- [laughing]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jennifer Lopez.
Now, Psycho Sally is so psycho,
instead of kissing her dates
good night...
- She actually marries them to
promote her next album.
- Oh, that's what she does.
Now, Aisha, Freaky Fanny
is so freaky,
instead of shaking hands,
she shakes...
- Schlongs.
- Schlongs.
- Trips off the tongue.
- What'd you got, Cher?
- It's not a match.
- Not a match.
- She shakes with age.
- See, that would never happen
to you, doll.
- Never.
- Never, never, never.
Mo'nique.
Freaky Fanny is so freaky,
instead of shaking hands,
she shakes...
- A chicken leg in my face,
'cause the bitch know
I'm hungry.
Bitch know it.
I'm hungry as hell.
- We'll see you about
getting you some food
over here, all right.
Let's go to the great
Joan Crawford.
- Since I lost Barbara,
could we get Mo'nique to come
and be my new housekeeper?
- Well, you're both
Academy Award winners.
- Fuck that skinny bitch.
- Okay, all right, all right.
Now, Joan, what do you have,
darling?
- Shake the shit
out of Christina.
- Aw.
Not a match.
Tyra, is there anything going on
that you want to tell us about?
- What?
- Are you smizing too hard?
- I think I've smized so hard,
my eyes bled, girl.
- Oh, my goodness!
She's smizing her head off
over there.
But you still look gorgeous.
- Thanks, girl.
Word.
Peeeeeace!
- All right, next round.
Dirty Diana is so dirty,
she washes her weave with...
- Lysol.
- With Lysol.
'Cause she's dirty.
- Yeah.
- All right, we'll go directly
to the Philippines
and Imelda Marcos.
- Don't cry for me,
Filipinos.
- Yes, darling, yes.
Dirty Diana is so dirty, she
washes her weaves with...
- Sweat from my feet.
- Sweat from your feet.
- Oh, 'cause of wearing
all these shoes!
- Yes, they must sweat
terribly.
- All right, Tita Turter.
- You want to know one thing?
- Yes, I want to know.
- You want to know why?
- I want to know why.
- Love.
- Love. What's love
got to do with it?
- Don't--no, no, no.
Mm-mm, can't do it.
- All right, keep it real,
Tina.
- All right, real.
I'm a long way from Nutbush, Ru.
Hallelu.
- [laughs]
- That is maybe the worst
Tina Turner I have ever seen.
She was like, "I...
"I don't know, like, hallelu.
"What's love got to do with it?
Hallelu."
- All right, Alicia Keys!
- She got her number, yeah.
- I'm writing a new song.
It's called<i> Amber.</i>
- Amber, okay.
- Yes.
- I think there should be an
Amber Alert out for Alicia Keys.
All right, Dirty Diana is so
damn dirty, girl.
- Mm-hmm.
- She wash her weaves
with what?
- Dush?
- With douche.
- With a douche.
- With a douch--
- Oh, that's the hood spelling.
- That's the hood, baby.
- She meant to write "douche,"
but she write "dush."
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Unfortunately, we have run
out of time.
Amber, Aisha,
the final score is...
Who cares?
On behalf of all our stars,
thank you for joining us
on the new Snatch Game!
Good-bye, everybody!
See you next time.
[applause]
- I haven't been able to talk
to my grandma
since I came
into this competition.
[phone line rings]
And we talk, like, every day.
- Hi.
- Hey, Grandma, it's me, DJ.
We were raised in a Southern
Baptist lifestyle.
And I know that it was
a big shift to go,
"Oh, my god, my grandson's
a drag queen now."
But my gram loves me.
She's been one of my biggest
supporters.
- Just have to keep going.
Just don't give up.
- No, I'm not gonna give up.
I promise that.
- Okay.
- Today when I'm talking
with her on the phone,
it just reinspires me
for this competition.
I don't want to let her down.
- Good morning.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- So we're back in the workroom,
and the look for today
on the runaway
is to look fabulous
in our favorite drag.
But not everyone is at the most
confident right now.
- Is this what you wear usually?
- Uh-huh.
- God, I'm swimming in it.
It's so huge.
Squeezing the gas out of me.
- Well, imagine
this is what I wear.
- This is why you fart so much.
- This is, like, what?
A twenty--
Oh, this is a 34.
- Oh! No.
A 34 in where?
This better be 34 in Europe.
- Yeah, this is my
best friend right here.
And my mom's on the other wall
over there.
- What about your dad?
- Passed away.
- When?
- About two years ago.
I was mad at him
most of my life.
Just being on drugs so much
and, like, stealing.
And he was on crack, basically.
- Right.
I'm starting to understand
a lot more
of why Stacy
is the way Stacy is.
- The way I was raised
and the way I grew up,
having to deal with my dad,
I feel like it made me nervous.
Like, I have panic attacks.
But, you know, I've learned
to control 'em.
I feel like me and Shangela
have grown so close
in this competition.
I can open up to her and share
pretty much anything.
And we fall out.
- Oh!
She's like my sister.
[upbeat music]
- Mariah?
- Help.
Look, look, look, look,
look, look, look.
Help.
- Come on, barbershop.
- It's just the story
of Shangela.
She's got all personality,
but how much skill
does she have
as someone who can, you know,
put herself together?
She always has somebody
helping her out.
She's got her little minions
over there.
- Clearly, there's two cliques
going on,
and one of the cliques
is Shangela's handmaidens.
She look like Tina Turner
after Ike beat her down.
- These conniving bitches are
talking about my sister, honey.
And so of course I'm gonna go
tell her, honey.
- Who?
- The clique.
- Initially, I thought,
"Well, I'm gonna go over
and find out what they're saying
about me."
But, honestly,
what will that change?
When people are talking
about you,
that means
you're doing something right.
This hair is not soundproof.
- If she hears it,
then she hears it.
I don't have to scream it
out loud,
but I will use my normal tone
of voice,
and I will let her know that
"you know what?
Do it yourself."
- Just so you know, Cousin It
can still hear you.
- What makes a good
impersonator,
and what makes a good female
illusionist?
- Carmen, you should've asked
this question yesterday.
- Right.
Maybe I should've thought of
y'all answers yesterday.
- Don't be a jerk!
Such a jerk.
- Sorry.
- I remember my elementary
school teacher
called me a jerk one time.
- Really?
- I called her a heifer.
I grew up in Gainesville,
Georgia.
It was not the easiest
experience.
No, I pretty much was picked on
for one reason or another.
Either I sounded too white
or I wasn't black enough.
I just didn't fit in.
I just knew I needed to get
where I had a lot more
opportunity.
And I stumbled into the world
of drag.
Girl, I'm gonna get my life.
And if the arrow goes real high,
hooray for you.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
And what?
[applause]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle.
- Hey, baby!
- Santino.
- Hey, Ru, I missed you.
- I wrote you letters.
Did you not get them?
- [chuckles]
- Amber Rose.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Thank you for having me.
- Aisha Tyler.
- Ru, Ru, yoo-hoo.
- This week,
we challenged our girls
to do their best celebrity
impressions.
Tonight they've come
to the main stage
wearing their favorite
drag looks.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
It looks like she's going back
to her roots.
- I love the dark, wicked
bitch look.
I feel so powerful.
- Very Gaultier.
- It is Gaga Gaultier.
- Shangela.
- Oh, and the reveal.
What?
- I picked out this beautiful,
cream-colored structure gown--
design couture.
- First time
you see a black woman
whose hair can provide shelter
from the rain.
- Can you save me a slice of
that hair pie?
They call this queen Mariah.
- Her legs are amazing.
- Gorgeous legs.
- I am a wild animal
on the runway.
I stalk my prey, I hunt,
and I pounce.
- Let me just say,
as a black woman,
I have a very flat ass.
And now I know
where it all went.
- It all went to Mariah.
She took it all.
Raja.
- Two tribes go to war.
- That's right.
Shaka Zulu, honey.
- The look I've chosen
is quite global,
just kind of<i> </i>
<i>National Geographic</i><span style="bodyStyle"> drag.</i>
Apocalypto Amazon gal.
- She served you up
on the Serengeti.
- Girl, the natives are
restless.
Alexis Mateo.
- Quinceañera.
- This, by the way,
is one of the real housewives
of Puerto Rico.
- I am wearing a creation from
one of my friends,
and I just feel like a princess.
- It makes me hungry
for some sherbet.
Carmen Carrera.
She's at the cabana by the pool
serving glamour.
- I'm feeling like a supermodel
on the runway right now.
My head held high
and just kind of, like,
letting the chiffon blow
behind me.
- Look at that chassis.
- And look at the
undercarriage.
- She's one fierce
mother tucker.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Formerly Stacy Layne Bryant,
but she got married.
- This gold coat is my
signature piece.
I'm feeling very confident
in what I'm wearing.
Stacy Matthews has arrived.
- This face is just popping.
- See, now, Mo'nique should have
worn this to the Oscars.
Delta Work.
- Got to love a pantsuit.
- Ann-Margret.
- Ann-Margret...
after the buffet.
- On the runway, I'm feeling
confident today.
I feel great.
I love my outfit.
- That red hair is so gorgeous
on her.
- Delta, you better wooooork!
- Manila.
- Very Twiggy.
- That must be
the Filipino flag.
- I'm getting pinay fish
in this really, really, really
cute Filipino flag dress.
- Filipino couture.
- From the house of Imelda.
- All right, ladies.
Fun and games are over.
When I call your name,
step forward.
Raja.
Stacy.
Alexis.
You are the top three.
Yara.
Delta.
Mariah.
You...
are the bottom three.
Carmen. Shangela. Manila.
You three are safe.
And "safe" is a word
that I have come to loathe
in this competition.
Moving forward, I want you to
make bold choices
worthy of America's next
drag superstar.
You three may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent the
best and the worst of the week.
It's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raja.
- All I have to say is...
[clicking tongue]
- Well, fuck you too.
[laughter]
- You bring it to the runway
every time.
And I love this global warrior
princess you've got going on.
And as far as your Tyra Banks, I
laughed out loud several times.
- I thought because
you know her so well,
you could've done so much more,
because she is a human
caricature.
- I loved
your runway look today.
I thought that it was bold,
drama.
You know, it really felt
editorial.
It really felt high fashion.
And that was really exciting
to see.
- Thank you, Raja.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I loved your Alicia Keys.
You killed that.
It was so, so funny.
- I love the color,
and I love the bling on it.
You look like a real housewife
of Dubai.
- I love gaudy things,
and that's very gaudy
and sparkly and glamorous.
And I think you look great.
And the fact that you were
flirting with me was a plus.
And I was like, "Damn, I'm gonna
get some Alicia tonight."
[laughter]
- Stacy.
You told me that you were going
to be Anna Nicole Smith.
What had happened?
- I feel like I'm relating more
to Mo'nique,
so that's why I switched.
- You stayed physically
in that character.
Your facial expression
was completely different.
You know, you had the--
yeah, and you held it, mama.
You never fell out.
Look at--
[laughter]
- You're so beautiful.
I mean, you're representing
the big girls,
and you're doing a great job.
I mean, you have, like, breasts,
and it looks amazing.
You look so good.
Like, wow.
- I'm so proud of you tonight,
Stacy.
You stepped it up this week.
You need to now realize
that you can't go back.
- Yep.
- All right, thank you, Stacy.
Raja, Alexis, Stacy...
you may leave the stage.
Yara Sofia.
Let's start with you.
Aisha?
- I loved your look today.
I thought it was really
original.
It was really exciting.
That being said, I struggled
a little bit
with your Amy Winehouse.
I could not understand the
accent that you were doing.
I was like, "Is she German?"
- I'm totally into your
dark, wicked bitch look
that you got going on.
I like your own brand
of what you're bringing
to this competition.
- Because Amy is such a big
character, we want more.
You have it.
Give it all.
- I will. I will.
- Next up, Mariah.
How'd you feel
walking the runway?
- Frankly, I'm surprised to be
down here.
I definitely believe that
there's someone more qualified
to be in my position right now.
- Who?
- Carmen Carrera.
She played a bitchy version of
herself.
If I wanted to be offensive,
I could play a knock-off
Filipino.
But I'm not a judge, so--
- I'll speak for myself.
You know,
being a Joan Crawford fan,
I was so happy that you chose
to do that role.
I was disappointed, though,
that there were a lot of missed
opportunities with punch lines.
Were you happy with your
performance?
- I was--I was--I was pleased
with my performance, yes, ma'am.
- All right.
Next up, Delta.
- If you're gonna be a queen
and you're gonna deliver Cher,
bitch, you better deliver Cher.
You were shy Cher.
- There are so many Cher-isms,
and I didn't want to rely
on what you've seen.
And I thought what I would do
was amp it up,
and I didn't turn the knob
completely.
- Delta, what's going on?
Why are you holding back?
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Okay, just between us girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Raja.
- Raja on the runway was,
for me,
far and away, the top dog today.
- Being that she has worked
with Tyra,
she could have made it
a little more irreverent.
- But then Tyra would have sued
the shit out of us.
[laughter]
Let's talk about Alexis.
- Her Alicia
was fully realized,
not just the voice
but the look, the physicality,
the jokes.
It was like
your granddaddy's boat;
it was tightened up.
- I'm kind of stuck with Alexis.
- Really?
- 'Cause I feel like
she's stuck.
I feel like we're seeing the
same thing in different colors.
- But she killed Alicia Keys,
in a good way.
- Well, let's move on
to Mo'nique.
- She was funny even when
she didn't speak.
She really was in that character
at all times.
- As far as the runway goes,
really?
Your favorite drag look are
those pants,
which happen to be--
you know, she's hanging
with her besties,
Poly and Esther.
- Yara Sofia.
- Obviously, the accent
did not work.
- In the beginning,
it was funny.
Then it got, like, really dry
and not in a good way.
- But she made brave choices
on the runway.
The dreads were off the hook.
That face makeup was what-what.
- Miss Mariah.
- I don't understand
the black cheeks.
- It was Lily Munster.
- It was!
That wasn't Joan Crawford.
She would never go out without
blending all that in.
- It was a really bad
Joan Crawford.
There was just so much
that she didn't do.
- Well, it's been her criticism
before
that she sort of fakes her way
to the middle.
- She could sleep her way to
the top.
- Even when you get to the top,
you're gonna have to have
something to deliver.
Delta Work.
- It's Cher. You learn that
in Drag School 101.
- You need to have
that confidence.
When you walk into a room,
it's like, "Honey, I'm here,
and I'm Cher."
She didn't do that.
- I just want to say to Delta,
"Schnap out of it!"
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Tina!
Bring me the axe.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your performance
in the Snatch Game
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Raja...
your impersonation of Tyra Banks
smizing
brought tears to my eyes.
You're safe.
Alexis Mateo.
No one, no one, no one
can do Alicia Keys like you.
You're safe.
- Stacy, I had all but given up
on you.
But you played
to your strengths,
and you came out on top.
Isn't that precious?
- Yes.
- Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge.
[applause]
And you've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas
from ALandCHUCK.travel.
- After being in the bottom
and all these bitches
talking shit,
saying, "Stacy Matthews,
why are you here?"
Fuck those bitches, honey.
- However,
you will not be immune
from elimination next week.
From this point forward, no one
will receive immunity.
Ladies, make every moment count.
Mariah...
your impersonation
of Joan Crawford
was not Mildred Fierce.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Being bottom two,
I didn't realize
how emotional it could be.
It's definitely intense.
- Yara Sofia.
Playing a mess does not give you
permission to be messy.
Delta Work,
your impersonation of Cher
didn't make any of us believe.
I'm sorry, Delta, but you are up
for elimination.
- To see Stacy win
and I'm in the bottom two
was, just, like, the travesty
that's gonna go down
in, like, history as WTF.
- Yara, you may join
the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- Even though Mariah's really
serving it,
Mariah doesn't know her words
too well.
But Delta's hitting, like,
every word.
Mariah's just, like, there,
like...
- I knew most of the words to
the lip-sync song,
but there was some gaps, so
I'm gonna make up something.
Fill in the gaps, bitch, with
"elephant shoe," honey,
"cantaloupe,"
and "sha-laba-laba-tuna."
- Yes!
[cheers and applause]
- Yes!
- Ladies...
I have made my decision.
Delta Work...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you
for the second chance.
- My beautiful queen.
This is not the end.
This is the emancipation
of Mariah.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you.
[applause]
I'm feeling entertained.
Their judgment was interesting.
It wouldn't have mattered if I'd
have done anything differently.
You play the game and then go.
It's gonna be hell
getting the bags back home.
- Condragulations, ladies.
You are all one step closer
to becoming America's next
drag superstar.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
let the music play!
[RuPaul's<i> Main Event]</i>
- RuPaul's menswear provided
by Moods of Norway.
Grand prize contributed
in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.


- Previously on<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race...</i>
I'm gonna give you an
opportunity to really wig out.
- Yes, Rainbow Brite.
- She-man the barbarian.
- A little new school Mae West.
- How much is that poodle on
the runway?
Yara Sofia.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shantay, you stay.
Shangela,
sashay away.
Michelle.
I want you to confer with
Santino and Billy B.
To decide which
of the eliminated queens
deserve to return.
<i>And tonight...</i>
I want you to to meet
some real athletes.
- Come on in.
Whoo!
- It smells like testosterone.
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>Sharon Osbourne</i>
<i>and Margaret Cho.</i>
- All: Whoo!
-<i> The winner of RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race will receive,</i>
<i>a lifetime supply of Kryolan</i>
<i>Professional Make-up...</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected,</i>
<i>by Absolut...</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Pffft!
- No hair, no hair.
- Hello!
- Aw, it's a message from
Shangela.
We're back into the work room
today,
and Shangela is gone.
I'm gonna miss Shangela.
- Halleloo, Shangela.
- I'm gonna wipe it up.
- While you do that,
I'm gonna do one of these.
Woo-hoo!
- [laughing]
- Shangela's gone.
Good God, I feel like
the sky has parted.
I feel like I can frolic
through the woods
and perch a little bird
on my finger.
Sorry about it, Shangela.
- We are the top four.
- Not so much.
- When Ru said last week
on the runway
that another queen
is coming back,
I felt like, "All right,
we're top five again."
- Who do you think is coming?
- Um, I don't know.
- It could be Stacy.
Nah.
Mimi Imfurst.
- Oh, I hope not.
- Nah.
[alarm sounds]
-<i> Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
<i>Is the next drag superstar</i>
a catcher or a pitcher?<i> </i>
- Ooh.
-<i> Does she have a tight end</i>
or a fullback?
Well, get ready
for a little one-on-one,
man-to-man action.
<i>And remember...</i>
<i>if you can't be an athlete,</i>
you can at least be
an athletic supporter.
- Aah!
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru!
- What's up, Ru?
- Boy, oh, boy.
Now as you know,
I gave the judges
a one-time opportunity
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens
if they could come to
a unanimous decision.
So...
let's see which queen,
if any,
is behind that door.
The moment of truth is upon us.
- I can't,
I don't wanna look.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm back, bitches.
- Whoo!
- It's a heather,
it's a heather.
- The Jersey girl is back.
- It's fucking Carmen.
- Carmen Carrera.
- Hey.
- Now is your head
back in the game?
- Yes.
I'm really happy that, you know,
the judges wanted me
to come back.
Like, that makes me feel
even more confident.
I feel like
I have to bring it now.
- Now for today's
mini-challenge,
we'll be headed outside...
to the padunkadunk
dunking machine.
[cheering]
- Oh!
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Now each of you
will get a turn
to dunk the queen
of your choice.
- Carmen.
- Carmen.
- Carmen.
Carmen three times, honey.
- The doll who dunks her victim
the most times
in two minutes, wins.
So put your suits on
and I'll meet you out there.
All right, ladies.
Raja, you throw first.
Choose your victim.
- Carmen.
- [laughing]
- On your mark,
get set...
padunkadunk!
- Go Raja.
- Go Raja, go!
- Raja, Raja!
- No, no, no, no!
- I have a feeling
Carmen's used to
having balls thrown at her face.
- So I'm sitting there
and I'm a little nervous.
I'm, like, "Damn,
she's gonna get me."
But she throws like a girl.
I mean, come on, miss thing.
[laughter]
[buzzer buzzes]
- Time's up.
All right, Alexis?
- Yes.
- Choose your victim.
- Yara.
- Ay!
Oh, ho, ho, hmm...
No, no, no, no!
- Get her, get her!
- All: Ooh!
- [screaming]
- Oh!
- Damn!
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck you!
[laughter]
- Bam, bitch!
Get it!
- Yara, you're up next.
Who do you pick
to be your victim?
- I don't know,
but I think Alexis.
- Alexis?
- Oh!
- Now, darling,
it's my turn.
- This is the revenge of Yara.
And go.
- Work it, Yara!
- Get her, get her!
- [laughing]
- Taste that water, darling!
Taste it!
- Oh! Oh!
- [laughing]
[buzzer buzzes]
- Time's up.
You got seven.
- Yes.
- Condragulations.
- Thank you.
- Up next is Manila.
- Let's go up there, honey.
- Yes!
- No!
- My bitch.
- I just got warm, and now I
have to get back in that bitch.
- Ah!
- No!
- Stay behind that line.
- Come on, Manila,
you can do this, girl!
- Missed!
- Aaah!
- Carmen's getting pretty dry
up there.
- Thank goodness,
Manila sucks.
- No!
- All: Oh!
[buzzer buzzes]
- Up next, of course, is...
Carmen, hmmm.
- I think I'm gonna
have to choose Raja.
- No!
- Yeah!
- I want her to gag.
- Dunk her ass
like a donut, okay?
- Nooo!
- Aah!
- [laughing]
- Raja!
- [laughing]
- All: Whoo!
- The harder you throw,
the more you look like a dude,
okay?
That's all I'm saying.
- Oh, my God!
[buzzer buzzes]
- Oh, time's up, time's up.
All right, ladies.
With a total of 14 dunks,
the star pitcher
of RuPaul's Pink Sox is...
Alexis Rodriguez Mateo!
Condragulations, Alexis.
Now you kids go dry off
and I'll see you back in the
you-better-work room.
See you in a minute.
- Bye!
- Bye, Ru!
- Okay, kids.
Now that you're all warmed up,
I want you to meet
some real athletes.
- Oh, shit!
- Whoo!
- Hey!
- Come on in, babies.
Come on in.
Whoo!
- There's five guys
coming into the work room
and it smells like testosterone.
- For this week's
main challenge,
you'll be transforming these
straight jocks
into drag queens for a day.
- Oh, my God!
- [laughing]
Now using your own drag,
hair from Wig USA,
and other materials
we've provided,
I expect to see
a strong family resemblance.
Think of them as the Venus
to your Serena.
Gentlemen,
please introduce yourselves
and tell us your sport.
- Hi, I'm Matt.
I'm 29, and I play baseball...
hard.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Sorry about it.
- I'm Drew, I'm 23,
and I play rugby.
- My name is Slava, I'm 23,
and I play water polo.
- Hi, I'm Chevy, I'm 27,
I play baseball.
- My name's Christopher,
I'm 32,
I play basketball
from San Antonio, Texas.
- Yes.
- And yes, everything is bigger
in Texas.
- Now, Alexis, since you
won the mini-challenge,
you get to pair up
the guys and dolls.
- Heh, heh.
I love this part.
Come with me.
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Raja, meet your partner.
- Hey, my baby.
Come to mama.
- Manila, meet your partner.
- Hey!
- Bam!
You, come on.
Heh, heh, heh.
Yara.
- Oh!
Thank you, darling.
- Carmen.
Meet your partner.
With Chevy's body,
it's going to be very difficult
for Carmen
to stand on stage
naked like her.
And you're mine, yay.
I keep the best one for me.
Slava.
- Now turning these jocks
into drag queens
will take every ounce
of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent
that you've got.
So put some muscle into it.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Yeah!
- Can I hit one out there?
- Nope, no baseball.
No sports today,
you're a lady.
- Yes.
- Oh, really? Doesn't matter.
- [laughing] Yeah.
- Sell it.
Hands on your hips,
hands on your hips, always.
- Hands on my hips.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Hands on my hips.
I'm liking this shit.
- Yeah, you have, like,
a boner a little bit.
- It's a little one?
I think it's 'cause
the air is in there.
[laughing]
- I was like, "Okay, kill it."
It's not the first time
I got a straight guy excited.
- [laughing]
- Oh!
- So the challenge today is
we have to transform
these straight jocks
into our drag sisters.
- Yeah, those are gonna be
your tits.
- [laughing]
- I hope so.
It's like water polo.
- [gasping] You have to shave.
- I'm not shaving that.
That's my jungle hair over here.
- Drew, he's afraid
of what are we going to do.
- I have to be a jock
for a second.
- So now you're gonna play.
- Yes, I just--
I'll work a little,
and I'll play a little,
you know?
- I have a lot of work to do.
- Carmen, are we gonna have to
teach these boys how to tuck?
- I have to.
- Have you ever put your balls
up above your penis?
- Ooh.
- There's, like, a cavity
up in your body,
that sometimes
your testicles can--
they go up there
any time you want.
Like, it's a winter cabin
they can go hang out in
if it gets too cold.
- I'll show you so you can see
the contours on my body.
I'm welcoming him into the house
of Carrera.
The minute you tuck,
the minute you pull that pee-pee
back,
you feel like a woman.
You need to, like,
put your penis away.
- Put my penis away.
- Okay.
- So where does the shaft go?
- That's the one that goes
between your legs.
- And you've been doing this
for how long?
- A while now.
- And you're not all
tuckered out?
- Oh, hell no.
- These are my titties.
- Oh, my God.
- Be gentle with them.
- Oh, my God.
They're so soft.
They feel better
than the real thing.
- Slava is flirty, flirty,
flirty.
- I wanna hear about
your first guy kiss.
- My first guy kiss?
Oh, my gosh.
I was 15, he was 26.
He was straight.
Bam!
- No way.
- Yes.
- I respect that.
- Things that come out
of his mouth,
I'm going, like, "Really, dude,
focus right here.
We're trying to make you
a woman, not a husband."
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, darling.
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, Chris.
So Raja,
now what are you doing
that's gonna make you sisters?
- I'm gonna put my little stamp
as far as styling him,
and making him really feel
a little bit more like Raja.
- Do you have any surprises up
your sleeve, Raja?
- Not just yet.
I've gotta, like,
really dive in,
and we're gonna play with
some makeup
and then the surprise will
probably come at the end,
I hope.
I am looked at by the judges
as being someone
who puts on the funny, cool,
fashion-y costumes,
and does a fierce runway.
How do I make this guy
do the same thing that I do?
Dear God,
please help me.
- Carmen Carrera and Chevy.
It's like a car dealership,
isn't it?
- [laughing]
- How will we know
that the two of you are sisters?
- Well, we're gonna both be
serving body and sex.
- [laughing] Oh.
Well that sounds like
a Carmen Carrera sister.
- Yeah, the one and only
body queen.
- What are you the most
concerned about
in this challenge?
- He uses that sexuality.
- True.
- That's a tough one
right there.
- But it's many years
in the making.
- I don't think it's just
about the look.
I have to kind of transfer
that essence of Carmen Carrera
into this guy.
- Hey, Yara.
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.
You're shaving him.
- Yes.
- Are you shaving Drew all over?
- No, I didn't...
- [laughing]
No, no.
- He doesn't let me.
- What worries you
the most about this?
- I'm not much of a dancer
or anything,
so getting the footwork down
is really my main concern.
- But you play rugby.
Can we see you do
a little twirl?
You're wearing your heels now.
- Try it. Go, go.
[indistinct]
Hey, hey, whoa.
Walk, walk, walk, aah!
- But you know what?
I don't see much challenge
there, Yara.
I expect your sister
to have higher heels.
I want to see Liz Hurley,
fuck-me pumps on the runway.
- Okay.
- She's gonna reflect on you.
- Yes.
- So you have to call the shots.
- Yes, I will.
- Good luck, you guys.
- Thank you.
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hey, Ru.
- You have a sister, don't you?
- Yes.
- Do you get her into drag?
- No, she's a butch lesbian, Ru.
- What's your biggest challenge
in turning Slava into your
sister?
- Making him concentrate
while we have to work.
- It's focus.
Slava plays water polo.
You have to have focus
in sports.
Help him transfer that focus
into doing drag.
- Hey, Manila.
- Hi, Ru.
- What do you have planned out?
- Well, I'm going to be
putting him in, like,
this little kimono.
- Oh, my.
And will so much body
be showing?
- So much body will be showing.
- Wow.
What's your biggest challenge?
- Fuchsia's kind of a brick.
- Uh-huh.
- So I'm gonna have to
break down her face,
and make her as feminine
as possible.
Attractive manly men,
don't make attractive
drag queens.
Fuck. This is gonna be hard.
<i>- Gather around, everybody.</i>
Tomorrow,
on the main stage,
we will be joined
by our guest judges,
actress and comedian
Margaret Cho...
- All: Ooh!
- And the always cheerful,
Sharon Osbourne.
- Yay!
- Ooh!
- Oh, and one more thing.
In addition to the glamorous
looks you've been working on,
you need to style...
cheerleader outfits.
- Oh, okay.
- And then come up with
a fun fight cheer
that supports safe sex.
- [laughing]
Not only walking
on the runway as models,
now we have to cheerleading?
Oh.
- You'll both perform
your cheer tomorrow
on the main stage.
Go team go.
And remember,
don't fuck It up.
- Ready?
- Both: Okay!
- This week's main challenge
is to turn straight jocks
into our drag sisters.
And the twist is,
we have to do a cheerleading
routine about safe sex.
- Wrap your dick,
wrap up your dick.
- Wrap your dick!
- [laughing] Yes!
- Then we're gonna do the
And we're gonna switch.
- What's up, bitches?
- Oh, my God.
Wow.
This is disturbing.
Raja's jock look a mess.
- Yaay!
- I don't know
what the bitch was doing.
But girl,
you don't look that good.
- I don't know about
Raja's sister.
She's supposed to be a heather.
I don't know, she kind of looks
like a Sprepper.
It's basically a Sprite mixed
with Dr. Pepper.
It's not necessarily
a good thing.
It's usually, like,
a booger quality.
Like, oh!
Like, "That's such a Sprepper."
- It's time for me and Slava to
go to the runway and practice.
Look at the judges.
You give them poses.
- Oh, God!
- Keep the balance,
keep the balance.
Alexis Mateo always known
by the "Bam!"
So I'm making him
say it as well,
'cause he better show the judges
that he is part of
the fa-mi-ly.
Bam!
- Bam!
I'm a drama queen, bitch!
- No, you're not a drama queen.
You're a drag queen,
God damn it.
Come on, say it!
- Bam! Bam!
I'm a drag queen.
- I hope that everything
goes well
and he doesn't show more diva
than me tomorrow.
'cause we're gonna
have a problem.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bam!
- Look at the judges.
Seductive.
You want to fuck the judges.
I wanna fuck You guys.
Yes, I'm here.
Eat it, bitch.
You know what I mean?
Grab your waist.
Right.
Left.
<i>Echa pa lante,</i>
look at the judges.
- I'm looking.
- And then left.
No, we're gonna do right again.
Left.
I'm a little worried.
Get him the attitude.
- You better not complicate it.
- No, no, no.
- You're gonna regret this.
- I'm scared to go home.
- Ready, one, two, right foot.
I'll go slower.
Chris in heels,
it's a little funny.
It's not sexy yet.
- I just gotta learn
the count thing.
Are you gonna actually tell me?
- I'm just gonna tell you when.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna be, like,
"Let's go, Chris," all right?
So make sure that you're--
- Or, you mean my stage name.
- Yeah, Enigma.
Sorry, girl.
I know that he has
really good intentions.
But I know that I can only
do so much.
I don't want you to forget this,
'cause it's kind of important.
I'm just hoping that Chris
remembers the few steps
that I taught him
in front of the judges tomorrow.
- Titties up, titties up.
- Titties up.
- When you get here
and you do your twirl,
like, you can look down at your
ass and then look up at them.
- What about my titties,
is that just not cool?
I mean, I love titties.
- No, because I'm not, like,
a titty girl.
I'm like a butt girl.
- [laughing]
- Let's do it again.
- All right.
I only got about two more walks
down here in me.
- All the pain that
you're feeling right now
is the man leaving your body.
You're just becoming more
feminine and more feminine.
- How about my toes
leaving the shoe?
- Yeah.
He's just, like, complaining,
and he's just, like,
"Oh, my God."
And then give us a twirl
to show us body.
No, that's butch.
Be, like, really girly, like...
- When you're walking,
like, look at the judges.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- If you catch one of
their eyes, that's good.
- Can I point?
- Ladies don't point unless
they're picking out shoes.
I want those pairs.
- How's this?
- Well, don't--
what woman do you know
stands like that?
Oh!
Practice on this line,
by putting one foot
over the other
like you're doing a drug test.
Work the runway, fish!
- Fish?
- And strike another pose.
Matt has a really huge
personality.
Okay, you're gonna strike
a feminine pose.
- Oh, okay.
- Not like you're poppin'
a squat in the woods.
- Okay.
- Okay?
It gets annoying.
We'll work on the poses
when we're not on the runway.
I just want you
to get comfortable with--
I just want you to get
comfortable with the runway.
And if you do this
to me tomorrow,
I'm going to seriously
hunt you down...
- All right, all right!
- And kill you.
- I'm just having fun
on the stage, man!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Does your family know
that you're straight?
- [laughing]
Yeah.
My little brother's gay.
- Oh, no way.
- Yeah, yeah.
He's one of those angry
gay people.
- Why?
- He just thinks that
everybody hates him
'cause he's gay or whatever.
Did you ever do drag
in high school?
- No, hell no.
I didn't come out
in high school.
I think people knew
that I was gay.
They didn't have the balls
to come and ask me.
I didn't have a sense of pride
in being gay.
- Uh-huh.
'Cause it was still taboo
to you.
- Yeah, that's why I was, like,
really angry at the world
for a little bit.
You feel wrong
for the most of your life.
And then you don't know why
you feel wrong.
And then you just get mad
at people.
Like, "why do you make me feel
wrong?" You know?
Well, how old is he now?
- 19.
He's 19 now.
- Oh, he's still really young.
- Just a kid.
- He'll get over all of that.
Trust me.
- I hope so.
- He will.
Once he sees his big brother
in drag.
- It's kind of a motivator
For me to do this, you know?
- Yeah.
He's gonna love it.
- Make sure that you don't eat
anything
that's gonna make you bloated
for tomorrow.
- Okay.
- But you're trying to make him
look like you.
So why wouldn't he be bloated?
- Ooh!
- Tell her her mom's bloated.
- You're--
- So we're teaching our sisters
to read.
- It's a natural talent
in a Luzon family, honey.
- You've got the perfect
daughter, Manila.
- Matt is just like Manila.
Completely obnoxious.
- Yo, you guys like
my lobster hat?
- Manila, meet your cell mate,
Matt.
- Do women really slap tables?
- I just slap tables
all day long,
you don't even know,
for real.
- Good morning.
- Challenge day.
We're back into the work room
and it's so much
that has to be done.
- Let's make you into a fish.
- I'm nervous as hell.
- No, no, you can do it.
You can do it.
- All right, all right.
- We are teammates, you know?
- All right.
- We need to practice.
Rush. Come on.
- Both:
Ready? You're gay.
- Keep your peeker--
Pecker.
Fuck.
- Pecker.
- What is a pecker?
- Keep your pecker--
- What is a pecker?
- Pecker is your dick.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- We have the exact same amount
of time that we usually have,
except that this time, we have
to get ourselves in drag
and then a person that has never
been in drag before in drag.
[exhales]
All right. I'm ready for you.
- Whoa.
You're gluing his brows?
- Mm-hmm.
- What's it do?
- It lays them down and then
I can, like, cover them,
and then I can draw them
wherever I want to put
new eyebrows.
The most intimidating part
of this challenge
is that it's not just me.
I now have to, like,
completely do an overhaul
on this masculine straight guy.
- Ancient Chinese secret.
- Ancient drag secret.
- Did you have people who
came out in high school?
In your school,
in Puerto Rico?
- No, I was the only one.
- I had a really hard time
in high school.
I was, like, really close to,
like, being suicidal.
It was, like, left and right.
I couldn't, like,
walk around the school
without being, like,
tormented.
- But you know what,
I went to my ten-year
high school reunion in drag.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How was the reception?
- Awesome.
- Yeah?
- We all had a blast together
for the first time in my life.
Like, I had a great time
with people I went to
high school with.
- [laughing]
- So you're legally married?
- Legally, yeah.
- So if you move--
- It would be invalid.
New Jersey's the only state
that really gives a lot
of the same rights
that they give
a straight married couple.
- So you're stuck
in the armpit of America
because you're gay.
- I think that straight people
take a lot of things
for granted.
You can settle down
with any girl and have kids
and live the American dream,
but it's, like,
so much harder for gay people
to do that.
- Turn around.
It's not that difficult.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
When I first saw myself
transformed,
my heart just stopped.
My breath just gasped,
and I was, like, whoa!
I can't even believe this.
Oh, my God.
- Alexis' jock...
he's a drag queen.
This is your first time?
Mm-hmm.
- We're gonna run out together,
shake your pom pom's like crazy.
Just be, like, aaaah!
And then we stop at the edge
of the stage--
- Oh, we perform on stage?
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait, please.
Please just--please don't.
Really, honestly.
Dude, focus!
Please!
Like, I'm on the line, here.
- Are you angry at me?
- No, I'm just really,
like, freaking out.
- You'll be all right.
Take a deep breath, bro.
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- Well, hello there.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
you're looking sporty.
- Yay, team!
- [laughing]
- Mike Ruiz,
A-list photographer.
Welcome back.
- Oh, thanks for having me back.
- Margaret,
you're Cho beautiful.
- Thank you.
Well, I was raised
by drag queens,
like some are raised by wolves.
So I know drag.
- Well then,
welcome home sweetheart.
Sharon Osbourne,
the coolest mom ever.
Welcome to the show.
- Thank you, my darling.
- How's Ozzy?
- All I can tell you is, Ru,
he absolutely adores you.
- [laughing]
Welcome.
This week,
our queens were challenged
to turn straight jocks into
their glamorous drag sisters.
But first, we asked them to lead
a fun fight cheer
in support of safe sex.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Both: Whoo!
Divas, divas, here we go!
Safe sex is the way to go!
Ooh, you wanna moan?
Ooh, you wanna growl?
Make it safe!
And make us proud!
- I love you.
- And you love me.
- Both:
Safe sex fraternity!
Whoo!
- Safe sex mother fuckers!
- Wrap that dick!
Safe sex, don't get pregnant!
- Both: Ready?
You're gay!
- B-A-R-E!
- B-A-C-K!
- Both: No bareback,
no bareback!
No, no, no bareback!
- I need a C!
- C!
- I need an O!
- O!
- Give me an N!
- N!
- How bout a D?
- D!
- Another O!
- O!
- Another M!
- M!
- What's it spell?
- Both: Safe sex!
Woo-hoo!
- All: [laughing]
- Both: Ready?
Let's go!
- Give your back a cleaning!
- Have that rubber
catch that semen!
- Give me that W!
- W!
- Give me the R!
- R!
- Give me the A!
- A!
- Give me the P!
- P!
- What that spell?
- Both: Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
- Both: Hey, hey, you, you!
You need to get a clue!
Be safe, don't chafe!
Your dick will turn dark blue!
Uh-oh, she said,
my pussy's turning red!
- Ooh!
- Both: They'll burn when they
pee.
Protection is the key!
Safe sex!
- [laughing]
- Well, that was short.
[laughing]
- All: [laughing]
- Both: Ready?
Okay!
Always wear a condom,
and use a dental dam.
Abstinence is for boogers,
but we love our diaphragm!
- [laughing]
- A diaphragm?
- A what?
A diaphragm!
- A who?
- Both: You can use a diaphragm
with spermicidal lube!
Safe sex!
Whoooooo!
- All: [laughing]
- All right, kids.
We are gonna do us some runway.
First up,
Alexis and Avals Mateo.
Sisters in the name of love.
- Those outfits are to die for.
- Some birds did.
-<i> Me and Slava are walking</i>
<i>on that runway</i>
<i>like we are true divas.</i>
<i>He got my style,</i>
<i>he got my walk.</i>
<i>He got my signature move.</i>
-<i> Look at that bum!</i>
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
-<i> Unidentified flying asses.</i>
<i>Raja and her sister Enigma.</i>
-<i> Enigma, please.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>It's the Cheetah Girls.</i>
<i>- It is!</i>
-<i> I know for a fact that</i>
<i>Chris is doing the best job</i>
<i>that he can.</i>
<i>And I hope that</i>
<i>the judges can see that.</i>
-<i> I think Enigma looks</i>
<i>very vulnerable.</i>
<i>Her face is vulnerable</i>
<i>but her</i><span style="bodyStyle"> legs</i><i> look like sailors.</i>
-<i> Up next, we have Yara</i>
<i>and Drewlita Sofia.</i>
<i>Goldfinger.</i>
-<i> This is real Mandrell sisters</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
-<i> We are doing our catwalk,</i>
<i>and I feel so great.</i>
<i>He's doing everything</i>
<i>I taught him.</i>
-<i> Drewlita has that</i>
<i>"don't fuck with me" look</i>
<i>on her face.</i>
-<i> She does.</i>
-<i> I think it's real "Madonna</i>
<i>after yoga" look.</i>
-<i> It's Kabbalah Madonna.</i>
<i>Up next, Carmen and Lolita</i>
<i>Cruz-Carrera.</i>
-<i> Jujubee is back.</i>
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>and he's serving it.</i>
<i>We're giving a lot of body</i>
<i>right now.</i>
<i>We're giving attitude.</i>
<i>We're giving pretty.</i>
<i>We're definitely representing</i>
<i>Carrera.</i>
-<i> This is just like</i>
<i>the Miss New Jersey Pageant.</i>
-<i> Representing Miss Patterson,</i>
<i>New Jersey.</i>
-<i> She sells sea shells</i>
<i>by the Jersey shore.</i>
<i>Last but not least,</i>
<i>the Luzon sisters.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>
-<i> Oh, snap it, Lagerfeld.</i>
-<i> Geisha to go.</i>
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>just as we practiced.</i>
<i>Except that Matt is really</i>
<i>serving it fiercely.</i>
<i>He's truly a Luzon.</i>
-<i> I think it's murder</i>
<i>on the orient runway.</i>
-<i> I think it's more</i>
<i>Kill Bill 2.</i>
-<i> Kill Bill 2 meets To Wong Foo.</i>
-<i> Memoirs of a gay-sha.</i>
-<i> China dolls.</i>
- Welcome, sisters.
Thank you for giving us
something to cheer about.
Now it's time for
the judges' critique.
Let's start with Alexis
and Avals Mateo.
Hi, Avals.
Are you chilly up there?
- Chilly?
- Yeah, your nipples are hard.
- Oh, that's 'cause
I'm a little horny.
- [laughing]
- You really embraced
your feminine side.
You're really getting off on it,
aren't you?
- I really, really am.
- You've probably got a stiffy
going on under there somewhere.
- [laughing]
- I think that Alexis
did a great job on the makeup
and the hair.
- I think the cheer was sloppy
at points.
I think because you tried to put
too much into it.
- You have this
family resemblance
that's in the body,
it's in the face.
You were giving me Kardashian.
I'm keeping up with you.
- Next up, Raja
and her sister Enigma.
- We discovered that we both
have a mutual love
for old movies.
And we thought of maybe
a little bit more
of an old Hollywood glamour.
- What old movie
did you pattern her after?
<i>Tarzan?</i>
- It feels a little jungle.
It felt a little bit more like
<i>La Dolce Vita.</i>
- The walk, however.
It's a bit like a sailor.
- You know, I would
have expect Raja to instill
a little bit more of your
ability in Enigma.
- I thought the cheer
was quite athletic.
I can't remember what you were
cheering about though.
- Um, about bare backing.
- What does that mean?
- It means when you, um,
are fucking without condoms.
- Okay.
Well, that--see I've learned
something new today.
- Which we don't encourage,
we don't encourage.
- No, no, no, no.
Actually, I'm wearing a condom
right now.
- [laughing]
- Next up, we've got Yara Sofia
and her sister, Drewlita.
- Did she resist?
- Yes.
- What did she resist?
- Hair removal, tucking,
dancing, singing.
- So you resisted everything?
- Well, I'm historically
relatively shy.
So I'm just glad that I got out
here to try something new--
- But you have your sister now.
- Exactly.
- So you felt more outgoing once
you were walking the runway?
- Absolutely.
- I thought the cheer was quite
sweet.
You were, like,
fanning your bums.
- [laughing]
- Thank you.
- Well, you guys look amazing.
You look like Heart,
circa 1982,
you know, right when
they were going disco?
- You did such a beautiful job
giving Drewlita that sort of
Madonna face.
Which I think is fierce.
- And they both have man-hands,
just like Madonna.
- Yes.
- [laughing]
- Up next, Manila
and her drag sister Fuchsia.
- She's a true Luzon.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, this personality
is driving us nuts.
- You did an amazing job,
Manila, with the makeup.
Because the before and after
is just really incredible.
And Fuchsia, you seem to have
embraced the whole process.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- [laughing]
- I love this look.
Just giving me that perfect
Hong Kong garden restaurant...
I'm ready to order.
- [laughs]
- Would you date you?
- Yes. Hard.
- [laughing]
Up next, Carmen Carrera
and her sister, Lolita Cruz.
Do you feel pretty?
- Yes, absolutely.
I threw a little swagger into my
step be all right.
- Now Carmen, because
your sister is beefy,
very masculine,
did you ever consider maybe
doing something that sort of
feminized the body
a little bit more?
- You know, I don't care
what kind of body you have.
You know, you can be--
you can do naked.
If I was, you know,
100 pounds overweight,
I would still do my pasties
and get naked.
Because that's how much
confidence I have inside.
And I want to bring that out.
- From the head up,
there is some similarity.
It's just the arms the shoulders
that are still, like--
you know, like...
- [laughs]
You know, He-Man.
- You took care of yourself and
you're like, "Here, sister,
"try this on, girl.
Put this on.
You'll look fierce."
You're known for your body,
I know in your head you think
if you're 100 pounds heavier,
you'd still rock it.
I don't really buy that.
- Now sisters, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls.
Let's start with Alexis
and Avels.
- They had a connection.
And I like that.
- The pro is, they did work
in synchronicity,
but I didn't understand
3/4 of it.
- Slava might have surpassed
Alexis.
- [laughing]
- Raja and Enigma.
- Raja is such a beauty.
And then you had this big,
strutting bloke.
- I didn't really feel
a sisterly connection.
It was more like a
mother-daughter kind of thing.
- I got, like,<i> Mommie Dearest</i>
in Christina.
Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.
- This is one of the bottom two
for me tonight.
- Yara Sofia and her sister
Drewlita.
- Love the outfits.
But I didn't think that there
was such a great connection.
- Drewlita, you know, is an
incredible transformation.
- Yeah, she was really pretty.
- I didn't really get a sibling
thing from them.
- Manila and her sister,
Fuschia.
They had a lot of fun with this.
- Mm.
- And Fuschia was a gas.
- Manila and him
were really good together.
You could tell that they were
enjoying each other.
- The biggest transformation
for me was Fuschia tonight.
Matt is a big ol' jock.
- Carmen and Lolita
Cruz-Carrera.
I don't know if she threw Lolita
under the bus.
Lolita's build was so stocky.
- It was more like
he was trying to help
his less attractive sister,
you know, get laid.
- Was Carmen meant
to dress down?
She has such a magnificent body
on her.
- And that made the awkwardness
of their bodies together
more pronounced.
- There are a million tricks up
Carmen's sleeve, you guys.
- Sure.
- Trust me.
She looked out for herself
all night.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the sisters.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now based on
your jock transformations,
and your presentations
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Alexis Mateo.
- Wait, wait, shh.
- You were a real player
this week.
And I thought
I was seeing double.
Double-D.
You're safe.
- Thank you, guys.
- [exhales]
- Manila.
You served up two China dolls.
And 20 minutes later...
we're still hungry for more.
Condragulations.
You are this week's MVP,
and the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Yeah!
That's my girl!
- You've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas.
Courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
And for helping you
with your win,
we are awarding your jock
the same prize.
- Oh, ho, ho!
Shit! Yeah!
I'm going on a cruise!
- Raja.
You were off your game.
And your sister act was
none the better for it.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru tells me that I have to
lip-synch for my life.
I couldn't believe it.
- Yara Sofia.
You're safe.
Carmen Carrera.
Your look was a home run.
But you left your sister
sitting on the bench.
I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.
- I don't know what to feel
right now.
If I go home,
I'll be upset about it.
I'm just gonna be Carmen
and do what I do best.
I'm just gonna turn it out.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck It up.
-<i> I've worked so hard from day</i>
<i>one since I've been here</i>
<i>and I would hate to go home.</i>
<i>I had to muster up</i>
<i>all the</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fierceness</i>
I could find within me
and just go for it.
[cheers and applause]
- Raja's getting naked.
I'm, like, this is gonna be hot,
'cause Carmen is nudity,
and they're gonna thrown down
right now.
- Ooh!
- This is just soft porn.
It's kinda hot.
- Woo-hoo!
- Wow!
Ladies,
We've had 28 lip-synchs
for your life
and that was by far,
straight up,
the most surprising one eva!
I've made my decision.
Raja.
Shantay, you stay.
- [crying]
I'm glad to be here.
Thank you so much.
It's just an overwhelming
emotion
that comes over you.
And I'm thankful to Ru.
And I'm a very, very lucky
person.
And I just--you know what?
I'm just thankful.
- Carmen Carrera.
Baby, you don't make it easy
to say good-bye.
And you will be missed.
Now...
sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Love you, darling.
- Love you, darling.
- For real this time.
Don't come back, okay?
- [laughing]
- I feel honored that Ru
asked me to come back.
But if my time is up,
my time is up.
- To the final four.
Condragulations.
The race for the crown
has never been so close.
Now remember.
If you can't love yourself...
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- All: Amen!
- All right.
Now, let the music play!

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You will be designing
a couture dress
inspired by these cakes.
Ooh!
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.
- The reality of it
is that she looked awful.
- I would like
to see Shangela go.
She's just a loudmouth,
and she's always halleluing.
- Shangela, get the fuck out.
- Raja.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
Alexis Mateo,
you're a sweet talker,
but your cheesecake couture
struck a sour note
with the judges.
Shante, you stay.
Stacy Layne Matthews,
sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
break out your library cards.
Reading is fundamental.
- Ow!
Eat it, eat it, eat it, ow.
- And a comedy of errors.
- I said,
"Bitch better have my money."
- With extra special
guest judges
comediennes Rita Rudner
and Arden Myrin.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of Kryolan Professional makeup;
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[car engines racing]
- Whoo-hoo.
It's so empty in here.
Hello.
[imitates echo]
Stacy is gone.
"Be a lady.
You're all amazing.
Stacy Layne 'Bryant' Matthews."
- The last challenge,
being in the bottom two,
I think it was a fluke.
So right now
I just have to concentrate
in what the judges
are looking for.
- Well, Stacy's gone.
Now you're the only big girl.
- Stacy probably shouldn't have
been here to begin with.
She didn't meet the criteria.
But now I have a whole other
can of worms to worry about.
For the most part, all the
strong competitors are here.
And it's really hammered in
that now
the competition is super tight.
At this point,
it's getting very personal.
- I wanted to ask you
about yesterday.
When you said you're so tired
of hearing my voice,
my reaction was,
like, I was shocked.
- It came off a lot harsher
than I intended.
- As I'm having this
conversation with Manila,
it's a complete 180
from what she was delivering
on the runway.
I know that Manila
has more faces
than my foot has blisters
after a show.
- And I don't want you to think
that I'm attacking you...
- No.
- But I am attacking you.
Because ultimately
this is a competition,
and I want to beat you.
[alarm wails]
- Ooh, girl.
You've got shemail.
Hello, lady-boys.
- Hi.
- Drag is a serious business,
but sometimes a queen can take
herself a little too seriously.
Remember, laugh, and the world
laughs with you.
Bomb, and the joke's on you,
honey.
- Whoo!
Yeah.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- My legendary children.
A drag superstar needs to
develop a pretty thick skin.
So in the great tradition
of<i> Paris Is Burning,</i>
break out your library cards.
- Oh, god.
- Because reading is what?
Fundamental.
Now, for today's mini challenge,
you'll take turns
reading each other.
Or throwing shade.
Ladies, the library is open,
okay?
- Okay.
- Yara Sofia.
<i>La biblioteca</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is open.</i>
Put on your reading glasses
and read these bitches
for filth.
- Manila Luzon.
It's not because you're Asian.
It's because I need some
patience to deal with you.
Delta Work, is that your tits
or your feet?
- Oh!
- Raja,
you think you're fashion?
You should go to old...school.
- Next up, Manila.
- Ow, eat it, eat it, eat it.
Ow!
- Put on your reading glasses.
- Oh, god.
- Ooh, Yara.
Your blue contacts are so creepy
that it makes my skin itchy,
itchy, itchy...pa'lante.
- Oh!
- It's dinner time, Delta.
And you are serving
body-ody-ody.
Well, I guess
that solves the problem
with all them starving kids
in Africa.
- Thank you, Manila.
Up next is Miss Delta.
- Oh, my gosh.
Yara, isn't it interesting
that when your flight
came into town
the sightings of chupacabras
increased?
[laughter]
Manila, what are we gonna do
when the hurricane
hits all of Asia.
You won't have
any material left.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Raja,
when you're on the runway,
do you keep the 800 number
for suicide?
Because those toes
are ready to jump.
- Whoa!
- Bring your library card,
Miss Alexis Mateo.
- Get ready, bitches.
Miss Shangela, girl,
can we have some water?
Her hair is thirsty, baby.
- Uh-oh.
- Delta, just grow a neck,
honey.
- Whoa!
- All they can read is my size,
and that's so obvious.
Now tell me something funny.
- Raja, should I call you Raja
or grandma?
- Ooh!
- Oh!
- Raja, you are up.
- Shangela,
I hope you still have
your phone card to Middle-earth,
'cause the hobbits are calling.
- Ooh!
- Fat.
Who cares?
Syphilis.
[laughter]
- Carmen, the library
is open to you, my dear.
- Word.
- Yara, what the fuck are you
saying, girl?
- Alexis, girl, I been thinking
about you all day.
I was at the zoo.
- Ooh!
- All right, last but not least,
Shangela.
Yes.
- Oh.
Mimi Imfurst.
[laughter]
Raja, I know you call yourself
Top Model,
but I think Tyra Banks and I
would agree
you're just fashion roadkill.
- Ooh!
- Manila Luzon,
Asian role model.
Well, I hope you're referring to
the rolls all over your body.
- Ooh!
- And, aw, Carmen Carrera.
Honey, just go
jump in the ocean.
You won't drown.
Silicone floats.
- All right, girl.
The library
is permanently closed.
All right, ladies, good job.
But I think we have a winner.
Shangela!
For this week's main challenge,
you need to develop
a stand-up comedy routine.
To help you create
a winning routine,
you'll each take
a one-on-one comedy workshop
with legendary funny lady
Miss Rita Rudner.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my god, Rita!
I can't wait to meet
Rita Rudner!
- Now, for your
stand-up performance,
you'll need to put together
a funny outfit
worthy of a queen of comedy.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the funniest bitch win.
- All right.
See y'all later.
- Oh, my.
Yes, I am a little terrified.
My heart stopped, actually,
when she said that.
It's frightening,
'cause I'm just hoping
that I don't bomb,
and that happens a lot
with comedians.
If you don't have
the perfect timing,
you could really fuck it up.
Shangela's an amazing comedian.
She's been doing it for a while,
so I'm sure she's gonna do
really well in this one.
- Well, damn sure I was right
when I said,
"I want that bitch to go."
- Well, no, because comedy
is hit or miss.
It's a lot of pressure.
- We all kind of
have to be good,
the three of us, because their
group's still the same size.
Our group is getting smaller.
- It's like our workroom
is now divided into two groups.
We got team talent
and team look.
Raja, Delta, Carmen, and Manila
all put the emphasis
on their look.
They can't perform.
- Today we have to do
a stand-up routine,
and we have to create
a drag look
that goes with
our stand-up routine.
- I'm gonna have to do some
brainstorming here.
- Well, that's gonna be hard.
You see what time she's having
with it.
The workroom today
is very quiet.
There's no sewing.
Everyone is digging
deep inside their brains,
trying to find
what about themselves is funny.
- I'm--I'm afraid.
- You can't be afraid.
You got to go in or go home.
- It's hard
to make people laugh,
but I'm gonna do it.
I'm so funny.
Funny enough
that you gonna laugh.
- A lot of people here
host a show,
so everyone here is gonna be
strong competition,
and that's, like,
when they tell me that
my makeup's not the best,
you know, it's important to me
to look--
have the look right.
When I get
in front of the judges,
it's never a question
about talent.
It's always something
regarding my makeup.
- The purpose for the makeup
is not to look...painted.
- What about when I'm doing here
and sculpting the face?
You know how you talk about
a round face?
- From here up, I don't use
a lot of foundation.
I don't need it there.
- Oh, it's not even
all the way across?
- No.
- No.
Because then you're
creating a mask.
Everything that Shangela said
is exactly
what you never should do.
- You don't put on powder
between steps?
- No! No!
[laughter]
How do you--no, no.
- Hello, funny ladies.
- Hi.
- Funny girls.
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Now, you're obviously
from New Jersey.
You have sort of
a Jersey accent.
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.
Are you gonna play up sort of
the stereotypical things
that people may think of you?
- No, I'm not typical Jersey.
So...
- How do you know you're not
typical Jersey?
- I don't think I am.
I don't see it.
Am I that Jersey?
Like, what does that mean?
I mean, is that an insult?
- A lot of comedy
comes from stereotypes,
and if you play on that,
it can be very funny.
People can relate to it.
Because, really, you want to
invite people into your world
and make them feel comfortable.
But it's up to you whether
you're willing to let us in.
- I don't really like
to let anyone in.
- Well, you got to
get over that.
Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- You know, this seems like
a shoo-in for you.
You're very funny.
- I'm going back
to my childhood.
As an adult looking back,
how gay some of the things
I used to watch on TV were.
<i>Sesame Street?</i>
- Right, right.
So now, in the past,
I've heard jokes
about<i> Sesame Street.</i>
- Um, maybe.
I don't really know.
- I want to hear something
that we haven't heard before.
Get back to work.
- Thanks.
- See ya.
Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- Have you done comedy before?
- No, we have never
do stand-up comedy.
- I see.
And you're gonna tell
some jokes?
- Yes.
- As Alexis, or as a character?
- As Alexis Mateo.
And it's gonna talk about
my coming to America experience.
It was a big change.
It was the problem
with the language.
- No one else
has your life experience,
so if you draw on that,
how could you go wrong?
Especially if you can
laugh at yourself.
- I love making fun of myself.
- I am so excited.
I can't wait to laugh,
laugh, laugh.
- Thank you for stopping
by my office.
- All right.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye.
Hey, Delta.
- Hi, Ru.
- I have a feeling
you're gonna be very funny.
- Um, I am.
- They say that comedy comes
from, you know, a dark place,
and I have a feeling that
you've spent a lot of time
where, uh,
maybe people have said
some nasty things to you,
and you've had a lot of time
to think about getting back
at them.
Am I right?
- Yes, that's very true.
But I don't want it to seem
like,
"Poor me, poor me, poor me."
I want it to be like, "Poor me,
pour me another one."
I'm so excited.
I think if I'm clear
and concise about the jokes,
I think that I could win.
- I can't wait.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
All right, ladykins.
Gather around.
In a moment you'll meet
with guest judge Rita Rudner,
who will help you with your
chutzpah, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Now, Shangela, since you
won the mini challenge,
you get an extra ten minutes
with Rita Rudner.
Plus you get to choose
the order of the lineup.
- This is where the real shade
is gonna happen.
- Now, tomorrow,
on the main stage,
we'll be joined by guest judge,
the sassy comedian from
<i>Chelsea Lately</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Mad TV,</i>
Arden Myrin.
- Whoo!
- Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be performing
your stand-up
in front of the harshest critics
of all--
a live audience.
So don't fuck it up.
I'll see you later.
- All right, bye.
- I work in front of
an audience at my shows.
It's the best place
to get energy.
The problem is sometimes
that energy is good,
and sometimes it's bad.
- You guys want to come over,
'cause I got the order of
the show set up for tomorrow.
- Okay.
- I know how it is to work
at a club.
When you go to work
at a drag show,
they usually put the girls
who they don't like
in the beginning.
- Opening the show's
gonna be Raja.
She's, what we call
in the comedy world,
biting the bullet.
And then Carmen, Alexis.
I put Carmen second.
If she's great, she follows Raja
and makes Raja look horrible.
Alexis, you'll introduce me,
and then I'll introduce Manila.
Then Yara and Delta,
you'll close the show, okay?
I put Manila directly after me.
If she's intimidated by me,
let her be
really intimidated by me.
- Why did you put me in the...
before the last one?
- I know you probably
wanted to be
toward the end of the show,
but I don't want you
to be the last one.
Yara wants to go last,
but I put her next to last.
If she knocks it
out of the park,
that puts Delta
at a disadvantage,
because then she has to
close the show
and go after Yara.
- If the intention
is to fuck with people,
it's not gonna work.
This is my make it moment,
because this is what I do
for a living, and...
- Yeah.
- Is entertain people
on the microphone.
- What do you think
about the order?
- I think it's a setup.
- For you, like, if I were to go
right after Shangela,
I'd be a little bit nervous.
- If I go out there and bomb,
it's gonna be like,
"Oh, fuck."
- They should have never told me
they saw me as a threat.
I will see each one of them
go home.
- Hi, Manila.
I'm Rita.
- Hi, Rita.
I'm a huge fan.
Rita Rudner is going to be
giving us stand-up advice.
She's one of the funniest people
in show business.
- And what are you going to do
for us today?
- Looking back at
some of the PBS programming
that I used to watch
and how gay
it actually seems now.
- Let's hear you
do the first joke.
- So looking back at Mr. Rogers,
I don't know
if he was on the down-low,
because he had a second house.
And every show started out
with a costume change.
Comedy's hard.
I'm just nervous that, like,
other people's routines
are gonna be,
like, so much funnier than mine.
- My life is funny.
- And now tell us
some of the funny things.
- I am from Puerto Rico.
Since I was just a little girl.
You know.
- That's funny.
- [clicks tongue]
I went all the way to Florida.
- Maybe let's make a joke
about that.
You say, "I came to Miami.
"I was in first class.
I was in the front of the raft."
- I was in the--in the what?
- In the front of the raft.
- In the raft?
- Yes, that's a raft.
- Girl, I don't know
if I can pronounce that.
- My, um, act is gonna be based
on the film<i> Carrie.</i>
- I haven't seen<i> Carrie</i>
in 40 years.
I always worry about
a specific movie reference.
If no one has seen, uh,
the movie, she is in trouble.
- And my outfit that
I'm wearing, actually,
it's sort of this
blood-drenched,
like, you know, gown.
- You come in--"Did anyone else
just get their period?"
- See, I wanted to do
a period joke.
Anybody else get their period?
- "Did anyone else<i> just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get."</i>
-<i> "Just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get their per..."</i>
So did anyone else
just get their period?
- But stay still
while you're doing it.
- Anyone else
just get their period?
- There you go.
I laughed.
- So I think what I do is
I want to kind of start out
by maybe
I should drop some weight.
- Good.
- And basically, like, that's
kind of what it's about.
A fat chick's like a unicycle.
Every guy wants to be with one.
They want to take one on a ride.
They just don't want to be seen
doing it.
Ultimately, I think what I want
to do is maybe not, like, love,
and maybe not just, like,
a one-night stand.
I think what it is is I just
want to sit on a guy's face.
- You're not really talking
about how to lose weight.
- Right.
- You know, you have to decide
what it is that you're going to
talk about.
- I'm a post-modern pimp ho.
I've never performed
as a character
on the stage other than myself.
- You've got it right away.
When you come out and say, "Yo,
you know, bitch..."
you've got that--
you've got the character
perfectly right there.
- Great.
But I'm feeling more pressure,
and definitely a little nervous.
You always want to shine,
especially when people think
it's what you do.
- Hi.
- Hello, Yara.
- Hi.
I'm supposed to be
a little person.
- Right.
- Yes, I want to make a story.
This girl from Spain.
It's hard to live here
in States,
and I miss the guy.
This gorgeous guy.
And I follow him.
You know, I'm a little person,
and I have to poop.
[imitates flatulence]
Get out, get out,<i> cabron.</i>
Get out, get out, get out,
<i>cabron.</i>
Get out, get out, get out.
- That is the most unusual act
I've ever seen.
- Oh.
It's so weird hearing my voice.
- Now, Carmen, are you doing,
um, something personal about you
or other people?
- Haven't really pieced together
what I'm gonna do yet.
- Just say some things you have
on that lovely sheet of paper.
- Um...
- Come on.
You have to say something
in the mic,
otherwise we can't help.
- Okay, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.
- You silly boy.
Come over here.
- Like, I just have, like,
a bunch of topics that I...
- Okay, what are some more
of your topics?
- Okay, I'm the only queen
that's really here
from new Jersey,
and I don't look at myself
in the mirror
and see a stereotypical
new Jersey person.
- So did you always
feel out of place?
- Never.
- But you should,
because that's gonna be funny.
There's nothing funny about
a good-looking person
doing well,
who's confident.
So think of something that
you're insecure about,
and share it with us.
- Let's see...mm...
- I didn't understand where
her humor was going to
come from,
so I'm gonna worry about Carmen
tonight.
- [alarm beeps]
-<i> Buenos dias.</i>
- Let the funny come out.
- We're back
in the workroom today,
and the challenge this week
is to come up with a hilarious
outfit for the runway
and then perform
a stand-up routine
for a live audience.
- She sounds like--like a goat.
- Girl, I got to learn
this thing by memory.
It's so loud in here, it's still
hard to commit stuff to memory
when everyone's talking,
you know.
- [moans]
- [sighs]
- Delta's a little bit shaken
at this point,
because this is a
really high-pressure challenge.
She's struggling, and I really,
really feel for her.
- I'm terrified,
and I'm scared as shit.
I'm so worried, you know?
- Relax.
Don't stress.
We got this.
We're the Heathers.
- Yep.
- We're the Heathers.
- We're the Heathers.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, babe.
Your face looks so much better.
- 'Cause I'm gonna be a clown,
'cause I'm gonna be hilarious!
- Before, you was painted like
a motherfuckin' ghost, honey.
- Why are you making fun of me
so hard?
I just want to be a fierce
drag queen like the next girl.
- Hey, Manila,
are you going to speak
in, like, your Asian accent?
- Are you gonna speak
with an Espanol accent?
- I can't help it.
[laughter]
- You know what you should do?
You should do
that British accent
you were so successful at.
- Fuck you.
- So funny to me.
- Isn't it funny?
- It is funny.
- Manila told Ru that
she's so tired of my mouth.
But you'll never
see her shut up.
I don't even think
she takes air.
- Okay?
This show is gonna start out
with a bang.
- I see Carmen in her fat suit.
It's just--it's so too much.
It's so weird.
I was like, "Really, girl?
This is what you're gonna do?"
- Bitch, and I want to
lay on it, honey.
- I know that everyone is,
like, "Oh, well, Carmen.
I'm worried about Carmen."
My mentality is,
this is going to work.
- She just signed the paper.
She's on her way home.
[laughter]
[upbeat music]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle,
how is your funny bone?
- Oh, being tickled
as we speak.
- Hey, Billy B.
Are you related to Celine Dion?
- No.
- Then why the long face?
[laughter]
Rita Rudner.
Thank you for giving my girls
a master class in comedy.
- I was very impressed,
and I think
it's going to be a lot of fun.
I can't wait.
- Arden Myrin.
- Hi.
- I hope you're wearing
your iPad,
because the fun
is about to flow, girl.
- I never go anywhere
without it.
- [laughter]
For this week's main challenge,
we asked our girls
to make us laugh out loud
with their own
stand-up routines.
Tonight,
headlining on the main stage,
let's welcome RuPaul's
drag queens of comedy.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
- Hello.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody else on their period?
You know, I'm a little bit into
the horror movies.
Can you guess which one?
<i>Carrie,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> yes.</i>
How many people have seen
<i>Carrie,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> actually?</i>
Well, see, good, good.
The real special thing
about Carrie
is that she has
telekinetic powers.
Telekinesis means that you can
move things with your mind.
The last time I moved anything
with my head,
it was in a motel room.
The john threw $40
on my come-slick tits
and told me
to get the fuck out.
I was like,
"I'm leaving, fucker,
I'm leaving."
Good god.
You ain't got to yell at me
like that.
I'll see you at home, dad.
[laughter]
- I'm a drag queen.
When you first start doing drag,
it's, like, you want to be
the fishiest.
You want to have the best body.
But now I want to be a fat girl.
I want to be a fat girl.
You can get dick
from anywhere.
Every guy wants to secretly
fuck a fat bitch, number one.
So I'm not gonna have
no man problems, okay?
I want to be, like, really fat.
I want to get pregnant
and not even know it.
[laughter]
You know, have you seen those
specials on TV?
And it's usually a big girl.
It's, like,
of course she didn't know
she was fuckin' pregnant.
You know what I mean?
I want to go to the bathroom,
sit on the toilet, and become a
mother, okay?
No matter what size I am,
I will be the body beautiful.
Always, okay?
You want to see?
A little preview?
[cheers and applause]
And I will still [bleep]
turn it, darling.
Always.
- Whoo!
Yes, bitches!
It is not Angelina Jolie.
It is not Beyoncé.
It is your girl, Alexis,
all the way from Puerto Rico!
[speaking Spanish]
Yes, ma'am, honey!
And I am so excited,
because I always wanted to be
a star, honey,
so I left Puerto Rico behind,
and I moved to united states,
all the way to Florida.
I did travel in first class.
Right in front of that boat,
baby.
Honey, I'm a Latina girl,
and I only have two options
in this country--
being a housekeeper
or being a stripper, bitches.
And you all know I didn't came
here to clean toilets, baby,
so I became a stripper, baby!
Yes, ma'am, honey.
If god give it to you, baby,
you better make some money.
Yes, ma'am.
I am here and I'm queer, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
I said, "Bitch
better have my money."
Right?
Let me tell you something, baby.
They call me Laquifa.
Laquifa the P.M.P.
Now, that stands for
the post-modern pimp ho.
Post-modern pimp ho means, yes,
I'm still a pimp,
but I'm also my own ho.
That's right.
'Cause of the recession, y'all,
I'm telling you,
I done had to scale back.
You know, and sometimes I don't
even pay myself my own money.
Uh-huh.
If I did, maybe
I could get some shoes
where my toes wasn't hanging
five inches off the edge.
Yeah.
I know you tried to clown me
for my cliffhangers.
Yeah, I saw it.
You know, they always try
to clown me on the block, baby.
They always saying, "Laquifa!"
I say, "What?"
They say, "Laquifa,
where your hoes at?"
I said, "Bitch, don't you see
"I'm wearing four pair of hose
right here,
holding back my dick?"
Ugh!
Boy, you know,
I had a dumbass girlfriend
that went and joined PETA?
She came screaming at me
last week
talking about, "Laquifa!"
I said, "What?"
She said, "Laquifa,
don't you know
how many innocent animals
had to die
for you to have that fur coat?"
I said, "Bitch,
do you know how many
rich animals I had to fuck
to get this coat?"
Stupid bitch.
- Hi, everyone.
My parents weren't really big
about the TV.
I really only had, like,
PBS and<i> Sesame Street.</i>
Sesame Street
was one gay-ass block.
Okay, obviously we have
Bert and Ernie.
I mean, they're so gay,
they practically
are board members of GLAAD.
Um, now,
one of my favorite people
that lives on Sesame Street
is the Count.
He's one of those old,
Liberace gays,
and he loves
collecting tchotchkes,
like Faberge eggs.
[imitating Count]
One Faberge egg,
two Faberge egg,
three Faberge egg.
Ah, ah, ah.
- Whoo!
- Hi, I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm gonna make
a long story short.
I met a guy in a club,
and he took me
to wonder restaurant
he call McDonald's.
"You want chicken sandwich?"
I go, "What the hell
is chicken?"
She told me,
"Chicken means pollo."
Pollo means
"cock" in Spain!
So I don't want to eat
a fucking dick sandwich.
After that, he took me
to the apartment,
and he took her clothes off.
"Oh, my god,
what the hell is that?"
He was huge.
The difference between an onion
and a 14-inch dick,
both makes me cry.
[laughter]
[imitates flatulence]
Get out, get out, get out,
get out, get out!
Get out, get out,<i> cabron.</i>
There was shit
all over the bed.
I felt like a Willy Wonka
Chocolate Factory.
[cheers and applause]
- My name's Delta Work.
I'm in my early to early 30s,
and, um, I'm here in southern
California
just kind of looking for love,
you know,
and it's kind of hard
for a big girl like me,
because it's so
body-conscious in L.A.,
and it freaks me out to think--
who is gonna want
a girl like me?
What?
Is that funny?
Like, I see these stories
about these girls
that they go out running
and then they get,
like, abducted and assaulted,
and, you know, it's, like,
I have to eat frozen burritos.
I have to watch the marathon
of<i> Hoarders.</i>
Because if I go out
and exercise,
I'm gonna get raped.
You guys have been
an amazing audience.
Thank you so much
for coming out.
We appreciate you coming out.
- Welcome back, ladies.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raja.
How'd you feel out there?
- [exhales noisily]
I'm so glad that's over.
It was really challenging.
- What I loved
about your performance
was that you had a topper
of your topper line
when you said the dad.
- Yeah.
- When did you think of that?
- Today.
- Today.
It was good.
The makeup is flawless.
I could go on and on, but wow.
Your face is by far the most
beautiful you've ever looked.
- I notice you had a lot of
setup;
not a lot of punch lines.
- Overall, I thought
you did a great job,
and it's not easy to go first,
and you look...
- Next up, Carmen Carrera.
- Hey, guys.
- You didn't share your act
with Rita yesterday.
Was that a strategy you had?
- No, not at all.
My way of thinking
is very weird.
Some people, I guess,
think that I might be,
like, not paying attention
and not focusing,
but I'm always in my head.
- How is your head?
- My head is good.
- Haven't had any complaints
yet.
[laughter]
- Rita, what'd you think?
- Well, I was so proud of you.
I couldn't figure out where
the jokes were gonna come from,
and you figured it out.
- I thought that you were pretty
and you relied on that,
so that performance completely
changed my opinion of you.
- I love the hair and the
outfit.
It's like Wonder Woman meets my
favorite shag rug.
If you can be beautiful and
funny, there's your super power.
- I thought you were gonna suck.
Honest to god.
I am so proud of you tonight.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Carmen, are you actually
wearing anything
underneath that jacket?
- I kind of wanted to
show you guys my real body.
- [laughs]
If I looked like that,
I would never
take that outfit off
or put clothes on.
- Thank you, Carmen.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I loved your reveal,
and they are big.
There's "a", "b", "c",
and Volkswagens.
I think maybe you relied
a little bit too much
on the visual gag.
- In radio,
you call it a crutch.
It's when you repeat something
over and over
'cause you don't know
what to say.
In Alexis' case it was "honey."
"Listen, honey.
"Let me tell you something,
honey.
No, honey.
Honey, honey, honey."
but be aware of those crutches.
- All right, Alexis.
Thank you.
Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
The pimptress.
- All right.
- I loved your concept.
It was so strong.
You kept on that theme.
And there was absolutely
no dead air.
- I just felt like people
were really with you,
and we felt like we
were in the hands of a pro.
- You look better tonight
than I've ever seen you look.
- You blended,
and I see the major difference.
- Thank you.
- So kudos to you, Shangela.
- I think that
that act and your talent
is money in the bank.
- Next up, Manila.
Now, the<i> Sesame Street</i><span style="bodyStyle"> jokes</i>
were very funny.
Did you think of those, or had
you heard them somewhere else?
- No, I just kind of, like,
quick made it up.
I mean, maybe someone else
suspects it too?
- I think the audience
took a beat to get to know you.
And especially
following Laquifa.
You know, you had to really
readjust the whole energy
of the audience.
- The content that you had
for the jokes
and what they were based on,
some of them were lost
because when we were
sort of laughing,
you were onto the other one.
- Were you nervous?
- I kind of was.
- You did feel the most
rehearsed of everybody.
Like, maybe in a stiffer way.
- Everything about you visually
is right on point tonight,
Manila.
But I feel like I've heard
a lot of those jokes before.
I mean, the Bert and Ernie joke,
let's be honest.
Everybody has been telling that.
- Up next, Yara Sofia.
- Yes!
Yes!
- What was
your character's name?
- Blara.
I have a friend
that is a little person,
and he pushed me to do it.
- And he would not be offended
by this at all?
- No.
I did it with the respect.
This is the stand-up comedy
that comedians do
in Puerto Rico.
- I was wondering if
it was going to be too graphic,
but I knew your energy
would take care of it,
and we loved watching you.
- I don't know
what you talked about,
except chicken and some shit.
- I have to say,
I love the character,
and your capacity
to stay on your knees
could earn you a lot of money
somewhere.
- Up next, we've got Delta Work.
You seemed a little bit nervous.
- I loved the beginning,
but at the end,
we kind of went a bit of
a distance without a laugh.
- I did notice going off-track
of what I thought
I was gonna do,
and I guess in some--
somewhere in my mind,
I thought
that was being organic.
- It started off sort of strong.
It felt very defined.
And then, I feel like
maybe you lost your way.
And then I felt like
there wasn't a payoff.
- Just remember, when
you're portraying a character,
you got to go
all the way with it.
So pump it up.
Get out of your head.
- Okay.
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
Now, while you all
enjoy an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starts]
- Just between us girls,
let's start with Raja.
- First of all, I love the
bucket of blood on her head.
She didn't really go inward
for her comedy.
- We didn't get to know
anything more about Raja.
- Had she incorporated
or paralleled
her own story
with Carrie's story,
it would have been funny.
Let's talk about Carmen Carrera.
- She was the one
I was worried about.
She didn't tell me one joke.
And she thought about it
and came back with it.
I was so impressed.
- Tonight she did
a great performance.
I was very happy to see
that personality come out.
- Honey, Alexis Mateo.
I was a little disappointed
that she rushed through it.
She didn't let her routine
breathe.
- It just seemed
super amateur to me.
- I liked her physicality.
She had some fun dance moves,
but I don't remember her act.
- Shangela.
She was very confident
and comfortable on the stage.
- What she had was a character
I've never seen before,
and she has a catchphrase
that I want to hear
over and over.
- To me, as a stand-up,
the audience wants to know
that they're in good hands.
With Laquifa, we wanted to go
along on the ride.
- Her makeup was a lot better
tonight too.
- It really was.
- I think she did a good job.
- Manila Luzon.
A lot of people
recognized her routine.
Or it just felt very familiar.
- I do think
she added some things
that I'd never heard of,
like Mr. Rogers and the mailman.
I've never heard that.
But it didn't seem fresh.
- Yara Sofia.
That bitch was crazy.
She reminded me of Andy Kaufman,
who did things that sort of
just freaked people out,
but they still laughed.
- I always say, when you do
something, do it 110%.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I think she did it 120%.
- I felt like it could be at,
like, the Whitney Museum as,
like, a performance.
- The Whitney and Bobby Museum.
- [laughs]
- Delta Work.
- It started out good,
and then it just went
all over the place.
- It was kind of dark,
wasn't it?
- And it was a bit sad.
- She's thinking way too much
about everything that she says.
She's got a constant sadness
around her.
- All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Send in the clowns.
- Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your ability
to tickle our funny bones,
I've made some decisions.
Alexis Mateo,
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raja...
bloody well done.
You are safe.
- Thank you.
- Manila, your presentation
was stiff.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru says I'm in the bottom
two, I'm in shock.
At this point in the game,
like, where we're all so good,
like, any little fuck-up
is now magnified.
- Shangela,
as a post-modern pimp,
you bitch-slapped
the competition.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
You've won an original
custom-designed gown
from Miami Elite Designs.
- Hallelu.
[laughter]
I'm almost speechless,
and the judges' response to me
makes me just feel like
I'm going
in the right direction.
Thank you.
- Yara Sofia, you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
- Aah!
[laughter]
- Carmen Carrera, you're safe.
Delta Work, my dear.
This week, you lost your way.
I'm sorry, but you are
up for elimination.
- Okay.
I'm pissed off because this
should be my first time
in the bottom.
This shouldn't be my third time
in the bottom.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself
from elimination.
- Oh, my god.
I don't want Delta to go.
- The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
[intro to<i> Macarthur Park</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
- [laughs]
- I'm looking at Manila,
and I'm going, "Wow.
This is Broadway."
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
[applause]
- That is what a lip-synch
for your life
is all about.
Now, I have made my decision.
Manila, shante, you stay.
- Thank you for everything
you've given me.
I love you.
[crying]
- Fuck.
- Delta, you are a great queen,
and this experience
will propel you
into a phase where you can trust
your god-given instinct.
You know what?
I love you.
I adore you.
- Thank you.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you very much.
[applause]
- I'm gonna miss you.
- [crying]
- I took some risks.
Um, it didn't work in this case,
but I'm not disappointed
in myself.
I'm so happy
to have made it this far,
and I'm just glad
to have lost to a Heather,
not to one of the boogers.
- Condragulations, girls.
You are all one step closer to
becoming America's next
drag superstar.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.
[upbeat music plays]
Grand prize contributed in part
by AlandChuck.travel.


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
May the funniest bitch win.
- It's like our workroom is now
divided into two groups.
We got team talent
and team look.
I will see each one of them
go home.
- Whoo!
- Anybody else on their period?
- Mm-hmm, I said bitch better
have my money!
- Pfffft!
Get out, get out, get out,
get out!
- That bitch was crazy.
Shangela, you bitch-slapped
the competition.
Con-drag-ulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
[cheers and applause]
That is what a lip sync for your
life is all about.
Manila...
shante, you stay.
Delta...
sashay away.
-<i> I'm just glad to have lost</i>
<i>to a Heather,</i>
not to one of the boogers.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
I'm so excited,
I'm lactating.
<i>Fierce flies.</i>
- [imitates gunfire]
-<i> And a star-spangled salute...</i>
- Bam!
-<i> With extra special guest</i>
<i>judges</i>
<i>Cheryl Tiegs</i>
<i>and Johnny Weir.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Yoo-hoo!
Toughest queens coming through.
-<i> So we're back in the workroom,</i>
<i>and there's Delta's message,</i>
and it's pretty
heartbreaking for me, because
Delta and I are so close.
- I can't believe I sent
Heather home.
Delta's gone.
We're missing one Heather.
<i>It's sad, but I haven't had</i>
<i>such a rush in my life before.</i>
<i>When I was lip-syncing</i>
<i>last week,</i>
<i>I was living onstage.</i>
<i>It's really put in a new energy</i>
<i>into how I'm playing this</i>
<i>competition.</i>
- Delta was so fetch.
- She was fetch.
- Heather, stop trying to make
"fetch" work.
It's not happening.
- What is the hell with this
"Heathers" group?
<i>I think Carmen is fake.</i>
<i>I think Raja is fake.</i>
<i>I think Manila is fake.</i>
Bam.
- Oh, I love you, Delta.
- You sent her home.
- Well, bitch, it was her or me,
honey.
- See you at the bathhouse,
girl.
- What'd you think about how,
you know, everyone was so sad
when Delta left and went up and
gave that big old hug
and that teary good-bye
and that production?
- It was exactly that,
a production.
It was a "we are the world,
we are the children" moment
on the stage.
- Let's stay strong in this
competition, okay?
- All right.
[siren wails]
- Oh!
- Ooh, girl!
<i>You got she mail.</i>
Hey, racers.
all: Hello.
- I have dragged my ass all
around this world,
and I've learned one thing--
the U.S.A. is still the best
damn country on earth.
- Yes.
- Whoo!
- My fellow drag Americans,
ask not what<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
can do for you.
Ask what you can do for
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[laughs]
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Whoa!
- Well, howdy, partners.
This week, we're gonna focus on
two of my favorite things--
"t" and "a."
You want to know what the "t"
is?
all: Yes!
- All right.
<i>For today's mini challenge,</i>
<i>I want you to turn these plain</i>
<i>brassieres</i>
<i>into something</i>
<i>truly glamorific.</i>
I want you to bedazzle a healthy
pair of hooters.
- Ooh! Yes!
- Yes!
- The queen with the most
bedazzling bra wins.
Now, you have 30 minutes,
so ready, set...
Go!
[frantic percussion]
- Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
Yes!
- Oh, fuck that asshole!
[humming]
- Really? Is that, like,
actually part of the challenge?
Deal with you?
-<i> Aah!</i>
<i>Oh, girl, look.</i>
<i>The bra--that's the wrong side.</i>
- No, you didn't.
- My initial idea is to do kind
of a modern replica
<i>of RuPaul's face on the bra.</i>
Now, that is couture.
- All right, ladies,
time's up.
<i>Gather round.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
I'm so excited, I'm lactating.
First up, Alexis Mateo.
Careful, girl.
You could put somebody's eyes
out with those things.
<i>Bam!</i>
- [laughs]
- Beautiful.
Thank you, Alexis.
- Thank you.
-<i> Next up, Yara Sofia.</i>
Wow.
- This is my ze-bra collection.
-<i> Ah, your ze-bra.</i>
- By Yara Sofia's Secret.
- Hunty.
Next up, Shangela.
- [humming sultry music]
- Ooh.
Now, is that corn?
- Actually, this is supposed to
be a model of you.
- Uh-huh.
- With the big blond hair here,
and then it's the signature
RuPaul line.
I'm hoping to pitch it to you.
-<i> I didn't see RuPaul's head</i>
<i>in there at all.</i>
I just saw, like,
popcorn kernels.
-<i> And you're using the glitter,</i>
which is really interesting.
Next up, Raja.
- I kind of wanted to go for,
like, rocker chick Samantha Fox
meets<i> Burlesque,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> so I tried to</i>
concentrate a few of the...
- Well, I think that they're
perfect for motor-boating.
Bbbbbbb!
- Pfffft!
- Thank you, Raja.
Carmen Carrera.
Ooh, there's rhinestones in them
there hills.
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you breast-feed
with those?
- I don't breast-feed.
I pump.
- Oh, you pump.
Very Latoya.
For those of you who didn't
believe, roll up your sleeves.
Next up, Manila.
Now, is that a nursing bra?
- Well, I thought they looked
like rivets,
so I went for, like, a submarine
look for my torpedoes.
[imitates torpedoes firing]
[imitating gunfire]
-<i> Better luck next time, Manila.</i>
To kill RuPaul, you gotta be
faster than that.
- Uhh!
- Ladies, all of your designs
were truly bodacious.
<i>But I can only choose one.</i>
So cross my heart,
the winner is...
[suspenseful music]
Manila.
- Whoo!
<i>Yes!</i>
- Why, those are the fastest
tits in the west.
- [exhales sharply]
- Now, I told you this week was
all about my two favorite
things--"t" and "a."
The "t" was for ta-tas,
but the "a" is for...
America.
- Ohh!
-<i> Yes.</i>
There is no place like
the U.S. of A.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll each create a public
service announcement
entitled
"Why I love the U.S.A."
So the message should be
entertaining and from the heart,
because we'll be sending your
P.S.A.s
<i>to the brave men and women</i>
<i>who are serving our</i>
<i>country overseas.</i>
You'll each have ten minutes
in front of the camera,
and, Manila, since you won
the mini challenge,
you'll get an extra
five minutes.
<i>Gentlemen...</i>
start your engines.
And may the best American woman
win.
- It just kind of needs to be a
few words, right?
- Yeah, I'm doing, like,
snippets.
-<i> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking</i>
<i>of.</i>
<i>When it came time for me</i>
<i>to write my P.S.A.,</i>
I had to think about what
American values
do I cherish the most?
If it's too speech-y...
it's only supposed to be 30
to 60 seconds long,
<i>so you have to kind of fill it</i>
<i>in</i>
with just a few words, you know.
I always want it to feel
inspired,
and I definitely want to be
connected to it emotionally.
- Uh!
-<i> Ew!</i>
- Did you really seriously fart?
- [laughing]
- Sick.
- I'm having a hard time
with it.
- You are?
- Yes, I have so many things
that are personal.
- Mm-hmm.
- But I really don't want to
make it personal and sad,
<i>'cause I know it's gonna be sad</i>
<i>for me.</i>
It's just too much, too much.
I hope I don't cry.
-<i> Why would you cry?</i>
-<i> It's a lot of things.</i>
It's a lot of things.
- Like what?
- There's a lot of things
personal that I...
I wish I could say, but I can't.
- Made in the U.S.A.
Our main challenge today is to
shoot,
like, a 30-second public
service announcement
for our troops.
- Hey.
Can you hear my--
- Go ahead.
- "Right now I'm wearing no
clothes,
"because I don't want any brand,
any stereotypes to cover
who I am."
I don't want any brand to cover
my identify--my identity.
<i>You like it?</i>
- I didn't get it.
At the competition, Yara is a
very original girl,
and her personality help
her a lot.
But when it comes to talent
and performing,
I think Yara's still behind.
- Do you like that idea?
I'm gonna be naked.
- Yeah, but, baby, you gotta
let me write.
- Oh.
- You gotta let me write.
- I taught Shangela a few things
about makeup.
And today she doesn't want
to help me.
-<i> If I thought Yara needed</i>
<i>the help,</i>
I would help her,
but she doesn't.
<i>Girl, you can do it.</i>
-<i> Shangela and Alexis are like,</i>
<i>"Do your job."</i>
I know you're doing your job,
but before, I was doing my job,
and I helped you.
- So did you guys grow up
really, like, patriotic
and, like, "We love America"?
- I was born here, but I lived
in Indonesia
when I was a little boy,
and I remember thinking
of America as, like, the land
of candy bars and M&amp;Ms,
<i>so it was kind of a dreamland</i>
<i>for me.</i>
-<i> I know, it's kind of like</i>
<i>my mom,</i>
you know, coming from
a different country
where you're just like,
"America is the dream.
That's where I need to go."
- Being an American wasn't
something that was hard for me.
I was born into it.
<i>It was easy, but being</i>
<i>Carmen Carrera wasn't,</i>
and being married to my husband
wasn't.
I had to fight for all those
things,
so those are the things
that I'm really proud of.
[door opens]
- Well, hello, my star-spangled
ladies.
- Hi!
- I'm gonna check in and see
what you all are up to.
<i>Hi, Raja.</i>
What do you love about America?
- I love freedoms that I'm
allowed to have here.
I'm allowed to get in drag and
parade around the streets
and make money doing it.
- This needs to be uplifting,
entertaining,
and from the heart.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay? All right.
Carry on.
- All right.
- Hello, Manila.
- Hi.
- Why do you love America?
- There's just so many different
kinds of food here.
- So America to you means
a variety of different foods.
- Yes.
- What else does America mean
to you?
- Well, I think that is a symbol
of the diversity of America.
Different ethnicities and
cultures--they're all just
out here for the tasting.
<i>Try something new.</i>
Do it with an Indian guy.
- Now, of course, you are gonna
be talking
to the troops who are serving
this great nation of ours,
so we want you to express
yourself,
but just know that we want it to
come from the heart,
not come from between your legs.
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.
- Okay, thank you.
- I can't wait.
Carmen Carrera.
You, as you flutter your false
eyelashes--
is that what being an American
means to you?
- Yes.
I'm free, honey.
- Hello.
- No restrictions,
you know what I mean?
- Now, tell me what you have
planned for your P.S.A.
- My aunt has six boys,
and most of them are all
in the Army, the Navy.
I'm keeping in my mind that my
video's gonna get to them.
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia.
- Yes.
- Now, you're working on
your P.S.A.,
and you understand
where this will go.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- My dad is Army Reserve.
- Has he ever been shipped
overseas?
- Yes, to Iraq.
- Really?
- And you have no communication
with him.
I don't think I'm going
to mention
my father in that P.S.A.,
<i>'cause it's too emotional</i>
<i>for me.</i>
It was a very hard time
in my life.
- You have dialogue that you
will say.
Just give me a synopsis.
- If you don't love America,
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?
- [laughing]
- 'Cause you are America.
- It sounds so familiar.
- Yes.
- And you're just gonna stand
there.
You're not gonna do any of
the sensual Puerto Rican...
- I could be quiet.
- Yes.
- And I will express my cha-cha
inside.
- [laughing]
All right, Yara, I'll let you
get back to work.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Yes, Ru.
- Now, why are you proud to be
an American?
- Well, you know, my mom was in
Desert Storm twice,
and then she also fought
in Bosnia,
and she would call home, and she
would be like, "Make me laugh.
Tell me something funny."
so that's kind of the spirit of
what I want my P.S.A. to be.
All the way, wherever the
troops are,
I want to make them smile too.
- I'm excited.
- Yay. Me too.
- All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- America.
- America.
- What's it mean to you?
- It's love. It's freedom.
- Do you know anybody
in the military?
- [sighs]
Three years ago, I met somebody
very special in my life.
We get our relationship
very secretly,
and, like, the best moments
of my life was with him.
And he got called to go to
service,
and I don't know nothing about
him since, like,
a year and a half, so I really
don't know if he's okay.
- During the P.S.A.,
are you going to be speaking
directly to him?
- I would love to.
- What would you say to him
right now?
- I would say I'm sorry,
because I took us
in a wrong way.
Like, I felt abandoned,
and I didn't say anything before
he left.
I was really upset.
I want to say I'm sorry and that
I love him so much
and that I am very proud of him.
- Your story is shared by
thousands of others
who have had people they love go
overseas to serve their country.
I have a feeling yours is gonna
be very heartfelt.
But keep it entertaining, okay?
All right, kiddo, get to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, dolls, this one's
for Lady Liberty,
so do me proud and don't fuck
it up.
<i>I'll see you in a moment.</i>
[fanfare]
-<i> This week, for our main</i>
<i>challenge,</i>
we're filming a public service
announcement,
basically, to the troops
and to share about
loving being an American.
- Hello!
-<i> All right, you can use any</i>
<i>of the props you'd like,</i>
<i>including the pit crew.</i>
-<i> Mmm.</i>
- Your ten minutes starts now.
- You know what?
Here we go,
'cause nothing says "I love
America" like a dog.
Not only are you protecting
we humans,
but also the furrier kind.
- Cut.
Shangela, do you think you're
getting your message across
as to why you love America?
- It's because of the freedom
that we have here, the freedom
that you're out there
protecting.
- I wish you'd be saying this
right now to the camera.
- Okay, we'll do that.
- Every moment counts.
<i>[The Star-Spangled Banner</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tune]</i>
Oh, no, baby, I'm a solo act.
Y'all can go off now.
Thank you.
- Carmen, are you ready to do
your P.S.A.?
- Um...
- That's a yes or no answer.
- All right, well, let's just
start.
- Carmen, if I were you,
I would squat all the way down
and then come up.
Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.
- But don't do that.
-<i> Okay, okay, okay.</i>
All right,
the Statue of Liberty.
Hey!
No foam here!
-<i> Uh-huh, it's all real--</i>
100% American,
made in the U.S.A.
- All right, so I'm gonna be
in the mirror,
and then I'm gonna be doubting
myself.
I'm gonna be like, "Oh!"
you know, like, "Mm!
Maybe I'm not that pretty."
- Carmen, look at me.
Don't explain it, just do it.
30 seconds.
- The American dream for me is
to have, like, wigs
and jewelry and hot dogs
and balloons.
Ooh!
- I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm<i> puertorriqueña.</i>
I'm American girl!
Right now I'm not wearing
no clothes.
- Betsy Ross,
eat your heart out.
- Oh, definitely.
- This is where--
Oh, I'm sorry, and go.
I love America 'cause I'm --
ah, fuck.
I love America.
I le--ah, ah, fahh!
- Take a deep breath,
and you got it.
- It's okay.
- I love America
'cause America let me be...
[strumming guitar]
a musician.
I want to make the troops laugh.
<i>It's a hard time for them,</i>
<i>and they need to laugh,</i>
'cause laugh cures everything.
[shouting]
<i>[Mexican Hat Dance]</i>
Hey!
- Only in America will you
find the diversity of different
backgrounds and ethnicities,
and each of them offer a
different kind of food to eat.
And I love to eat food.
[imitating flatulence]
-<i> We got that.</i>
Let's see what else you have.
- Okay.
Ooh, sweet cherry pie.
Hold it like this so people can
see the length of it, honey.
Oh! Yes!
That was good.
Mmm!
- Manila, just bring it back
to America
and why you love America.
- Boys out there serving our
country,
when you come back,
there is going to be
all the food you can eat.
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God.
- My name is Raja.
I'm proud to be an American.
America, the land--
sorry.
The land where it--sorry.
- Can we get some of the joy
of what you're saying?
<i>I can see you reading</i>
<i>your script in your head.</i>
-<i> So far, all I've been able</i>
<i>to do</i>
<i>is just present this funny side</i>
<i>of me</i>
<i>or a very serious kind</i>
<i>of runway look.</i>
You think I could fit my giraffe
ass in there?
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> This is my opportunity</i>
<i>to just be pretty this time</i>
<i>and pinup-y.</i>
-<i> Anything you want to say</i>
<i>to our troops?</i>
- Um...
-<i> Look at the camera.</i>
- Speak from the heart.
- Oh.
God bless the troops.
- Mm, nice.
-<i> Oh!</i>
<i>- Alexis Mateo!</i>
- Hello!
- Wow!
- Hi, Michelle. Hi, Ru.
<i>I am very nervous about what</i>
<i>I have to say,</i>
because there's a lot of things
going in my mind right now
that are not that happy.
<i>But at this point, I just want</i>
<i>to go</i>
and do my best in front
of the camera.
-<i> Action!</i>
- It's time for a party.
It's a U.S.A. American
celebration!
I met the love of my life.
Now he serve in the U.S.
Military corps.
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!
-<i> Ooh, yeah.</i>
-<i> That's right, just pick it up.</i>
- Yeah, keep it going.
- And even if I was born on
the moon,
I would still be in America.
Sexy, no?
- What?
What did she say?
- Sexy, no?
This is so corny, I love it.
- [laughing]
- I think the troops are gonna
say,
"Who the hell is this crazy-ass
drag queen?"
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Get it, baby.
Only in America can a woman like
me have a freakin' chorizo!
- [laughing]
- Yes, baby!
Bam!
Oh!
-<i> Yeah, catch your breath.</i>
- You got a cramp, girl?
- I'm trying to feel where's
my genitals right now.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Ladies, thank you for serving
your country.
<i>Now, tomorrow I want you to</i>
<i>wear</i>
your most patriotic outfits
to the main stage,
where we will be joined by two
American icons.
<i>Swimsuit supermodel,</i>
the legendary Cheryl Tiegs
will be here...
all: Ooh!
- And Olympic figure skater
Johnny Weir.
- Word!
<i>Oh, my God, Johnny Weir.</i>
Love her!
<i>I'm gonna lick her if she gets</i>
<i>anywhere near me.</i>
- Good-bye for now,
and God bless America.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Yoo-hoo!
Show must go on.
- Good mornin'.
-<i> We're back in the workroom</i>
<i>this morning,</i>
and we are getting ready
for our patriotic runway.
- Do you guys think that it was
a little difficult
to be entertaining and heartfelt
at the same time?
- When you're not putting on an
act and you're being yourself,
it's not difficult to put your
feelings in front of everybody
at the same time being yourself.
- The way that I did mine was
that the spoken word
was heartfelt, and the visual
was entertaining.
- Did you speak in English
and Spanish?
- No, girl.
- But you speak Spanish,
don't you?
- No, I don't.
I understand Spanish.
- No, you speak Spanish.
- I speak broken Spanish.
- She does.
- You're Puerto Rican, right?
- Uh-huh.
But my mom is very Americanized.
- I would love to see Carmen
embrace Puerto Rican things.
-<i> I know Puerto Rican culture.</i>
It's always been part of my life
since I was little, but I think
that Yara and Alexis don't think
that I'm Puerto Rican enough,
which I don't care.
[upbeat music]
- Work, Marine Corps.
<i>I'm gonna wear</i>
<i>the military jacket,</i>
because no matter
what I'm wearing
and no matter
if I'm a drag queen
<i>I wanted to show respect</i>
<i>for the militaries</i>
and the Army,
<i>and I hope I look great.</i>
-<i> Ooh, you're so</i>
<i>Michael Jackson.</i>
<i>"Hee-hee!"</i>
-<i> That's a man.</i>
- This challenge
was kind of hard to me,
'cause I will like to entertain
and do happy things.
I don't want to remember
the year
that my father went to Iraq.
I miss my mom and my dad
so bad.
This challenge remembered me
my dad, of course.
He is Army Reserve.
-<i> I'm sure they miss you too.</i>
- Yes.
<i>A few years ago</i>
we didn't have my father, like,
on year,
and it was so, so hard.
Guys, I'm so loud.
Without me, the house sounds
really empty.
Sometimes when I'm next
to my father,
like, I drop things and--
"Oh!"
Like, watch out, girl!
Watch out, girl!
Don't be so gay here.
[laughs]
- And you get along with him
well?
-<i> Yes.</i>
- Yes. [laughs]
[RuPaul laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage?
- Yes, baby?
- God bless America.
And one of our forefathers,
Santino, is here.
<i>Hi, honey.</i>
I am so proud to be a part of
the Wig Party.
- I pledge my allegiance to you,
Ru.
- Good.
And Cheryl Tiegs,
the all-American girl, is here.
So glad you're here tonight.
- Thank you, sugar.
- And Johnny Weir is here
with us tonight.
Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, Ru, thanks for having me.
I am tucked in anticipation.
- Good. And keep it that way.
This week our queens were
challenged
to create patriotic
public service announcements
<i>to send to our troops overseas.</i>
Now, wearing their best
Yankee Doodle drag,
we salute them.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>Manila...</i>
<i>for the love of money.</i>
<i>- Great Gatsby, look at her.</i>
-<i> My patriotic look is a 1920s</i>
<i>flapper silhouette,</i>
<i>but instead of fringe,</i>
<i>it's hundreds,</i>
<i>because there's nothing more</i>
<i>American</i>
<i>than the American U.S. "d."</i>
-<i> In God we trust.</i>
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
<i>look at that pinup.</i>
-<i> The look for today's runway</i>
<i>is Carmen Carrera meets</i>
<i>Dita Von Teese in the 1950s.</i>
-<i> I love the stones accenting</i>
<i>the money bits in the back.</i>
-<i> Yes, the moneymaker.</i>
<i>Exactly.</i>
-<i> Star-spangled bang her.</i>
[laughter]
-<i> Alexis Mateo, giving you</i>
<i>military drag.</i>
-<i> An officer and a lady.</i>
-<i> I turned out a U.S. Official</i>
<i>uniform into a evening gown.</i>
-<i> I want to see where</i>
<i>the pistol's hidden.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>Who are you wearing?</i>
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
<i>Don't ask, don't tell.</i>
-<i> Exactly.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
[laughter]
-<i> Yara Sofia...</i>
<i>Now, this is a traditional</i>
<i>Puerto Rican costume, isn't it?</i>
-<i> Is it?</i>
-<i> Yeah, I saw it on a J.Lo</i>
<i>special.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> This is the national costume</i>
<i>from Puerto Rico.</i>
<i>It's very patriotic,</i>
<i>but there is a surprise.</i>
<i>- Oh, what's happening?</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- This is a traditional</i>
<i>Puerto Rican outfit.</i>
<i>- We see her rice</i>
<i>and her beans.</i>
-<i> Yes, we do.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>
-<i> Yara, did you double-park</i>
<i>your invisible plane?</i>
<i>This is Shangela.</i>
<i>A bouquet?</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
-<i> What I have to wear is simple,</i>
<i>but it's still patriotic.</i>
<i>It's like classic '50s,</i>
<i>Marilyn Monroe-esque,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna turn it</i>
<i>Shangie style.</i>
-<i> She's serving a little</i>
<i>Eva Longoria.</i>
-<i> A little bit of Marilyn Monroe</i>
<i>there for a second.</i>
-<i> Happy birthday, Mr. President.</i>
-<i> Oh, wow!</i>
<i>- Nava-ho.</i>
-<i> How!</i>
<i>- That's all I ever heard.</i>
-<i> I've chosen tonight to do</i>
<i>a look</i>
<i>that's a little bit</i>
<i>Native American</i>
<i>and a lot of rock and roll.</i>
-<i> "Dances with drag queens."</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>"Legend of the Walks Far</i>
<i>Woman."</i>
Welcome, my fellow
drag Americans.
- Yes.
- All right, let's get to it.
Let's start with Shangela.
Cheryl, what'd you think of
Shangela's runway presentation?
- The outfit is very, uh,
simple.
<i>You see the others--there's</i>
<i>a lot more going on.</i>
- The lame is coming off
a little lame for me.
You know, it's not quite
banging enough.
- Thank you, Amadeus.
- [laughing]
- Let's take a look at your
P.S.A.
- Hey, all you fierce-ass
freedom fighters, it's me,
Shangela, and let me tell you,
I appreciate you out there.
We miss you, and we want you
home safely...
<i>[The Star-Spangled Banner</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tune]</i>
Ooh!
Hallelu.
- [laughing]
- I thought you did a really
good job on your P.S.A.
<i>You knew exactly what you were</i>
<i>gonna do.</i>
- Hallelu.
[laughter]
- I felt like the costume,
the singing, everything was
so fun and vibrant.
- All right, next up,
Carmen Carrera.
- The Statue of Liberty--
ever since I was a child,
it has been a symbol of freedom,
acceptance, and diversity
for everyone to be able to live
the American dream.
Our forefathers have made it
possible for us,
and now it's you who's ensuring
the future of our children.
- Yes.
- Carmen, you have to stay
in character.
You have a tendency to,
dare I say, look bored.
-<i> That was my biggest thing.</i>
I wanted you to excite me
and make me want to sign up,
<i>but it was just very, very</i>
<i>soft.</i>
I just wanted a little bit more
command of the voice,
especially with this attitude
and this look that you've got.
- Carmen, when you first
came out, I gasped.
<i>It was very sultry.</i>
Standing here, you've lost that
a little bit.
- You're standing there like
you could really give two shits
about what we think.
- No, I don't want you
to think that.
- But that's how it's coming
across.
All right, ladies, next up,
Alexis Mateo.
Now, you told me in
the workroom
that you had a lover who went
to war.
Did you direct your P.S.A.
toward him?
- I tried to make my P.S.A.
a little bit underground message
for him.
Oh, my gosh, if he was watching
right now,
I would've loved to say that
I miss him a lot.
Inside my heart,
I'm still waiting for you.
- Well, let's take a look
at your patriotic P.S.A..
- It's Alexis Mateo<i> con sabor</i>
from Puerto Rico!
This is the only land
where you can grow up and become
whoever you want to be.
I'm a fucking drag queen!
Ha ha ha!
Bam!
Bam!
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!
Celebrate life.
Celebrate love.
Celebrate freedom.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ooh-ee.
- Bam, Michelle Visage.
- Bam!
<i>Alexis, you came out with one</i>
<i>thing you wanted to do.</i>
That was dance and be happy with
a piece of lame,
<i>and it worked.</i>
We couldn't breathe,
we were laughing so hard.
- Your P.S.A. was so much fun.
<i>"I'm a fucking drag queen!"</i>
<i>That sums it up.</i>
That's right, mama.
- Thank you, Beethoven.
Is this the jacket of
your ex-boyfriend?
- Yes, he left me this
as a memory.
So today I decide to wear it.
- If you're all covered up
in the high neck on the jacket,
<i>show us a little something.</i>
You know, you don't have
to show us everything.
I don't want to see your
honey basket.
- [laughs]
-<i> I love a queen in uniform.</i>
And you respected this,
and by "respect,"
I mean definitely put
Swarovskis all over it.
[laughter]
- All right, next up,
Yara Sofia.
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
- This is the national costume
for dancing.
It's called bomba.
This is also part
of their religion.
It's called Santeria.
- You're not gonna kill
a chicken, are you?
- No, no!
- 'Cause I'm hungry, girl.
Let's take a look and see
what happened.
- I'm Yara Sofia,
and I love America.
America let me be the Latina!
I feel free, darling!
Hey!
If you don't love America,
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?
- Okay,<i> guapa,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this is the deal.</i>
Your P.S.A.,
don't just be crazy.
If you're gonna be crazy,
be crazy with a purpose.
I expect more from you now,
Yara.
- It was a little bit crazy.
I'm not gonna lie.
<i>There wasn't a lot of class</i>
<i>and integrity in it.</i>
<i>I just thought it was kind of</i>
<i>jumping all over the place.</i>
- All right, next up,
our flapper, Manila.
Tell us about your look.
- Well, I'm trying to go for
a thoroughly modern millionaire.
-<i> Oh, I love it.</i>
Well, let's take a look
at your P.S.A.
- I'm an American,
and I love to eat out at
different kinds of restaurants.
Only in America will you find
the diversity
of different backgrounds
and ethnicities,
and each of them offer a
different kind of food to eat--
hot dogs, sushi, Italian,
kielbasa.
[imitating flatulence]
Oh, America, you taste so good.
- Being a lady, I am not quite
so sure
about when you emit some gas.
[laughs]
- Relying on a fart joke
in the P.S.A.,
<i>the message of having freedom</i>
<i>of choice</i>
<i>just got completely lost</i>
<i>for me.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Lagerfeld.
- [laughing]
-<i> Manila, I am so in love</i>
<i>with you tonight.</i>
I love everything about this
look on you.
<i>It's absolutely stunning to me.</i>
I just gotta be honest, I can't
stand you as a blonde girl.
-<i> The blond wig and the outfit,</i>
I just felt I saw
Jessica Simpson,
and I feel like I wouldn't want
to look like Jessica Simpson.
- All right, next up, Raja.
Can you get more American than
Native American?
- How.
- [laughing]
- Let's take a look at your
patriotic P.S.A.
- I'm Raja, and I'm proud to be
am American.
<i>Growing up in Indonesia,</i>
<i>my parents taught me that I</i>
<i>could be</i>
<i>whatever I wanted to be.</i>
<i>America--where the son</i>
<i>of immigrants</i>
can wear her freedom proudly.
- Raja, I thought you were
amazing on the runway.
The P.S.A. was a little stiff.
- Take me to your tepee.
- Okay.
- I saw Cher, like<i> Half Breed,</i>
Janis Joplin, and it's awesome.
- Thank you, Gandalf.
- [laughing]
- It's kind of like there are
two versions of being cold.
<i>The runway walk,</i>
<i>it's cold in a way</i>
that is so scorching and so hot
that you can freeze anyone
that's watching you.
And then when the video came up,
it was just a wet, dead fish.
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
<i>Now, while you go and untuck</i>
<i>in the Interior Illusions</i>
<i>lounge,</i>
the judges and I will
deliberate.
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>
[engine turning]
Now, just between us girls,
<i>what do you think?</i>
<i>Let's start with Shangela.</i>
- The fit on that dress
is horrid.
It's slightly American,
patriotic--slightly.
- I really feel that a polished
drag queen
would never come in that outfit
tonight.
- Right.
- The performance on the runway
tonight--it was just kind of...
- I thought her P.S.A. was kind
of canned.
Felt that it was kind of like
part of her shtick.
<i>Carmen Carrera...</i>
- The P.S.A.
was personality-less.
- Yeah.
- She was a stink-ball.
-<i> She did her beautiful walk.</i>
<i>She looked lovely,</i>
<i>and then she stood there,</i>
and she may as well have been
chewing on a piece of wheat,
<i>taking a dump, doing her nails.</i>
This girl, if she ever wants
to be a huge success--
people will not buy tickets,
she will not be able to pay
her rent,
and she will be flipping
burgers.
-<i> She will die penniless.</i>
- Yes.
-<i> Alexis Mateo...</i>
She seemed very somber
on the runway.
-<i> I liked the somberness,</i>
because she was being
a respectable
marine woman to me.
I felt like it was part
of the persona.
- I laughed hard at her P.S.A.
<i>I thought it was very funny.</i>
And her jumpsuit--
it was just amazing.
It was like the ugliest fabric,
but--and the silhouette was
so on point and so fun,
I couldn't take my eyes off
of her.
-<i> Yara...</i>
- I was really thrown when
I first saw her in that curly,
frizzy hair.
<i>I didn't like that, because she</i>
<i>was quite stunning,</i>
I thought, on the runway.
- This P.S.A. that's wild
and over-the-top,
it very shrill for me.
<i>You're constantly</i>
<i>going, going, going.</i>
When is it going to stop?
- Her P.S.A. Fell flat for me.
<i>Yara has to rein it in.</i>
- Right.
- It doesn't...
[blurting gibberish]
All the time have to be out
there like that.
- Let's move on to Manila.
- Manila lost me within the
first five seconds,
uh, because of going in the
direction of bathroom humor.
- It's comedy, people.
Why does everything have to be
so serious?
I appreciate a good crass video.
There's a lot of people like me
out there,
and I loved her runway look
tonight.
-<i> Raja...</i>
<i>- I like Raja.</i>
That costume, which was so
outrageous--
she just carried it,
and I really like that.
- As the pinup girl in her
P.S.A.,
really stunning, beautiful.
<i>But when she starts to speak,</i>
<i>there's a disconnect.</i>
- The message was beautiful,
but it was as flat as I was
before Dr. 90210.
- Hello.
- Okay?
- Silence!
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
Bring back my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>Based on your performance</i>
in the patriotic challenge
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Shangela, your runway
presentation
was underwhelming.
<i>And compared to the others,</i>
your P.S.A. Was just okay.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Manila...
you made a meal out
of this challenge.
But it left a bad taste in some
of the judges' mouths.
<i>You...</i>
are safe.
- Thank you.
- Carmen Carrera.
<i>You're pretty.</i>
<i>But your patriotic P.S.A.</i>
lacked pizzazz and personality.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
-<i> I'm in the bottom,</i>
<i>and I'm a little surprised.</i>
I'm not a mediocre bitch.
- Alexis Mateo,
<i>you turned sadness</i>
<i>into gladness</i>
and made us proud.
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner of this challenge.
[applause]
<i>You've won a three-piece,</i>
<i>super-lightweight,</i>
<i>luxury-luggage set from Antler.</i>
Yes, Antler.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say?
- [sighs]
I know some things that happen
in life--
<i>it teach you a lot of, like,</i>
<i>valuable lessons.</i>
And this one helped me to grow,
'cause I normally depend a lot
from people.
<i>And I want to say thank you</i>
to that special person
that's shown me
that I needed to love myself
first.
- Alexis, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
-<i> Raja...</i>
You pummeled the runway.
But when it came to the
challenge,
you stumbled.
Yara Sofia...
Your performance in the P.S.A.
was entertaining,
but are you resting on wacky?
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I am very in shock.
<i>I cannot breathe.</i>
<i>I cannot cry.</i>
<i>I cannot laugh.</i>
<i>I don't know why I am</i>
<i>in the bottom two.</i>
- Raja, you are safe.
<i>Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Prior to tonight, you were</i>
<i>asked</i>
<i>to prepare a lip-synced</i>
<i>performance</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Mickey</i><i> by Toni Basil...</i>
in Spanish.
- Yara doesn't have an advantage
over me
just 'cause she speaks Spanish.
I want to make this one one
for the history books.
-<i> Ladies, this is your</i>
<i>last chance</i>
to impress me
and save yourselves from
elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync...
<i>para tu vida!</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
And do not...
fuck it up.
[Toni basil singing in Spanish]
- Oh, my god, Carmen--
she knows every single word,
and she is just pooching
the song.
She better work, Heather.
- [laughing]
-<i> Yara was very patriotic,</i>
and she's doing Puerto Rico
very proud.
-<i> We are doing our lip sync,</i>
<i>and Carmen is kissing Johnny.</i>
<i>It's not kissing for your life.</i>
[applause]
-<i> Work, Carmen! Work!</i>
<i>Work, Yara!</i>
-<i> Ladies...</i>
I have made my decision.
Carmen Carerra...
shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia...
shante, you stay.
- [softly] What?
<i>Are you joking, Ru?</i>
No, no, do not joke that way,
please.
- For the first time in
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
no one is going home tonight.
This is the land of opportunity.
<i>And I've decided you both</i>
<i>deserve</i>
to stay and fight another day.
Now, remember, if you can't love
America,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
[laughing]
Can I get a "amen" in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play.
- Whoo-hoo!

00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,066
- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:07,433
- Rolaskatox is Roxxxy,
Alaska, and Detox.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,133
- I have narcolepsy.

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,900
[snores]

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,767
- You'll be writing
and recording

6
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,967
an inspirational anthem.

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,667
- Coco, there's a lot
of pressure on you

8
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,700
to start this out.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,800
- Yeah.
Thanks, Detox.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,467
- For what?

11
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:27,333
-<i> ♪ Can I get an amen ♪</i>

12
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,967
-<i> ♪ Just love yourself ♪</i>

13
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,867
- What's going on with you
and Detox?

14
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,200
- Rolaskatox.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,600
- No!

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,934
Cliques can be dangerous.

17
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,233
- Jinkx Monsoon.

18
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:42,233
- There was, like, 20 different
eras going on.

19
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,333
She's consistently a mess.

20
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,934
- This week's winner
is Ivy Winters.

21
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,033
- Thank you so much.

22
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,734
[giggles]

23
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,934
- Coco Montrese,
shantay, you stay.

24
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,633
Jade, sashay away.

25
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,500
- Thank you guys.

26
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:06,233
- Oh, Jade.

27
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,500
- "Cheers to my fish, fabulous,
and fierce sisters."

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,133
- We love you, Jade.

29
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,800
- Oh, God.

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,433
Bottom two twice.

31
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,200
I can't let Ru down anymore.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,567
I'm not gonna take it
for granted anymore.

33
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,700
So you bitches
better look the fuck out.

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,633
- Oh!

35
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,200
- Ivy, you won your challenge.

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,533
- I know!
- Congratulations.

37
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,667
[cheers and applause]

38
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:31,200
- And you always look amazing
on the runway.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,066
I had my fingers crossed I could
possibly win two challenges

40
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:37,533
in a row, but, I mean, Ivy,
it was very well-deserved.

41
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,467
- Jinkx likes to play
the "I think I did good,

42
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,266
"but I don't know.

43
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,800
They really hate my runways."

44
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,667
You're acting like
a little wounded girl,

45
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,767
and I'm fixing to call you out.

46
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,734
- Has everyone won
a challenge except--

47
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:52,734
have you won a challenge?

48
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:53,900
- Except me--a mini-challenge.

49
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,867
- And me, I haven't won.

50
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,233
- We're the only ones.

51
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,066
- It's just so hard
being here in Sharon's shadow.

52
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,567
She won four challenges.

53
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:05,066
This is not the place for me
to be supporting cast.

54
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:08,600
I have to show that I do
stand alone.

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,166
all: Rolaskatox.

56
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,367
- I don't want to be part of
Rolaskatox.

57
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,867
I want to be Alaska.

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,600
- The winner of<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> receives</i>

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,734
a sickening supply of

and a cash prize of $100,000.

64
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:40,467
And tonight, extra special
guest judges Leslie Jordan

65
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,066
and Absolut's Jeffrey Moran.

66
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,100
- Rolaskatox.
- Rolaskatox.

67
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,967
It's a new day in the WERK room.

68
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,667
I know what I have to do,
and I'm gonna do it.

69
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,400
Alaska!

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,700
- What?

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,400
- Oh, she said Alaska.

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,066
Did your friend leave y'all?

73
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,066
- No more Rolaskatox?

74
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,100
- We can't do cliques.

75
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,467
It's too dangerous.

76
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,900
I guess it's just Rotox now.

77
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,500
It's hard to say
to Detox and Roxxxy

78
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,066
that I don't want to be
in this little girl group

79
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,967
that we had together.

80
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,834
- Ooh, she broke the group up.

81
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,834
- Smart girl.

82
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,834
[alarm sounds]

83
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:23,967
- Ooh!

84
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,266
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.

85
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,500
<i>Hey, queens.</i>

86
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,467
all: Hey.

87
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:29,900
<i>- It's feeding time.</i>

88
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
<i>So if you've got a beef,</i>

89
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,266
<i>it's time to start slinging</i>
<i>sass and serving insults.</i>

90
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,433
- Ah!

91
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,867
<i>- But never ever let them</i>
<i>see you choke.</i>

92
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,166
<i>[chokes]</i>

93
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,433
all: Uh-oh!

94
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,900
- Hello, hello, hello.

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,600
all: Hi, Ru!

96
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,967
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

97
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:52,400
- Ladies, in the great
tradition of<i> Paris is Burning,</i>

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,967
get ready to visit the library,
darlings.

99
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,567
[cheers and applause]

100
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,367
Because reading is what?

101
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,333
all: Fundamental!

102
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,200
- That's right, that's right.

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
First up, Detox, the library
is open.

104
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,266
- Oh.

105
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,934
Roxxxy Andrews, condragulations
on the weight loss, but to me,

106
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,567
you're still Boxxxy Mandrews.

107
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,333
[all laugh]

108
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,400
Alyssa Edwards.

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,433
Overbites are very "in"
this season.

110
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:25,400
Too bad your performance here
is so underwhelming.

111
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,367
- Oh-oh!

112
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,767
- [laughs]

113
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,333
- Sharon Needles--what? No?

114
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,867
[all laugh]

115
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,400
I've had it.

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,166
- Jinkx Monsoon.

117
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,467
- Roxxxy Andrews, there are
two types of peanut butter,

118
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,734
creamy and crunchy.

119
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,800
[all laugh]

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,667
- I'm not crunchy, baby.

121
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,400
- Detox, you won the challenge.

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
You can take the chicken mask
off now.

123
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,266
[all laugh]

124
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,600
- [clucking]

125
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,934
- Roxxxy Andrews.

126
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:58,433
- Coco Montrese, for someone
who calls themself a top,

127
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,667
you sure do like
being on the bottom.

128
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,467
- Ooh!

129
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,834
[all laugh]

130
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:08,367
- Jinkx Monsoon,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

131
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,633
You're great at the challenges,

132
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,100
but on the runway,
you're a bust.

133
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,700
[all laugh]

134
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,100
- Detox, is Amanda Lepore
your mother?

135
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,266
'Cause there's a lot of silicone
going on there.

136
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,533
- Ooh.

137
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:23,200
- Jinkx Monsoon,
Boy George called.

138
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,066
He wants his hat back.

139
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,066
- [gasps]

140
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,867
- Ooh.

141
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,700
- Alyssa Edwards.

142
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,066
Never mind.

143
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,934
all: Ooh!

144
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,300
- Ivy Winters.

145
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,100
I can't do it
because reading you

146
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,633
is like reading
a Walt Disney book.

147
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,300
It's simply too easy.

148
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,800
[all laugh]

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,900
Detoxic.

150
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,367
Honey, I know you think
you're serving body and look,

151
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,233
but the only thing I'm getting
is<i> The Hills Have Eyes.</i>

152
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,500
- Uh-oh.

153
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,433
- Ms. Coco.

154
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,834
You must be blind
because it looks like

155
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,834
you're using Tang
for your highlights.

156
00:05:58,834 --> 00:05:59,834
- [laughs]

157
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,300
- Aah!

158
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,834
- Ms. Alaska, I think you should
wear a mask

159
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,166
for every challenge.

160
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,700
- [laughs]

161
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,533
I don't want to read
these girls.

162
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,767
I love them so mu--all right,
let's go.

163
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,066
[all laugh]

164
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,400
Alyssa Edwards, Miss USA--

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh, wait.

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
[all gasp]

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
- Why are you laughing?

168
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,700
- Detox, you're so seductive,

169
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,967
but unfortunately, it's illegal
to do it with you

170
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,433
because most of your parts
are under 18 years of age.

171
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,867
[all laugh]

172
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:34,166
Long story short, the season of
the fish smells like trout.

173
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,934
[all laugh]

174
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,767
I don't know what came over me.

175
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:44,667
- The library
is now officially closed.

176
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:50,300
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

177
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,900
Alaska.

178
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,433
[applause]

179
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,900
- Whoo!

180
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,166
- You shady bitch.

181
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,467
Ladies, for this week's
main challenge,

182
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,967
you're going to get
a chance to read...

183
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,066
me.

184
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,667
[all shout]

185
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,834
- Nuh-uh.

186
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,867
- You'll be competing
in the RuPaul Roast.

187
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,834
- Aah!

188
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:13,900
- Oh, my God.
- What?

189
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,433
- Proudly presented by Absolut.

190
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:20,767
Over 30 years ago, Absolut Vodka
was one of the first spirits

191
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,066
to support the gay and lesbian
community.

192
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,767
They were also the first
to launch

193
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,300
a citron and a mandarin vodka,

194
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,567
making the world
a fruitier place,

195
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,233
one cocktail at a time.

196
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:36,133
Now in that spirit, you need to
write and perform

197
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:40,467
outrageous material that really
lets me have it...

198
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,633
plus the judges...

199
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,066
plus each other.

200
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:48,166
No one's safe at a roast,
chickens.

201
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,633
Now to help you prepare,

202
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,633
you'll be working with
three professionals:

203
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,834
the shelarious Nadya Ginsburg...

204
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,333
- [gasps]
- Deven Green...

205
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,367
- Oh!

206
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,166
- And the one and only
Bruce Vilanch.

207
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,300
[all cheering]

208
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,066
- Alaska, you won the
mini-challenge,

209
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:08,166
so you'll decide the order
of the presenters.

210
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,600
- Oh.

211
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,233
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.

212
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:15,934
And may the best woman win.

213
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,200
- Does anyone have a preference
as to going early, late?

214
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,533
'Cause I don't want to fuck
anyone over.

215
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,300
- I would prefer to go
just in the middle.

216
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
- In the middle? Okay.

217
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,333
- Me too, in the middle
for me too.

218
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,367
- I want to go after you.

219
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,500
- Where are you
putting yourself?

220
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,300
- No one wants to go first.

221
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,400
But, I mean, I don't mind
going first.

222
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,767
Is that okay?

223
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,700
- Yeah.

224
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
- That's the hardest one.

225
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,967
Wrong move.

226
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,567
- This challenge is important

227
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,166
because everyone knows me
as a comedy queen.

228
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,700
So there's high pressure
right now

229
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,066
to put my money
where my mouth is.

230
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,200
- It's so hard to think of,

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,467
like, mean things to say
about her.

232
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,967
- Ivy's very sweet
and well-mannered.

233
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,100
And in a roast,
that's gonna be hard.

234
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,734
- I am just trying to, like,
really rack my brain.

235
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:04,567
And I still can't think
of one joke.

236
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,567
- Coming up...

237
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,867
- I put myself first.

238
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,100
- Are you going for
Miss Congeniality

239
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
or America's next
drag superstar?

240
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,200
- Girl, that's fake to me.

241
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,266
- I'm not acting when I say
I'm insecure about things.

242
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,767
- Bullshit.

243
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,166
- [laughs]

244
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,233
[laughs]

245
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,900
- The main challenge this week
is to roast RuPaul,

246
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,333
as well as our fellow queens
and the judging panel.

247
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,867
I just have to kick ass at it,

248
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,600
because at a drag show,
when you bomb,

249
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,834
you don't just hear crickets.

250
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,367
You hear shotguns
getting cocked.

251
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,133
- I can't read this last one.

252
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,266
Because they're gonna be like,
t--

253
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,500
Humph.

254
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
- I keep hearing, "Ooh!"

255
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,300
- Oh, my gosh.

256
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
- "Ooh, um--"

257
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,400
- [mutters]

258
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,533
- "Oh, no, I can't."

259
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,667
- Oh, my gosh, y'all.
I can't do it.

260
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,934
I'm gonna have to rewrite it.

261
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,567
I'm gonna read y'all
the beginning of mine.

262
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:06,900
Tell me if it's too much.

263
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,767
"RuPaul, where should I start?

264
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,734
"With the cracked-out
beginning of your career

265
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:16,166
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance?"

266
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,500
Oh, my gosh.

267
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,700
Y'all, am I just gonna be too--

268
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Is that too much, Roxxxy?

269
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,667
[laughs]

270
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,734
[rubs hands together]

271
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,300
- She's saying her jokes
are so much

272
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,800
and she says her joke, bitch,
and you can hear crickets.

273
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,333
- I can't.

274
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,200
I can't.
I can't.

275
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
- You go back in your corner,

276
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,533
and you figure it the fuck out
and come back and talk to us

277
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,934
when you got
something together.

278
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,000
Darling.

279
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,567
- Hello, hello, hello.

280
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,700
[all shout]

281
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,467
- Oh, my!

282
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,567
- No, no, no.

283
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,033
- Since nobody knows RuPaul
better than me,

284
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:51,667
I am here to help you all
with your roast material.

285
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,500
- Oh, my God.

286
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,166
- Hello, Alaska.

287
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,200
- Hi.

288
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,133
- Tell me what you got.

289
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,333
You're a smart one.

290
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,800
- Well, I'm hitting her music,
her movies--

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,066
- What about the music?

292
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,667
- Ru, your music
is so auto-tuned

293
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,900
you make Cher sound like
Susan Boyle.

294
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,834
- [laughs]

295
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,867
Good.

296
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,834
It's so nice to see Alaska
again.

297
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:12,800
- Hi.

298
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,867
- Now, you won
the mini-challenge.

299
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:14,867
- Yes.

300
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:15,900
- So you were in charge
of the order.

301
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,233
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,667
- So how did you decide how
everybody was gonna go?

303
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,834
- I asked everyone if they have
a preference

304
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,367
as to if they want to
go in the beginning,

305
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,700
the middle, the end.

306
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,066
And I put myself first.

307
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,233
- Yeah, are--are you going for
Miss Congeniality

308
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,500
or America's
next drag superstar here?

309
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
- Um--

310
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,400
- In the end, someone's gotta
go down, right?

311
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,467
- Yeah.
- It could be you.

312
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,600
See you at the roast, baby.

313
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,967
Hi, Roxxxy girl.

314
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,400
- Hi, Michelle.

315
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,367
- Does this challenge
make you nervous?

316
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,433
- Reading is something
I've always done

317
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,700
to the queens at the bar.

318
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
You know, they think I'm a mean
girl anyways, but--

319
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,967
- How do you plan on reading
somebody like Ru?

320
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,200
- Her music, how she sings.

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,467
- How does she sing?
- It's auto-tune.

322
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,934
- Auto-tune seems to be
a common thing so far.

323
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,967
So you might want to listen,
and if something's repeated,

324
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,266
take it out or make it funnier--

325
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,633
- Than the person before you.

326
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,600
- Yes.

327
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,667
- And I can be funnier
than Alaska.

328
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,967
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

329
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,300
- Keep it funny.
That's all we can tell you.

330
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,066
- Yes, ma'am.

331
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,667
- Ivy Winters.

332
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,600
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?

333
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,934
- A little bit nervous,
to be honest.

334
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,533
I don't consider myself
a comedian,

335
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,667
so it's definitely
a challenge for me.

336
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,867
- What kind of topics are you
gonna be roasting Ru on?

337
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,567
- I know he wears
amazing costumes,

338
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,867
so I think I'm gonna
kind of hit on that.

339
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,567
- How are Ru's dresses funny?

340
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,467
I mean, they're flawless.

341
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,767
Give me another one.

342
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,567
- Um, I know Santino being
a sewer and he designs, um--

343
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,100
- Some sewing jokes?

344
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,066
Doesn't sound too funny.

345
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,867
Your page is empty.

346
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:53,533
- I think I've ripped out,
like, five pages.

347
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,767
I'm really trying to rack
my brain.

348
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,467
- Keep racking.

349
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,967
I'm gonna let you back at it.

350
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,433
Keep on keeping on, baby.
- All right.

351
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,800
- Coco Montrese.

352
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,533
Hi, gorgeous.

353
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,700
- How are you?

354
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,300
- How are you feeling about
this challenge?

355
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,433
- I'm not a comedian by--
by far,

356
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,133
but I'm taking a different
approach than, you know,

357
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,734
a lot of the other girls
in this competition.

358
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,734
I'm gonna be Coco Montrese,

359
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,533
Ru's old childhood friend
from the Brewster Projects.

360
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,834
- Okay.

361
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,934
I think it's important for you,
this challenge, Coco.

362
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:25,600
- Very.
I've been in the bottom twice.

363
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,367
- So let's deliver
this shit.

364
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,300
- I will deliver.

365
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,633
- All right.
- Thanks.

366
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,066
No RuPaulogies.

367
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm not gonna apologize anymore.

368
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,066
I'm gonna show him
what I'm made of.

369
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,767
- Alyssa Edwards.

370
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:43,066
- Miss Michelle,
the first lady, how are you?

371
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,700
- I love it.

372
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Are you a funny queen, Alyssa?

373
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,567
- With reading, some people
can take it personal.

374
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:54,500
- Okay, they can take it
personally if it's not funny.

375
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,567
But if it's funny,
you're almost forgiven.

376
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,633
It's, like, given a pass.

377
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,066
- Right.

378
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,066
But you know when you're with
your friends, and you're like,

379
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,367
"Girl, that outfit is tired
and ridiculous.

380
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,433
You look late.
Bitch, you need to go change."

381
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,834
- That's not a joke.
That's a read.

382
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,734
- It is, but it's still
being funny.

383
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,800
- It's not a joke.

384
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,166
- Not a joke, no.

385
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,567
And I've taken it personal

386
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,400
before because I had a girl
in this competition tell me

387
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,066
I was fat in my costume.

388
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,567
- It's not a joke.

389
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,867
Gotta be funny.
- Okay.

390
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:26,200
- It has to be joke after joke
after joke.

391
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
All right, so I'm gonna let you
go back to your work.

392
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,967
- Okay, thank you, Michelle.
- All right, baby.

393
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,300
Good luck.

394
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,633
All right, ladies.
Gather round.

395
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,367
In a moment, you'll be meeting
with your comedy coaches.

396
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:42,266
And tomorrow we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judges,

397
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:44,433
star of TV and stage,
Leslie Jordan...

398
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,467
[all cheer]

399
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:50,066
And Absolut Vodka guru,
Jeffrey Moran.

400
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,200
- Oh, yay.

401
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
- So come decked out in
your swankiest cocktail attire.

402
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Oh, and one more thing.

403
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,567
You'll be roasting Ru
in front of a live audience.

404
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,600
- Oh, my gosh!

405
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,700
[all shout]

406
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,834
- Oh, shut up!

407
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:08,066
- So don't fuck it up.

408
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,166
Byesies.

409
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,467
- Bye.

410
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
- [snores]

411
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,433
I do have narcolepsy,

412
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:24,900
and in the moment where I'm most
worried about my jokes,

413
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,166
my body
starts to shut down.

414
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,133
- You might think I want to say
"Jinkx, wake up."

415
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,266
But sorry, girl.

416
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:43,800
- [snores]

417
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,066
- Coming up...

418
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:49,233
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up?

419
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,867
[laughs]

420
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,700
- It has to be funny.

421
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Seriously.

422
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,233
- [laughs]

423
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,700
[laughs]

424
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,467
- Jinkx is here.

425
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,967
- Hi, Jinkxy.
- Hi, Jinkx.

426
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,934
- Our coaches today are
Deven Green, Bruce Vilanch,

427
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,867
and Nadya Ginsburg.

428
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,734
I am most shaken by Deven Green.

429
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:15,633
I have been doing her "welcome
to my home" video shtick

430
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,100
for years.

431
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,834
So I'm just gonna rattle through
all of this.

432
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,066
- Cool.

433
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,533
- RuPaul, you are pulled--

434
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,900
[clears throat]

435
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,667
RuPaul in her heyday would have
made--ah.

436
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,400
I ruined it.

437
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,333
- Stop being such an adult,
and be a fun-loving performer.

438
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,734
- Okay.

439
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:40,934
My career as a comedian
might be on the line here.

440
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:46,200
- RuPaul, how do you get to be
supermodel of the world?

441
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,333
When you find out,
can you let me know?

442
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,767
- Well, that is a starting point

443
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,633
for somewhere
that you didn't go.

444
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,433
Just go deeper, as somebody
once said to me

445
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,834
who I never dated again.

446
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,433
- Don't be afraid to go out
there and really be as vicious

447
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,433
as you can because that's
the name of the game.

448
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,467
- I would write that down.

449
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,066
It's a great note.

450
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,767
- I'm writing that down.

451
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,367
- Let's talk about
Michelle Visage.

452
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,367
Everybody, Michelle Visage.
She's lovely.

453
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,233
Who did your boob job, Michelle?

454
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,533
Boobsforqueens.com?

455
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,600
They--they do breast plates
for drag queens.

456
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,967
- I think you need something
a little easier to process.

457
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,700
Just make sure you really
drive it home.

458
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,066
- Coco!

459
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,066
- Tomorrow I'm just going with

460
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,734
I'm Ru good friend
from the projects.

461
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,100
Ru don't know I'm gonna be here.

462
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
You know, straight from
the hood.

463
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,233
It's gonna be a stretch for me.

464
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,266
- [laughs]
- All right.

465
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,066
- I'ma say, "you know, Ru,

466
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,700
"I want to know
what you gonna do

467
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,967
"when that entourage of makeup
artists you got go on strike.

468
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,433
I seen you do your makeup
by yourself, fool."

469
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,400
- I would be mindful of--
it should be light-hearted,

470
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,700
not malicious and mean-spirited.

471
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,300
- Like her face has been beat

472
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,433
more times than Susan Lucci
at the Daytime Emmys.

473
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,633
- Right.

474
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:02,133
- Coco is not a comedian.

475
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,800
But RuPaul's long lost friend

476
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
from the Brewster Projects
is a comedian.

477
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,166
She tell it like it t-i-is.

478
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,500
And she ain't apologizing for it
while she pat her weave.

479
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,367
- Okay, Mr. RuPaul Charles.

480
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,633
After your less award-earning
role in<i> Starrbooty,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

481
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,500
you should not only sashay away,

482
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,066
but jump off a damn cliff.

483
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,233
[laughs]

484
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,433
- I think the general rule
in a roast is

485
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:34,066
it's great to be evil,
but it has to be funny.

486
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:37,567
You gotta have a couple of
jokes, seriously.

487
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,767
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up

488
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:45,233
with your
no-drag-knowledge mouth?

489
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,300
[laughs]

490
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,200
- Do you have any more jokes?

491
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,734
- [chuckles]

492
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,100
- I'll just start with my whole
spiel about Leslie Jordan.

493
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,300
The movie<i> The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is chock-full</i>
of unbelievable performances.

494
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,066
The most unbelievable is you
being a heterosexual.

495
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:05,066
Leslie, you're gayer than George
Michael fucking Elton john.

496
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,367
- It's important
that you not rush.

497
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,433
Take your time.

498
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,800
- And find the funniest nugget.

499
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,266
Take it even one step further
with some of the punch lines.

500
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,967
- Ru and the rest of the judges
are expecting a lot out of me.

501
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,133
I have to be funny.

502
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,867
- Roxxxy.

503
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:23,967
Let's hear your material.

504
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,467
- Okay, let's start with Ru.

505
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:29,533
Your laugh is as fake as
Lee Press-On Nails.

506
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,367
They're sticky, annoying,
and never fun.

507
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,967
Then again,
so is Alyssa Edwards.

508
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,066
- What do you call it
when you flatline?

509
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,100
- You're dead.

510
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,400
- Code blue.

511
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,533
- Thank you.

512
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:43,533
More, more.

513
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,700
What else do you have?

514
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,834
- Yeah, what else--what are
your other jokes?

515
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,967
- Okay, the other one I have for
Ru is

516
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,166
"Ru, your acting to me
is very cute.

517
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,800
Unlike all the girls that are
left in this competition."

518
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,100
- Well, that's--
it's not really funny.

519
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,934
It's just an insult.

520
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:00,734
- When the coaches completely
rejected what I was giving them,

521
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,533
it threw me, and I'm completely
defeated.

522
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,166
Like, first joke off the bat
was just, like,

523
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,700
"Oh, mm, you're not
making us laugh.

524
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,033
Okay, what else do you have?"

525
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,033
And I was like...

526
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm, like, redoing my whole
script right now.

527
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,900
That was the first time I just
wanted, like, to leave and cry.

528
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
It sucks.

529
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,333
[sighs]

530
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,166
- Today we will be roasting
the legendary Ms. RuPaul.

531
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,767
Not only am I nervous
that we're doing comedy,

532
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,300
but it's in front of
a live audience.

533
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,934
Honey, tonight I am shaking
in my pumps.

534
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,066
- Ms. Jinkx standing over there

535
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,600
looking like the mad hatter
right now.

536
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,700
What's this challenge?

537
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,033
<i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

538
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,300
- Coco, why are you still doing
your ventriloquist dummy makeup?

539
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,100
all: Ooh!

540
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,633
- Jinkx try to act like
she innocent

541
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:04,767
and that she's not reading.

542
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,300
- I don't act
like I'm innocent.

543
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,900
- Now, Ms. Jinkx, I want to ask
you this for real, girl.

544
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,500
Do you feel like you deliver
glamour?

545
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,066
- I don't think I deliver
anything but what I deliver.

546
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,667
And what I've been delivering
lately

547
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,734
has been a big, old confusion.

548
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,467
- That's all bullshit.

549
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm not believing that.

550
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,967
- You ain't buyin', Ms. Roxxxy?

551
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,333
She's sellin', and you ain't
buyin'?

552
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,934
- I ain't buyin' shit.

553
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,266
You come across as
"I don't think I'm gonna win,

554
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:32,066
but I'm just here doing good
until I can't do good anymore."

555
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,567
- I feel like sometimes when I
do well in the challenges,

556
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,500
I don't really get to feel
that great about it

557
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,300
because I get
beat down on the runway.

558
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,867
It's my own thing I'm tackling.

559
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:41,967
- Girl, that's fake to me.

560
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,300
You know what you can do,

561
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
but you play the card
as the innocent,

562
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,100
"I don't know.
Maybe I'm in the bottom two."

563
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,133
And I feel like, you know--

564
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,767
- Yeah, it's just like,
really, girl?

565
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,500
- I'm not acting when I say I'm
insecure about things, though.

566
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,900
- Ms. Jinkx, you know exactly
what I'm saying,

567
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,367
you know
what role you're playing.

568
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,734
- I know what you're saying,
and I do not agree with you.

569
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,266
It is not an act when I tell you
I'm nervous about shit.

570
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,533
That's how I feel.

571
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,967
- Okay, well, girl,
if you're not gonna take

572
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,300
the constructive criticism

573
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,500
and how I'm just trying to
explain to you how I feel.

574
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,433
- Many jokes and two faces...

575
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,467
- Ooh!

576
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,633
- Jinkx Monsoon!

577
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,800
- [laughs]

578
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,934
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

579
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:42,233
Michelle Visage, are you ready
for some roasting?

580
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,100
- Bring it on, bitches.

581
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,400
- [laughs]

582
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,734
Santino Rice.

583
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,467
- I am ready to get ribbed for
her pleasure.

584
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,300
- [laughs]

585
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,633
Leslie Jordan, are you scared
just a little bit?

586
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,500
- Terrified.

587
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,433
- Good. You should be.

588
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,667
Absolut's Jeffrey Moran,

589
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,567
what flavor of Absolut
would this be?

590
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,967
- Absolut Pears in the
Garden of Good and Evil.

591
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,900
- Mm, evil.

592
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,800
This week we challenged
our queens

593
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,533
to sharpen their comedic skills
in the first ever

594
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,200
RuPaul Roast.

595
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
So enjoy your Absolut cocktails,

596
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,533
and remember, if you can't laugh
at yourself,

597
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,633
how in the hell are you
gonna laugh at somebody else?

598
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,300
[laughs]

599
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,600
Gentlemen, start your engines.

600
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,367
And may the best woman win.

601
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,500
Coming up...

602
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
- You know at the beginning
of the show

603
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,133
you come in the room, girl,
pants so high.

604
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:39,333
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.

605
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,500
[all laugh]

606
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,133
- [laughs]

607
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,900
[laughs]

608
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,367
[cheers and applause]

609
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:54,767
- Hello, everyone, and welcome
to the first ever RuPaul Roast.

610
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,700
[cheers and applause]

611
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,967
You all know Leslie Jordan.

612
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,300
[cheers and applause]

613
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,600
Don't lie.
No, you don't.

614
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
[all laugh]

615
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,066
Leslie Jordan is the only man
on earth

616
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,066
to have fucked more gay men
than Michelle Visage.

617
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,700
[all laugh]

618
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,233
Michelle Visage.

619
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,800
You can take the girl
out of New Jersey,

620
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,567
but you can't keep the girl
from giving blow jobs

621
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:21,066
to homeless men
along the New Jersey turnpike.

622
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,133
But we're here
celebrating RuPaul.

623
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,233
RuPaul, you've been
in the industry

624
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:31,767
a long, long, long, long, long,
long, long time.

625
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,100
RuPaul is so old that
the Hindenburg disaster

626
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,900
nearly destroyed
her bat mitzvah.

627
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,266
[all laugh]

628
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:42,734
RuPaul is so old that her
colostomy bag is made of wood.

629
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:44,834
[all laugh]

630
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,166
RuPaul is so old that
when she opens her legs,

631
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,266
all you hear is--

632
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,567
[raspy exhale]

633
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,934
[all laugh]

634
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,567
She's done movies, music,
television,

635
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:59,133
and I have just one thing
to say.

636
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,667
Please stop immediately.

637
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,533
[all laugh]

638
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,967
Thank you, mama.
We love you.

639
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:10,600
[cheers and applause]

640
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,734
It is my great pleasure
to bring to the stage

641
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,900
our next "entertainer."

642
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,066
Roxxxy Andrews.

643
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,800
And that's Roxxxy with three Xs,

644
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,266
just like her dress size.

645
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:24,467
- Oh!

646
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,467
- Thank you, Alaska...

647
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,166
a tired, boring, weird,

648
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,233
second-rate version
of your husband.

649
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,967
[audience ohs]

650
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,066
You know, RuPaul, you love it
for all of us

651
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,767
to call you our mom.

652
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:38,867
How the fuck
can I call you my mom

653
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,567
if you're as old
as my grandpa?

654
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,467
[faint laughter]

655
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:46,367
Michelle Visage,
with that much makeup,

656
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:51,433
all of your wigs, and...

657
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:52,967
light on your face,

658
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:57,200
maybe we should call you...

659
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,700
Michelle Mirage.

660
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,500
[scattered laughter]

661
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,567
RuPaul, I want to thank you
for having me here tonight.

662
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,700
- Y'all, I'm so happy
to be here.

663
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,633
I never been out the house.

664
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,934
It's been a long time, y'all.

665
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:14,467
I'm Ru good cousin
from the Brewster Projects.

666
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:15,800
She didn't know I was
coming tonight.

667
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,066
You didn't know I was gonna be
here, did you?

668
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:18,433
- [laughs] No.

669
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:20,066
- And Michelle--you go back
with Michelle

670
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,333
farther than you go back
with me.

671
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,166
You knew Michelle when Michelle
was Michael.

672
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:28,100
[all laugh]

673
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,266
So I'm flipping through the
channels, I say, "You seen Ru?

674
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,734
Ru on TV!"

675
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:36,800
I say, "What the hell is he
thinking?"

676
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,066
You know, at the beginning
of the show,

677
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,333
you come in the room, girl.

678
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,567
"Hello, hello!"

679
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,934
Girl, you look like the black
Pee Wee Herman.

680
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:46,800
[all laugh]

681
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,266
Pants so high.

682
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:51,166
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.

683
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:55,100
[riotous laughter]

684
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,433
[cheers and applause]

685
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,800
- It's gonna be hard to top
Coco.

686
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,066
But look at her.

687
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,233
Who would want to top Coco?

688
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:07,133
[all laugh]

689
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:10,567
Michelle Visage is so full
of semen.

690
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,533
Period.

691
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:12,967
[all laugh]

692
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,066
No, seriously.

693
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,533
She's a whore.

694
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:20,133
Now on to the grand
high bitch herself.

695
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,934
Ru, what I admire most about you
is your ability

696
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,934
to look at these tired queens

697
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:29,400
and always find
a compliment for them.

698
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,200
You're so full of shit,
the toilet's jealous.

699
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,734
[all laugh]

700
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:38,834
Give it up for RuPaul.

701
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,300
- Hello, everyone.

702
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:48,400
Having sex with Santino is a lot
like Ru's music career...

703
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,367
Awkward.

704
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,533
- You would know.

705
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,166
- [laughs]

706
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,734
- I feel like
whenever Michelle farts,

707
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,500
a fairy gets her wings.

708
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,700
[all laugh]

709
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,433
Speaking of fairies,

710
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:03,834
hello, Leslie.

711
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:08,133
RuPaul, with these long legs
and feathers you like to wear,

712
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,767
you're one step away
from looking like

713
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,367
Big Bird's grandmother.

714
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,533
[audience oohs]

715
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,600
[cheers and applause]

716
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,400
- I thought I had auditioned
for<i> RuPaul's Next--</i>

717
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,433
[microphone feedback]

718
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,600
<i>Drag queen of the year.</i>

719
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
[microphone feedback]

720
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,834
Little did I know I was walking

721
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,166
into the largest cross-dressing
convention of all time.

722
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,967
[scattered laughter]

723
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,800
But this is about you,
mother Ru...

724
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,700
From the cracked-out nights
in the bathroom

725
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,233
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance.

726
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,467
This was the best bunch
of people

727
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,934
you could get to come judge?

728
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,834
Can I get a gay man?

729
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:55,300
Santino Rice, what the hell you
know about winning something?

730
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,233
But you and Coco Montrese do
share something in common, okay.

731
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,233
And that's not only
your foolish wardrobe,

732
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,066
but being a runner-up--

733
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,066
- Oh...

734
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,500
- Don't get bitter.

735
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,600
Just get better.

736
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,066
[microphone feedback]

737
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,066
I thank you, and good night.

738
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:13,100
[applause]

739
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,934
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

740
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:16,100
Wasn't he delightful?

741
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,967
[all laugh]

742
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:21,600
God bless him,
he tried his hardest.

743
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,533
Oh, fuck.

744
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,800
Where do I fucking start?

745
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,066
Oh, God.

746
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,433
Let's start with Leslie Jordan.

747
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,066
It's great to see you.
[chuckles]

748
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,834
<i>The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is one of my most</i>
favorite movies of all time.

749
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,533
And your performance
was quite unbelievable.

750
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:39,300
Because you played
a heterosexual male.

751
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,066
You are fucking gayer than the
Fire Island production of<i> Rent.</i>

752
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,533
[all laugh]

753
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:47,900
But enough with that old queen.

754
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,066
Let's talk about the other
old queen on the panel,

755
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,600
Michelle Visage.

756
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,066
[all laugh]

757
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:56,934
Let me just look at my little
notes really quick, fuck.

758
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:59,367
God, I had to write little
to fit all this in.

759
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,633
[laughter]

760
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,200
Oh, Jesus Christ.

761
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,333
Michelle's favorite movie in the
world is<i> Showgirls.</i>

762
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,734
And much like Nomi Malone,

763
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,800
she relies on the talents
of her black friend.

764
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,066
[all laugh]

765
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:15,233
Ru, you are a fucking legend.

766
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:17,900
And I just hope that you're
having the time of your life.

767
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,367
Because you don't have much time
left.

768
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:24,066
[all laugh]

769
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,033
Good night, you guys.

770
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,834
Thank you so much
for coming out.

771
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:30,667
[cheers and applause]

772
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,700
- Coming up...

773
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,333
- You were trying too hard.

774
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,600
- It was boring,
it was humiliating,

775
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,934
and uncomfortable to watch.

776
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:40,834
- Wah-wah.

777
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,233
- [laughs]

778
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:44,734
[laughs]

779
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:50,467
Ladies, it's time for the
judges' critiques.

780
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,333
Let's start with Alaska.

781
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,433
- Hi.

782
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,300
- Comedy is like music.

783
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,467
It's something you hear
or you don't.

784
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,934
And you definitely
hear the music.

785
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,400
- Thank you.

786
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,233
- I thought you looked
beautiful tonight in your LBD.

787
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,900
And up there at the podium,
you were very funny,

788
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,633
but it's tough to go first.

789
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,166
You really should have taken it
even further.

790
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,633
- Moving on to Ivy Winters.

791
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:15,633
- Hey.

792
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:16,633
- We both wore green.

793
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,600
- I know.
- Yeah.

794
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,500
- You wore it best.
- [laughs]

795
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,166
- Tonight--I love you in green,
I love the red hair.

796
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,266
Not sure about the gloves.

797
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,633
- I love the gloves.

798
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,233
- I don't think you need them.

799
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,700
- During the roast, your
cards were a bit of a crutch,

800
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,934
and you kept looking at them.

801
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,567
- And you seemed
so unsure of yourself.

802
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,233
You were so nervous.

803
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,667
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.

804
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,200
- You have a career in or out
of drag in comedy.

805
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
You killed.

806
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,633
- Thank you.

807
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:47,266
- Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.

808
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:51,066
Let's start with
the runway look...

809
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,066
I love it!

810
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:53,066
- [laughs]

811
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,367
- Right hair, right makeup.

812
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:55,900
I am so friggin' proud of you.

813
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,433
- To hear that from
Michelle Visage, oh, my God,

814
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:02,066
that was worth its weight
in gold.

815
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:03,066
- Detox.

816
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,066
- Hi.

817
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,834
- You were so mean to me.

818
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,734
But there was a twinkle
in your eye.

819
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,667
Your tongue was firmly planted
in your cheek.

820
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,800
- The one thing I wasn't fond of

821
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,767
was you relying too much
on the word "fuck."

822
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,066
You can let the room breathe.

823
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,934
It's okay.
It was too much.

824
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,600
- Alyssa Edwards.

825
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,166
- You could have been
a little funnier.

826
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,734
And I thought you were trying
too hard.

827
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:29,066
- Going into the mic
and holding on, like,

828
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:32,133
for dear life,
I thought that was nerves.

829
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,600
But you're so gorgeous.

830
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,633
- Thank you.

831
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,934
- It wasn't your best moment
tonight.

832
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,567
- Okay.
- It was boring.

833
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:41,567
It was humiliating
and uncomfortable to watch.

834
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,200
- Coco Montrese.

835
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,533
- Not a roast, but a toast.

836
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:45,867
Mazel tov.
It was really spectacular.

837
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,500
- Thank you.
- Well done.

838
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,567
- Wanda Sykes, move over.

839
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,567
[all laugh]

840
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,066
It was hilarious.

841
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:54,066
- Tonight on the runway,
I like your look.

842
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:56,467
I'm thinking the earrings
and your roots showing,

843
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,734
it added to the humor.

844
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,467
- Roxxxy Andrews.

845
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,500
- Keep your pace up.

846
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,934
You needed to be quicker.

847
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,700
- It wasn't as smooth.

848
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,834
You could have strung it
together better

849
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,734
so that it was
much more fluid.

850
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,734
- Tonight your dress
is high-end,

851
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:16,066
and you really needed
some bigger hair to go with it.

852
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,066
- Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

853
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,100
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

854
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,533
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

855
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,600
the judges and I
will deliberate.

856
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:30,600
Just between us roasted
chickens, what do you think?

857
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Let's start with Alaska.

858
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,066
- Her look
is so predictable now.

859
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,433
- So you want to see
a different silhouette.

860
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,834
- Just once at least.

861
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,367
- Being first means you have
a little more expectation

862
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,667
to step out of the box.

863
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:42,967
But a lot of the things,

864
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,200
it's like, I sort of expected
them.

865
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,367
- I just loved her.

866
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,567
She just, like, the kind of
knock-kneed,

867
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,567
and standing back there
and quirky and--

868
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:51,700
[exaggerated laugh]

869
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
It was refreshing to me.

870
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,066
- Moving on to Roxxxy Andrews.

871
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,567
- Roxxxy sees herself
as not funny,

872
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,533
and I think she was too much
in her head,

873
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,133
trying to
think how she can deliver it.

874
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,667
- And she seemed to be
out of character.

875
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,967
- I'd agree.

876
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,300
Roxxxy was stumbling from one
transition to the next.

877
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,433
It wasn't her night.

878
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,066
- She was really, really,
really nervous.

879
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,066
And I think it was just
a meltdown,

880
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,700
and it's hard to watch that.

881
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
- All right.

882
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,834
- Ivy Winters.

883
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,667
- She read her cards
the whole time.

884
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,066
She didn't connect once.

885
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:21,233
I didn't see her eyes.

886
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,367
I got no emotion from her.

887
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,300
And that's been my problem
with Ivy.

888
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,800
She's like a cardboard cutout.

889
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,467
- I didn't have a problem with
Ivy in that way, Michelle.

890
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,333
She wasn't as rough as some of
the other girls

891
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,734
with segueing from one joke
to the next,

892
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:35,300
and there was some really funny
moments.

893
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,834
- Coco Montrese.

894
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,133
- Great concept,
great delivery.

895
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,500
Very good tonight for Coco.

896
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,333
Especially coming from where
she was last week.

897
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,400
- Coco came out here tonight
with a new attitude.

898
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
She had consistent joke
after joke.

899
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,633
- I almost fell off the chair.

900
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,066
The whole time she was up there,

901
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,767
she stayed in that character.

902
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,767
I died.

903
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,433
- Jinkx Monsoon.

904
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:56,233
- Hallelu.

905
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,734
She looked great.

906
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:59,900
I was so very proud of her.

907
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,066
- I would have loved her
to have played more

908
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,066
with the other queens.

909
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,767
Reading them a little more.
Yes.

910
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,734
- I have two words:
master comedienne.

911
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:09,900
- All right, next up, Detox.

912
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,333
- We all know she's funny.

913
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,900
She could have done more and got
rid of some of the f-bombs.

914
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,867
- You know, the f-bomb
usually means

915
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:17,734
that someone's very nervous.

916
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:18,900
- You can laugh, but it's like,

917
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,867
oh, and another f-bomb,
oh, and another f-bomb.

918
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,066
And it's no longer funny
or bombastic.

919
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,300
- I expected more from her.

920
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,800
- Alyssa Edwards.

921
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,834
- The dress was a disaster
tonight.

922
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,467
I got prom feeling from it.

923
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,633
And then the roast--

924
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,967
wah-wah.

925
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:34,967
Intimidation.

926
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,066
- Yeah, that was it.

927
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,266
- Was she intimidated
by the other girls?

928
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,467
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

929
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,533
- So many funny girls
up there tonight.

930
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,533
- They were--they were funny,

931
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,567
and I think she just--
she melted.

932
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,867
But I think she's beautiful.

933
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:46,967
- [laughs]

934
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:49,100
- She looks like
a fairy prince.

935
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,133
[all laugh]

936
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,467
- Silence.

937
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,233
I've made my decision.

938
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:56,600
Bring back...

939
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,066
my girls.

940
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,633
[laughs]

941
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,233
- [laughs]

942
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,200
Welcome back, ladies.

943
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,400
I've made some decisions.

944
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,467
Alaska, tonight you proved
you can stand on your own.

945
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:16,867
You're safe.

946
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:17,967
- Thank you.

947
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,967
[blows kiss]

948
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,900
- Jinkx Monsoon,

949
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,166
your look tonight was no joke.

950
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,834
Keep it up.

951
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,066
You're safe.

952
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,333
- Thank you.

953
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,166
- Coco Montrese.

954
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,433
As my hood rat cousin,

955
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,433
you tore me to shreds.

956
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,900
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

957
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,867
Condragulations.

958
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,066
[applause]

959
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:50,300
You've won a custom gown
from SequinQueen.

960
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,734
- Coco Montrese is back.

961
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:55,467
Yes, God, I'm back, baby.

962
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,834
- Detox...

963
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:00,834
you're safe.

964
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,533
Alyssa Edwards,

965
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:07,066
tonight your punch lines
flatlined.

966
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:12,834
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

967
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:18,800
Ivy Winters, you struggled
to connect with the audience.

968
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,367
Roxxxy Andrews, tonight was not
your shining moment.

969
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,533
Ivy Winters...

970
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,266
you're safe.

971
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,400
Roxxxy Andrews, I'm sorry,
my dear,

972
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,333
but you are up for elimination.

973
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,400
- All of this stress
has just hit me.

974
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,967
This is honestly the first time
in this competition

975
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,834
that I felt
"You're not good enough."

976
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,900
- Two queens stand before me.

977
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,867
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

978
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:54,367
and save yourself
from elimination.

979
00:37:54,367 --> 00:38:00,467
The time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.

980
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,467
- Get ready for the lip sync
of your life.

981
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,667
- Good luck.

982
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,767

00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:38,433
Sorry.

Go ahead.

- No, tell me about it.

1037
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,266
- It just hit me and...

1038
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:52,633
like not feeling wanted

1039
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:55,734
and not being good enough.

1040
00:39:55,734 --> 00:40:01,567
I just feel like my mom
never wanted me and--

1041
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,400
my mother left my sister
and myself at a bus stop

1042
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,333
when I was three.

1043
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,033
And I remember it like it was
yesterday.

1044
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,100
And, like, I come off
as this strong character.

1045
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,767
I try to stay so strong,

1046
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,333
but I'm so weak,
and I'm so tired.

1050
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,734

1051
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,100
And you are so welcome here.

1052
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,367
You know, we as gay people,

1053
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,734
we get to choose our family.

1054
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:48,066
You know, we get to choose
the people that we're around.

1055
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,800
You know what I'm saying?

1056
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,767
I am your family.

1057
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:56,834
We are a family here.

1058
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,800
I love you.

1059
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,333

1060
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,533

1061
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,700
I've made my decision.

1062
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,734
What you two did on this runway

1063
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:22,500
is the passion
I am looking for.

1064
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,934
Shantay, you both stay.

1065
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:28,300
- [cries]

1066
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,066
- [cries]

1067
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,100
- Thank you so much.

1068
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:39,767
- These are no longer just drag
queens I am competing with.

1069
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,066
I'm growing attached
to these people.

1070
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,700
We are like the seven sisters
right now.

1071
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,834
- My seven sister queens.

1072
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,500
If you can't love yourself,

1073
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,166
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

1074
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,367
Can I get a amen in here?

1075
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:56,200
all: Amen!

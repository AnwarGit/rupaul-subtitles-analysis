Thank you, thank you.
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>Reunited.</i>
- I love you, Ru!
- I love you.
I'll meet you after the show.
Let's get some money, though.
[cheers and applause]
Now, I am beyond excited
that all my girls are back
to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
[giggling]
But the thing that makes
tonight
and every night
so extra special
is you,
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Honey, you have turned
Monday night into par-tay night!
That's right.
It's true.
I know that you all get
together, get your drink on,
scream shit at the TV screen.
I know what you do.
So whether you're watching
in a bar or at a house party
or kiki-ing with
#friendsonline...
[audience laughs]
I want everyone
within the sound of my voice
to scream,
"I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!"
Come on, say it with me.
all: I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!
- Again.
all: I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!
- All right!
[cheers and applause]
So keep your freak flag
flying high.
And from the bottom
of my heart,
thank you for making this season
the biggest
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> herstory.</i>
It's true.
You know...
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
isn't about who gets eliminated,
it's about who keeps
coming back.
And tonight, so many
of our queens have returned.
Give it up for
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royal box.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hey, pork chop!
Hey, pork chop!
[laughing]
Now, are you ready for some
reunion realness?
[cheers and applause]
'Cause I have one thing to say.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...win!
[cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause]
These first three queens
were only here
a few short weeks,
but they made a big splash.
Take a look.
- Hello, boys.
<i>My name is Penny Tration.</i>
<i>I was chosen</i>
in the online voting contest.
- Deeper, Penny Tration.
Girl, you're gonna put
Shelley Winters out of work.
- [laughing]
-<i> My name is Serena ChaCha,</i>
<i>and I'm interested in</i>
fine art drag.
There is, um, a new art movement
called soft sculpture.
It's more about creating
a sculpture
rather than just tailoring.
- Hello, girls.
<i>I'm Monica Beverly Hillz.</i>
<i>I have been called</i>
<i>ghetto,</i>
banjee, trashy.
<i>I was raised in the ghetto.</i>
<i>You know, I'm street smart,</i>
and there's nothing wrong
with that.
-<i> That is a nice ass.</i>
-<i> And it's not padded.</i>
-<i> Monica is slaying the hell</i>
<i>out of Serena,</i>
<i>and I'm very happy.</i>
- We all love you.
- We love you.
[cheers and applause]
- Welcome, ladies.
Welcome.
First up, Penny Tration.
Now, Penny, was it hard to, uh,
go home first?
- It was great.
I got to get away
from these bitches.
- Oh, okay. All right.
So now, which of the challenges
would you have rocked?
- Oh, I think
the reading challenge
was pretty much my forte.
- Oh, well, today's
your lucky day, darling,
because the library is open!
- Let's start with
a hometown favorite,
the lovely Detox.
Detox, when you walk down
the runway,
I do expect for the credits
to start running
for<i> Gorillas in the Mist.</i>
[laughter]
And to my dear, dear Serena,
I would read you,
but it does appear
life already has.
[audience "ohs"]
- All right.
Okay, well, now, the library
is closed...officially.
Next up, Serena ChaCha.
Now, your art school background
seemed to rub people
the wrong way.
So what would you have done
differently?
- I would've shut my ass up
and worn a sequin dress
and asked to borrow
one of Coco's pair of earrings
and walked down that runway
full of glam.
- Okay, well, which challenge
would you have rocked?
- As a fan of telenovelas,
Luis Fernando Sylvester
Montalban...
[speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
-<i> Escandalo!</i>
Ugh!
Now, a lot of big revelations
happened
on the main stage,
but one of the most moving
came from Monica Beverly Hillz.
It raised a lot of questions
about what is drag
and what is trans.
When we come back,
I'm gonna ask Monica
for some answers.
Don't go away.
-<i> Coming up,</i>
<i>the queens answer</i>
<i>viewer questions.</i>
<i>So let's get this mother</i>
<i>trending.</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska?</i>
<i>Team Jinkx?</i>
<i>Or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Let your voice be heard</i>
<i>as we prepare to crown</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
We are just moments away
from finding out which queen
will be crowned America's
next drag superstar,
but first, let's talk
to another fierce queen,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Hi, mama.
- Now, Monica, you came
on to the show with passion,
poise, and a secret.
Let's take a look.
Monica, tell me
what's on your mind.
- It's true what you're saying.
There is a lot going
through my head.
I feel I'm not here.
I've just
been holding a secret in,
and I've been trying so hard,
and--
- What secret?
- I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
[cheers and applause]
- Monica...
You know, there's a lot of
confusion out there,
so help everybody out.
Okay, now, can a girl
be a drag queen
and a trans woman
at the same time?
- Yes.
Drag is what I do.
Trans is who I am.
- All right. All right.
Yeah.
And you know, for the record,
everybody out there,
the only requirement
for being here is the desire
to be America's
next drag superstar,
and the only thing we screen for
is charisma, uniqueness,
nerve,
and talent.
[cheers and applause]
Now, uh, how have things been
since the show?
- It's been really great.
I actually got approached
by a cosmetic line.
I'm a face model now, so--
- What?
- I'm good at giving face, baby.
It's my moneymaker.
- Next up, a sexy Puerto Rican
and a bicoastal twosome
that made me do something
I thought I'd never do:
a double elimination.
Oh, shoot!
[laughs]
Take a look.
Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,
neither one of you showed me
the fire it takes to stay.
I'm sending you both home.
Ladies, welcome.
Now, Vivienne, you've been
called
the fishiest queen ever.
Now, do you think
being fishy is enough?
- Well, for me it is.
[laughter]
Now, was it enough
for this season?
Obviously not.
If it were America's
next drag supermodel,
I would definitely be
in the top three.
- All right, all right.
Now...
Girl, I heard a rumor
that you work
for Alyssa Edwards now.
Is that true?
- [laughs]
Well, she likes to think so.
But I haven't received
my first paycheck, so...
- Oh, bitch.
- I don't know.
[audience "ohs"]
[laughing]
But what I have been doing,
I've been doing
makeup tutorials online.
- Oh, okay.
Do you think
I'd look good in makeup?
[audience laughing]
No, I'm serious.
I mean, I wanna try it.
- Well, girl...
[cheers and applause]
Girl, I like you
how you are right now
in your natural state.
- Uh-huh.
- But if you do wanna try it,
I would start off
with a tinted moisturizer.
- Okay, okay.
That's good advice.
Up next, Honey Mahogany.
Yes, mama.
Now, Honey, your style
was criticized
for being a little too
Bed, Bath, and Beyonce,
you know?
Now, what do you have to say
for yourself?
- Well, I found myself
a fab new style team
in San Francisco, where the look
does matter.
[audience cheers, laughs]
And, um, I have a little
something I'd like to show you.
- Oh.
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh!
[cheers and applause]
- All right.
- [mouthing words]
- Wow.
- Do you want me
to turn around?
Should I turn around?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- All right.
TrimSpa, baby.
[laughter]
Now, Honey, as our first
San Francisco queen,
can you describe
the San Francisco style?
- You know, it's hard to
describe the San Francisco style
because there are so many
different types of drag
in San Francisco.
We have fairies,
we have bearded ladies,
we have glamour queens,
pageant girls,
the Ducal Court--
we've got it all.
- Oh, all right.
I love it!
Now, Honey, San Francisco
is so proud of you
and so am I.
Keep representing, girl.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Up next, Lineysha Sparx.
Now--
[cheers and applause]
So, now, Lineysha,
Charo couldn't make it tonight
to translate, so why don't you
address the audience
in Spanish?
It might be easier
in your native tongue.
- Of course.
[speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.
Really, I couldn't have.
Lineysha, you know I love you,
but this season,
you committed a sin
that is unforgivable.
- Yeah?
- Take a look.
Who is playing Diana Ross?
- That would be
Miss Lineysha here.
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?
- Um, not really, no.
[glass shattering]
- Okay.
- [laughing]
- Okay.
Lineysha, do you know
who Diana Ross is now?
- Well, right now, yes.
I love--she's banana dance.
That is not--
- That's Josephine Baker, baby.
- Ah, sorry.
Um, no, but it's just kidding.
It's just kidding.
- Okay, so name
a Diana Ross song.
- Diana Ross song?
I know that she move like this.
And she's--
That was--I was practicing.
- Um, immigration?
- Ru! How rude!
[laughter and applause]
- Immigration?
- [giggling]
- Well, you're not alone,
because I know there are
a lot of young'uns out there
that could use a course
in gay miracles.
Pay attention, because there
will be a pop quiz.
Time for your Drag Race
herstory minute.
The reading rainbow
begins with
the one and only Judy Garland.
You know, she played that girl
in the stoner film
about the ruby-red pumps.
The glamorous '40s gave us
broads like Bette Davis,
Joan Crawford,
and Lena Horne.
The '50s dropped
atomic blonde bombshells--
Marilyn Monroe, Doris Day,
and Etta James.
That's right, a sister can have
blonde hair too.
The swinging '60s gave us
the super-duper Supremes,
"Tinta" Turner,
and Barbra Streisand.
Well, hello, gorgeous!
The "me" decade of the 1970s
saw Diana go solo,
Dolly split with Porter,
and Farrah told
<i>Charlie's Angels</i>
to kiss her T&amp;A good-bye.
The '80s were a holiday,
as the rhythm nation showed
its true colors with Madonna,
Janet, and Cyndi.
Oh, and Faye Dunaway
stole my heart
with just three little words:
"No wire hangers!"
The '90s were dominated
by Mimi,
Whitney, Britney, and X-Tina
and a little girl group
goin' by the name
of Destiny's Child.
Which brings us to today's
reigning divas:
Gaga, Beyonce, Katy, and Nicki.
And if you didn't learn
anything else,
just remember one thing:
Cher, Cher, Cher, Cher, stupid.
And that's today's
drag herstory minute.
[laughs]
And, honey, that's just the tip
of the iceberg.
So please tweet me
your favorite divas @RuPaul.
It takes a village, people!
-<i> Coming up...</i>
<i>The final face-off between</i>
<i>fierce rivals</i>
<i>Coco Montrese</i>
<i>and Alyssa Edwards.</i>

<i>Find out when</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's</i>
Drag Race Reunited<i> continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
Now, these next two queens
represented
the ultimate contrast
in styles.
One was quiet, ladylike,
and demure,
and the other was, well,
Jade Jolie.
Take a look.
-<i> I'm the sweetest bitch</i>
<i>you'll meet,</i>
<i>but if you come for me,</i>
then you'll see
a whole new side.
Girl, you ain't that pretty.
- Oh.
- Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.
You're a dirty bitch.
- I don't understand
why you're trying
to like come for me.
- You had rolls
all over the place in the back.
It was disgusting.
- Back rolls?
-<i> My name is Ivy Winters.</i>
- Are those your pictures
on there?
- They're all my face.
I will figure out a way
to turn it into a costume.
- You make everything
that you wear?
- I do.
- You're mind-blowingly
talented.
- This week's winner is...
Ivy! Ivy!
[echoing]
Ivy Winters!
- Hi, mama.
- [laughs]
Miss Jolie.
You know,
when you first arrived,
everybody thought you were
gonna be the sweet one.
But you turned into
a Sour Patch Kid.
What was going on?
- Me too.
I swear I was America's
sweetheart until I watched it.
I was like,
that's a cunt, honey.
[laughter]
But it was rainbowy
and gorgeous, so it was okay.
- Now, I wanna ask you,
do you regret accusing
Alyssa Edwards of having...
back rolls?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Back rolls?
- [laughs]
I consider Alyssa
one of my very good friends,
and I think she's fabulous
and fierce.
- All right.
Up next, Ivyyyyy Winters!
Now, Ivy, you showcased
one breathtaking outfit
after another.
Now, do you think
the other queens were jealous?
- No, I sew
for a lot of drag queens,
so if you're jealous, you can
always call me.
- Oh, okay. All right.
Well, it pays to advertise.
[laughter]
Do you have any regrets?
- Yes, I would have to say
my Marilyn.
- Oh, is that who you were
playing?
- That's what I was--
[laughs]
- What was it like
to see yourself
as Norma Jean, Miss Thang?
- That was, like, the first time
I've ever tried
impersonating someone.
- Yeah.
- I wish I would've went
with my second choice.
- So what would you have done
if you hadn't done Marilyn?
- I would've done Julia Child.
- Really?
- [as Julia Child]
<i>Bonjour!</i>
Welcome to my kitchen.
My name is Marilyn Monroe.
[cheers and applause]
- Keep that sewing machine
humming away, girl.
Now, Ivy, I've gotta confess.
I wanna tell you why I say,
"Ivyyyyy Winters!"
- Thank God.
- Yes.
Now, to help me with this
explanation,
please welcome the star
of<i> Life With La Toya,</i>
La Toya Jackson.
[cheers and applause]
♪ ♪
- Hi!
- Thank you very much.
- Now, La Toya, you have been
a guest judge
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
more than any other person.
- [giggles]
- Why do you keep coming back?
- Because I love the show, Ru,
and I love you.
- Aw, thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
- That's very sweet.
Now, La Toya, in 1989,
you did a pay-per-view concert
called<i> A Sizzling Spectacular.</i>
Do you remember that?
- Sort of, yeah.
- Well, I gotta tell ya.
I became so obsessed
with the way
you introduced
musician Edgar Winters.
Would you introduce him
for me now?
- Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Edgar Winters!
- Yeah, okay.
Well, but I gotta tell ya,
it was more like,
"Ivyyyyy Winterrrrs!"
- Edgarrrrrr Winters!
- I want everybody
in the audience to say it.
all: Ivyyyyy Winters.
- Okay, now, La Toya,
you say Edgar Winters.
- Okay.

- Ivyyyyy Winters!
- No! Edgarrrrr Winters,
you guys!
- [cackling]
- It is.
I don't know.

Oh, wow!
Now, all drag queens
throw shade,
but this season,
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards
were heavyweight champions.
Let's take a look.
- Oh, boys!
- And then walks in
Coco Montrese.
- Oh, my God!
Alyssa Edwards.
-<i> We haven't spoke</i>
<i>in two years.</i>
- It was pure hell!
- And the Academy Award
goes to--
- Fuck you, Alyssa.
- And look how orange
you fucking look, girl.
- Now, Miss Alyssa...
- Whoo-whoo!
- Now, you pushed it.
- I'm joking with you.
- I'm not joking, bitch!
- Ladyboys and gentlemen,
it's the rematch of the century!
The Rumble
in the Lipstick Jungle!
Welcome to the center ring
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards!
[cheers and applause]
- Oh!
both: Mwah. Mwah.
- Ladies, welcome.
- Hello, hello.
- Now, I think I speak
on behalf
of all the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
everywhere when I say,
"Girl, your feud was endless,
honey."
And confusing!
It was so confusing,
am I right?
But I think I finally
figured it out.
So I'm gonna try
and explain it to everyone
just like my play cousin
Cornisha would, okay?
All right.
Alyssa was crowned
Miss Thing USA,
but after she came up,
she wasn't holding it down
no mo'.
- [scoffs]
- So and since Coco
was still thirsty,
she damn well
cold-snatched the crown.
So Alyssa thought Coco
was frontin',
just 'cause she was grinding up
as first runner-up,
you know what I'm saying?
So basically, y'all mad
'cause y'all friends.
Am I right, ladies?
- [laughs]
- Yeah!
- That's what I thought.
- That's it.
- That's what I thought.
- I will say that coming
into it and seeing Coco,
I really wasn't bothered so much
about the pageant drama...
More or less how we were going
to be interacting
with each other.
- Yes. Okay.
So, Coco, what was it like
hearing the other queens say
that your makeup was busted?
- I mean, watching myself
back on TV,
I was like, "Ooh!
You do look like a Dorito."
[laughter]
But I think I got it now,
I think.
[cheers and applause]
- It looks good.
Well, Coco and Alyssa,
your lip-sync battle
was epic,
and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.
Watch this.
-<i> Hi, Alyssa. Hi, Coco.</i>
<i>It was so exciting for me</i>
<i>to see you two ladies</i>
<i>lip-sync to my song</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Cold Hearted Snake
<i>during this year's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

<i>America loves you,</i>

- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
I'm here
with best frenemies
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards.
Now, Alyssa, your father
sent a message
and it really did bring
everyone to tears, you know?
Let's take a look at that.
- Oh, gosh.
- Somebody's dad
is on the phone.
- I know it's not mine.
My dad wouldn't even know
how to use the Skype.
[chuckles]
-<i> Hey, Alyssa, this is Dad.</i>
- Alyssa...
- [gasps]
-<i> I just wanted you to know...</i>
<i>[voice breaks]</i>
<i>That I'm proud of you.</i>
<i>And now I'm not ashamed</i>
<i>to tell people</i>
<i>that my son's gay.</i>
- Oh, oh, my God.
[crying]
- Wow, wow.
- Ooh.
[applause]
- So, Alyssa...
what's happened with your dad
since the show aired?
- For the very first time
in my life,
I'm starting to feel
forgiveness.
It's the most powerful feeling
one could ever feel,
and we are working on developing
a relationship.
My father is a grandfather,
and everything
that he couldn't do
for me or my siblings,
he's making up for with my niece
and nephews.
- I love it. I love it.
[cheers and applause]
That's right.
You know,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race--</i>
still bringing families
together.
[laughter]
It's true.
Now, Alyssa,
Santino accused you
of wearing the worst dress
in five seasons.
But sometimes, the memory can
play tricks on us.
Take a look.
There's corn hanging
from her hand!
[laughter]
- It's not just an outfit,
it's a lifestyle.
[all screaming]
[laughter]
[buzzer]
- She's a little frosty.
- I see a lot of armpit.
Like, armpit!
- But it's fresh.
[laughter]
- ChaCha.
- She has to start thinking
about the way she's gonna
execute her fashions.
- Well, she executed this
fashion.
[laughter]
- Yes, honey,
this is a two-page spread.
- Ugh, it looks like a couch
from Rent-a-Center.
- Oh, Lord.
- Well, right now,
you're a mess.
Things are falling off.
No one can accuse you
of not having
a great pair of legs.
- [laughs]
- First of all.
[laughter and applause]
- No T, no shade, ladies.
Now, Santino.
- Yes?
- Do you still think Alyssa's
dress is the worst
in five seasons?
- I do.
[laughter]
And this is why, okay?
- Can we take a vote?
Can we take a vote?
- This is why.
Every season, Ru asks the queens
to make a dress
and do it
in four to six hours.
Alyssa, you brought that dress
with you.
[laughter]
You brought that dress
with you.
That dress, it doesn't look
as bad on TV
as it did in person, but--
[audience "ohs"]
But I tweeted to you,
I said,
"You know, the thing I hope
for Alyssa
"is that she can tour the world
"so that everyone can see
the worst dress
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history."</i>
[laughter and applause]
- You know, I'm sensing
a lot of sexual tension
between you two.
I mean, you guys,
I think y'all need to hook up,
and make this shit happen.
Y'all need to go and fuck,
you know what I'm saying?
[laughter and applause]
You two. You two.
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah!
- That's--that's what needs
to happen.
- Yeah.
- That's exactly
what needs to happen.
- Now, our next queen
was one of the best ever
in the history of<i> Drag Race.</i>
Don't believe me?
Just ask her.
Take a look.
- Wow.
[cheers and applause]
My name is Detox,
and I am 27 years old.
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?
- [laughs]
-<i> My tits are bouncing</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>
<i>I have a great body,</i>
<i>so why not show it off?</i>
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>I haven't had done</i>
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.
<i>And I'm the queen bee,</i>
<i>so eat it up</i>
and crown it.
[cheers and applause]
- Detox, welcome!
Welcome, Detox.
All right, first question.
Why it gotta be gray?
- [laughs]
Um, well, it was a gray day
in Los Angeles
when I got kicked off, so--
- Oh, okay.
- Was it not?
- Yeah.
Now, Detox, coming into
this competition,
you were one fierce
and funny queen.
- I was?
- Yes, and now that
the competition's over,
girl, you still are.
How you feelin'?
- I'm feeling amazing.
It's been, like, the most
magical experience
I've ever had.
It's been a complete blast,
and the fact that I'm able
to tour the world
with some of my best girlfriends
and do something
that I love and art of drag
that I love so much
is just beyond amazing to me,
and I'm so happy and thrilled.
- I love your collaborations
with Willam and Vicky Vox.
Now, I heard that you were all
recently performing in Dubai.
- Yeah.
Li-li-li-li-li-li-li!
- Did you have to wear a burka?
- No, we wanted to wear burkas,
but then we just said
fuck it,
and we're sluts.
I mean, hello, look at Willam.
That's his aesthetic.
- Now, you were also outspoken
in your criticism
of some of the younger queens.
Do you still feel that they
treated the show as...
[old woman voice]
Rupaul's School for Girls?
- There were certain girls--
like, some of the larger names
and the people that have been
in the industry
for a long time
that would be torn apart
for doing
what they do the best,
whereas some of the judges
were treating them
as, you know, students.
Yes, you.
- Are you talking to Santino?
- I'm talking to both of 'em,
Santino and Michelle.
- Oh.
[laughs]
- I don't give--y'all know
I don't give two shits.
[laughter and cheering]
- Now, just between us girls...
- Mm-hmm.
- As a member of Rolaskatox...
- Mm-hmm.
- Who should be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
- Detox.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
But--yeah, you're not eligible.
Oh, whatever.
- [laughs]
- Thanks for sharing, Detox.
Now, before I go any further,
I'd like to take this moment
to say something
I've actually never said
on national television before.
Can you bring the camera closer?
[laughter]
Closer.
Now, back the fuck up.
Not that close.
[sighs]
Okay, this is hard for me.
Due to the fact that her thighs
spread just like...
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut, peanut... ♪</i>
<i>♪ P-p-peanut, peanut,</i>
<i>peanut... ♪</i>
<i>♪ Peanut butter... ♪</i>
<i>♪ P-p-p-peanut butter... ♪</i>

Don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back
with the final three, hunty.
-<i> Coming up, we'll announce</i>
<i>the viewer's choice</i>
<i>for Miss Congeniality.</i>
<i>Who should be America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar?</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska,</i>
<i>team Jinkx, or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Let's keep things trending</i>
<i>as</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited</i>
<i>keeps on keepin' on.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
And now, the reason
we're all here tonight.
Please welcome back
to the stages the final three.
Alaska.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Welcome, ladies.
You look sickening.
Now, I have so much
I have to ask you,
but first, we're gonna
take some questions
from the fans.
Inquiring minds want to know.
This first one here
is for Jinkx.
The Duchess of Dork
wants to know
about your crush on Ivyyyy.
"Did you guys ever hook up
after the show?"
- Well, when you're held
in captivity
in a little pink hamster cage,
eventually, you just look
for the cutest person
in the room,
and I chose Ivy Winters.
[laughter]
- You know, Ivy,
was there a love connection?
- I was actually shocked
when I was watching
the episode with my boyfriend...
- Me too.
- And he was like, "Oh."
- I didn't know
they were gonna air that.
[laughter]
But nothing ever came of it,
and we're actually
just very good friends,
you know,
and I've met her boyfriend,
he's very charming.
- I mean, honestly, wha--
I mean, really,
what's the problem?
I mean, triads
are really in right now.
- [laughs]
- And honestly,
I could see a spin-off show
like, you know,
<i>Drag Sister Wives</i>
or something like that.
All right, this next question
is for Alaska.
Oscar asks, "Do you think
being part of Rolaskatox
helped or hurt you?"
- I knew Detox
from a long time ago,
and she knew Roxxxy
from a long time ago,
so we were just, like,
friends,
and we needed a prescription
drug for gagging,
so we called it Rolaskatox.
- [laughs]
- I don't think it really
hurt me,
but Michelle hated it.
And she called us "Rolodex."
I don't even know
what a Rolodex is!
[laughter and applause]
- Now, Roxxxy, what about you?
Do you think it helped
or hurt you?
- To me, it was never,
you know,
"Well, I'm gonna be
on<i> Survivor</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now,"</i>
and be like,
"This is my alliance,
"and we're gonna stick together
and get everybody out of here."
It was never that,
so when she said
she wanted to go off
on her own,
we were like, "Girl,
we love you no matter what."
Like, "Go on and do your thing
if that's what you feel
you need to do."
- Jinkx, you were not
in Rolaskatox.
What are your thoughts?
Did you feel alienated by it?
- Well, you know, cliques
can either help or hinder you.
They can be a big distraction,
but even though they had
a clique, I had a mantra.
[laughter]
- Which was?
- Let's say it together,
ladies and gentlemen.
all: Water off a duck's back.
[laughter]
- Now, this next question
is for Roxxxy.
Gwen asks,
"Do you honestly feel
"that comedy drag
is insulting,
or was that you just playing
mind games?"
- You know, I take drag very,
very seriously,
and sometimes--
I noticed on the show--
too seriously.
And no, it's not insulting
at all whatsoever,
and you know,
they're my complete opposites,
and that's what
makes them magic,
and I can learn a lot
from them.
- All right.
Now, this next question
is from Johnny B.
This is for Alyssa.
"Have you figured out
what Alyssa's secret is yet?"
[laughter and cheers]
- Well, Johnny, if I told you,
it wouldn't be a secret.
- So is--that's a "No,
you don't know what it is"?
[laughter]
- It's 9 inches
and fully functional.
- Oh, my God!
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Not so secret anymore,
is it?
Now, this next question
is to all the queens.
Ian asks, "What motivated you
to do the show,
the title or the $100,000?"
Let's start here with Alaska.
- Um, what motivated me
was the fact
that I auditioned
for every single season
and never made it,
so it eventually became
a personal vendetta
to get on the program.
[laughter and cheers]
- And what about you?
- Honestly, since I was
five years old,
this is what I wanted to do.
You know--
- This show was on
when you were five years old?
- No, I used to say--
I used to watch
<i>Death Becomes Her,</i>
and I knew I wanted to grow up
to be Meryl Streep.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, Roxxxy,
title or moola?
- Definitely the title
and the competition.
I'm a pageant girl.
I like to compete,
and that was the platform
to show the world
that I could be
America's next drag superstar
and compete with
the best of the best,
which,
I think this season is the best
of the best.
Nothing against the other ones.
[laughter and jeering]
- Now, you know, every year,
we ask our fans to vote
for Miss Congeniality,
and this year,
the choice was tougher
than ever.
Now, to help me bestow
this honor, please welcome
last year's Miss Congeniality,
Latrice Royale.
[cheers and applause]
Hey, mommy.
- Hey!
- Looking good.
- And feeling gorgeous, baby.
- Hey.
Now, Latrice, would you please
do us the honors?
- This year's Miss Congeniality
is...
[suspenseful music]
Ivyyyyy Winters!
- Condragulations, Ivy.
You have won a six-night stay
plus airfare
for you and a guest
from Hilton Hotels and Resorts.
Now, you can stay Hilton.
Go out at one of their
550 locations in 80 countries.
- Oh, my gosh.
Oh, thank you guys so much.
Thank you so much.
I feel like I just won!
Thank you, mwah.
- All right, Ivy.
Now, sissy that walk.
Sissy that walk.
[cheers and applause]
- I love you.
-<i> Who will be crowned</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar?</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska,</i>
<i>team Jinkx,</i>
<i>or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Keep tweeting,</i>
<i>and find out when</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited
<i>continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
Now, I'm here with
our final three: Alaska...
[cheers and applause]
Jinkx Monsoon...
[cheers and applause]
And Roxxxy Andrews!
[cheers and applause]
Now, in less time
than it takes
to microwave
a chicken pot pie,
one of them will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Not only did these three queens
snatch our hearts, but they
tickled our funny bones.
Take a look.
Direct from<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it's little Edie Beale.
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.
- How is big Edie doing?
- She's always begging
for the pate,
but the label is faded.
I can never tell if it's pate
or if it's giblets for the cats.
[laughter]
- My old, old friend,
Lady Bunny.
- You know, the last time
I had a battle of the browns
was about ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.
[laughter]
- Tamar Braxton!
- Get your life.
- Paula Deen is out of control.
This morning, she put a stick
of butter--
- On her--boom!
Louboutins,
'cause her fat-ass feet
don't fit in 'em.
[laughter]
Boom, boom, baby.
Rock, rock.
- [laughs]
Now, Alaska, were you nervous
to play a character like
Lady Bunny, who's you know,
already very funny?
- I was really nervous,
'cause she's so old.
[laughter]
- [gasping laugh]
- And I was gonna do
Michelle Obama,
but that was already taken,
so...
[laughter]
- Oh!
- Now, when Coco
and some of the other queens
hadn't heard
of<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it caused quite the controversy
online.
- Quite the scandal, really.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Now, Jinkx, were you surprised
by that?
- Uh--I was surprised by
America's reaction.
I didn't know that many people
knew about her,
but I was thrilled to see it,
you know?
- All right.
Roxxxy, now, you say you're not
a comedy queen,
but your Tamar Braxton
slayed the children
dot com, girl.
- Dot com.
- Yes.
- I wanted to do somebody
that I knew
could be funny off the bat.
Her personality
is so off-the-wall
that if you didn't know her,
you wanted to laugh at her,
so that's why
I went with Tamar.
I love you, Tamar.
- Well, they say imitation
is the sincerest form
of flattery,
but sometimes, it could really
piss people off.
Let's take a look.
<i>The final three are so bitchy,</i>
<i>they don't just throw shade,</i>
<i>they "blank" it.</i>
- Well, I don't know them
personally,
so I said they airmail it,
though that's frightfully
expensive.
Hi, Jinkx, it's me, Bebe Wood
from<i> The New Normal.</i>
You do the second-best
impression of little Edie.
- [laughs]
- I just know Ru's
going to make
the staunch decision.
- [squeals]
- Good luck,
and don't funk it up.
- [screaming laugh]
-<i> Lady Bunny, same question.</i>
- They throw it so hard
that it casts
more of a shadow than
Alyssa Edwards' overbite
on her nonexistent chin.
[laughter]
Alaska, I wanted to tell you
that your impersonation of me
was spot on.
And I'm gonna get you for that.
[laughter]
-<i> All right, Tamar Braxton!</i>
- They do that on over-the-top
shade dot com, okay?
Boom!
Get your life.
[laughter]
Where my Roxxxy at?
She is my queen dot com,
and I know she fixin' to do me
proud, okay?
Boom! Yes!
- Boom!
[laughter]
- I love it!
I love it.
Condragulations, ladies,
you're a hit.
Now, ladies, it's time to get
serious.
Assume the position, because I'm
about to do one final
examination of your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
I hope you showered.
First up, Alaska.
Hi-ee.
- Hi-ee.
- Hi-ee!
- Hi-ee!
[laughter]
- Now, your wicked wit
and junkyard couture
have served you well
in your journey from tragic
to magic.
Let's take a look.
- Hi-ee.
Hi-ee. Hi-ee!
<i>My name is Alaska.</i>
- You're finally here.
- I know, yay.
- A tired, second-rate version
of your husband.
- Ohh!
[both grunt]
- Isn't Sharon the superstar
of the relationship?
- I had to choose,
am I gonna
be bitter
or become her biggest fan?
<i>♪ Can I get a... ♪</i>
[singing over each other]
- Whoa, stop there.
- Don't worry about your group,
whoever you're with.
Worry about you.
Something's missing, Alaska.
Bring it.
-<i> Dangerous.</i>
<i>Flawless.</i>
<i>Overpriced.</i>
- You're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ah!
- You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Ah!
I am the queen
who takes the tragic
and turns it into magic.
I take trash and turn it into
treasure,
and having never fallen
into the bottom two,
I am Alaska,
and I am America's next
drag superstar!
[echoing]
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- I love it.
Now, Alaska,
what has<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meant to you?</i>
- It's just, like--like, I
can't even believe
I'm sitting
in this spot right now,
and all these
fucking people are here.
Hi-ee!
all: Hi-ee!
- Now, Alaska, you're part
of a drag super couple.
Now, is that a blessing
or a curse?
- I think it's an awesome
blessing,
because I couldn't choose
a better person who is--
who could be so supportive
and who's always there for me
and always believes in me,
even when I don't believe
in myself.
And I get to wear
all of her designer clothes.
[laughter]
- So, Sharon, what's it like
watching Alaska up here?
- It's--it's embarrassing.
Um, no, I'm--I'm--it--
[laughter]
I'm--I'm kidding.
When you look
at Alaska Thunderfuck--
when I look at you right now,
you have the tangible,
marketable beauty
of Roxxxy Andrews
and the campy theatrics
of Jinkx Monsoon,
and in my heart,
you are America's
next drag superstar,
and you and me
will be the most famous people
in reality television
from Pittsburgh, next to
Abby Lee Miller, of course.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Pam, did you know that Alaska
would grow up to be
a world-famous drag queen?
- Never in a million years
would I have ever dreamt
that he would've grown up
to be a famous drag queen.
I-I have four children,
I'm proud of all of them,
and I wanted them all
to be happy.
I have an Air Force man,
an Army man,
a medical daughter,
and now--
- And this.
- I'm well--no!
I'm so--I'm so well-rounded
with you.
I love you.
I'm so, so proud.
- Now, Alaska, what would it
mean to you
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- [stammering]
[laughter]
I mean, it would change my life.
And just being here and doing
this experience has already
changed my life, and that would
just be so amazing.
And with the money, I would buy
100,000 slices of pizza
and share it with all of you.
- Oh, yummy.
- Aww.
- I love pizza.
- Me too.
- Alaska, it's been a real joy
to watch you blossom,
and you walk
in no one's shadow.
You are a force to be reckoned
with, because Alaska
is a thunder-fucking star,
y'all!
[cheers and applause]
-<i> Coming up, Jinkx and Roxxxy</i>
<i>spill the T when</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited
<i>continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
In a moment,
we'll be crowning
America's next drag superstar,
but first,
I've drilled Alaska.
Now, it's time for me to probe
Jinkx Monsoon.
Take a look.
-<i> My name is Jinkx Monsoon.</i>
I am Seattle's premier Jewish
narcoleptic drag queen.
- What's on your head?
- Just a little headpiece.
- It's rather pedestrian.
Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.
[sighs]
I love it!
- [laughs]
I left my youngest brother
with a woman
who wasn't ready to be a mom.
To say that
"You're just a comedy queen"
is belittling something
I have made my whole career on.
- Jinkx, I have--
- I am talking.
- Oh.
-<i> I am in it to win it.</i>
<i>To dismiss me</i>
<i>would be a bad move.</i>
You should be taking me
as a threat.
[snores]
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
[laughs]
So, Jinkxy, how are you feeling
at this very moment?
You're not sleepy at all,
are ya?
- I-I-I could use a nap, but--
[laughter]
I feel like a more fully
realized drag queen.
I feel like a more fully
realized human being.
I remember hearing you say
you've been through many phases
in your drag,
and I think I've entered
Jinkx 2.0,
the butterfly phase.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- So tell me, what has been
your proudest moment
on the show?
- Honestly, working with Dave,
my veteran.
[cheers and applause]
Right there.
- You've been very open about
some childhood issues
you had with your mother
and your brother.
How are things now?
- You know, things are
wonderful.
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> kind of brought</i>
our family back together again,
and it caused us to have
some really
adult conversations.
- Are they here?
Are they here tonight?
- He's right over there.
- Oh.
- They're both there.
- So, Deanne, what was it like
having your Jinkxy discuss
family issues on television?
- Well, it hurt, mainly because
I saw how much
I hurt my child,
but at the same time,
it was good,
because it--it made--
it helped us to become
even closer.
- All right, yeah,
let the healing begin.
[applause]
Jacob, what's it like having
a drag queen for a brother?
- [chuckles]
Well, I never
really thought of him
as a drag queen.
I've just always thought of him
as my big brother,
and I know he's worked
so hard,
and I'm so proud of him
for being here.
And don't forget,
it's Monsoon season.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
So, Jinkx, what would it mean
to you
to become America's next
drag superstar?
- I would love to be given
the chance
to use this as a platform
to be an advocate
for social change.
I'm lucky enough to live in
Washington
where gay marriage
is legal, and...
[cheers and applause]
I don't want to rest until
that's the truth
for all of America.
[laughs]
- Well, Jinkx, you have
continued to surprise
and delight your fans.
Best of all, I think you've even
surprised yourself.
I'm so proud to have you
sitting here tonight.
Now, our next queen is a blast
from drag's proud pageant
past
and an important part
of its future.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Let's take a look.
-<i> My name is Roxxxy Andrews.</i>
- Condragulations.
- Oh!
- You are the winner
of this challenge.
-<i> ♪ Put on</i>
<i>a shiny sequence gown ♪</i>
[record scratch]
- Are you saying "sequin" or--
- Sequence dress.
- "Sequin dress" I think
is what you mean.
- Sequence.
- What do you call it
when you flat-line?
- You're dead.
- I come off as a strong
character,
but I'm so weak
at the same time!
[sobs]
- Bam!
- Oh.
- Condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- You look stunning.
- Thank you so much.
<i>I think it's time to crown</i>
a thick and juicy kind of girl.
- You're an amazing queen.
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Roxxxy, Roxxxy, Roxxxy,
how are you feeling
at this very moment?
- Oh, my God,
words cannot express
how happy I am to be here
and to experience this,
and y'all showing me
so much love.
I love it.
- Well, I know that getting
ready for the finale, you were
very emotional.
Tell me about that.
- Um, some of the things
on the show that--
how I was acting,
and I was acting that way,
it got the best of me at points,
and, you know,
I said a lot of hurtful things
to Jinkx,
and the most important thing
to me is our relationship,
and she is an amazing person
and she's extremely talented
and just as good as a competitor
as I am, if not better.
[applause]
- More than ever before,
a lot of people
have attacked you online about
how you were on the show.
How has that affected you?
- It's affected me a lot.
You know, you want to say
you don't listen to it
and you don't pay attention
to it, but when you're, like,
going on social media networks,
you do run into those things,
and it hurts my feelings,
and you know, I just
have to pick myself back up.
Like--you know what I'm saying?
Like, you can't let it
get you down, just, you know,
that there's people out there
who do love you
and do understand where
you are coming from
and have been
in that same place.
We're all human.
We all make mistakes.
That was completely messy,
and I can't believe
I went there,
but I shouldn't have done that.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to Jinkx right now?
- I love you to death,
and regardless of the things--
I wrote her, and I've written
you and I've told you that,
you know, I love you.
- And called me personally.
- And regardless if I win, lose,
or draw this contest,
she's somebody that I want
in my life
for the rest of my life,
and I have learned so much
from her and Alaska.
- Now, Jinkx, is there anything
you'd like to say to Roxxxy?
- I think people forget
sometimes that even though
sisters love each other,
sisters can also get
into some pretty bad fights,
you know?
But through all of it,
we're sisters.
- I think you two hookers
should hug it out.

- [laughs]
- Okay.
[laughs]
- And if I may, I think
you're both awful.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Sadly, your legendary
drag mother Erica Andrews
recently passed away.
Did she get to see the show?
- She was at the hospital,
and she was texting me,
and she was telling me,
um, how proud she was of me
and, you know, she got to see
at least two episodes,
and then she ended up passing.
She was a wonderful person,
and if you ever got to meet her,
you knew exactly...
How beautiful she was, and...
[sniffs]
The hardest thing was during
rehearsal yesterday.
I had a little breakdown.
Those were the times
I would call her
and she would know exactly
what to tell me,
and I didn't have her to call
yesterday,
but my heart always tells me
what she would say,
and I knew inside,
she was just,
"Pick yourself up,
show them how beautiful
"you can be inside and out,
and...
walk with your head
held high."
- That's right. I love it.
I got to tell you,
you are my child now.
We, as gay people,
like I said before,
we get to choose the families.
We create families on our own
on this journey,
and all of my girls--you--
all of the girls
on this stage and the girls
in the audience,
we are one big, happy family,
and we will all be
there for one another.
Promises? Okay.
[cheers and applause]
-<i> We are seconds away</i>

Now, if, for any reason,
our queen is unable
to perform her duties,
Coco Montrese
has graciously volunteered
to finish out your reign.
[cheers and applause]
Too much?
Is it--was it too soon
for that joke?
- No!
- No!
- Now, I want to give
a shout-out
to my two best squirrel friends,
Santino Rice
and Michelle Visage.
[cheers and applause]
Can you smell me?
- Yes.
- Any last words?
- Your sequence brocog gown
is real "eloguent."

- Yes.
- Are you ready?
both: Good luck,

[all exclaiming, yelling]
- I'm trying to get
everything I can.
<i>Girls pushing and prodding</i>
<i>and jumping on top of my head.</i>
Ow!
That's my leg.
This is crazy, honey.
- Out of my way! Oh!
- The girl next to me
throws the lid up...
[slow-motion voices]
I won't make it out of this
competition alive.
[laughs]
- Oh! My garbage!
[overlapping chatter]
- I can't get out of here!
- Ay, damn!
Penny Tration smacked my face,
honey.
My moneymaker!
I was pissed.
Don't knock me over.
- Don't knock you over?
This pushy little queen
over here getting on my nerves!
<i>I am not afraid</i>
<i>to shove my way</i>
through the little girls...
Mommy!
And get what I need to get.
- I am gagged,
and not in the good way.
- I got a steal!
- Five-finger discount.
Mm-hmm.
- Ooh!
- All right.
Let's get to work.
- Shopping spree,
shopping spree.
No credit card involved.
<i>We entered back</i>
<i>into the workroom,</i>
and it was time to get to work.
- Whoo, girl!
- Fabulous.
- What are you wearing, Roxxxy?
- This is my makeup dress.
- Why?
- Because I take my makeup off
in it.
Oh, y'all can't take me?
Oh, y'all cannot take
my fishy daytime dress.
- Miss Alaska,
put some clothes on, please.
- First one naked!
- Tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka!
- Look at this.
-<i> The reason she walked in</i>
<i>the room with a horse face...</i>
was 'cause she is a horse.
- Talk about letting it all
hang out, darling.
- Bitch, I live for this.
- Oh, my God,
how did you get that?
-<i> ♪ Welcome to the ♪</i>
<i>♪ Jungle ♪</i>
- What is that?
- Miss Thang!
- You found that?
- She hit the jackpot!
We got the winner.
- I am happy with what I got
from the dumpster.
I found fabulous
red sequined fabric.
- Ooh, girl,
you got paillettes!
- Mister sisters over here.
- Mister sister?
- Mister sisters.
- Mister sisters?
- Mister sisters.
- It's so funny.
As soon as she pulled out
all them red paillettes,
you are now her best friend.
She's trying to take
Miss Thing's fabric.
She can't be bothered
right now.
- She got Miss Thing
to cut it up.
- What are they talking about
over there?
- Jade, be careful, girl.
- Be careful with her.
- Why you say be careful
to me, Miss Coco?
- Just be careful.
That's all I'm saying.
- Here she comes.
- Miss Jade.
Find out who your real friends
are,
and you stick by
your real friends.
- Girl, you're my real friend,
bitch.
- I'm not saying Alyssa's not.
- You can meet your friends'
longevity, right?
'Cause we've been in
competition.
- We have been in a lot of
competitions.
- And at the end of the day,
it's like you really, truly find
who your friends are
in the end.
- Yeah. That's true.
- That's what it's about.
- So we'll talk about it later,
Alyssa.
- We don't got nothing
to talk about.
- We do have--we have a lot to
talk about.
You say you'll find out later
who your friends are.
So you and I will sit down
and talk about that.
- I wanna know what the fuck
happened.
- When are you gonna tell me?
- Not gonna answer that.
When I'm ready.
-<i> I'm definitely feeling</i>
<i>the pressure because</i>
I floundered
in the dunk tank.
<i>So hopefully, I can redeem</i>
<i>myself.</i>
-<i> Alaska's a one-trick pony</i>
<i>at this point,</i>
<i>because yet again,</i>
she's making another dress
out of plastic bags.
- Saran Wrap?
<i>It's red carpet, honey.</i>
This might get you
on the bottom two.
Good luck.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- I just wanted to keep it
kinda classy.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of influences
there.
- This is my plastic
evening gown.
I just see it in my brain.
- Okay.
-<i> I hope it's couture</i>
enough.
- [laughing]
- I need like wire cutters.
<i>This week's main challenge</i>
is making dumpster
red carpet couture.
- Where's some pins,
straight pins?
- I don't know.
-<i> The workroom's really tense</i>
<i>at the moment,</i>
'cause everyone's designing
their first runway look.
And it's important to make
a first impression.
- Everyone's all quiet.
That means you guys are
stressed.
-<i> Being an artist,</i>
I feel like the best thing
to do is just, you know,
concentrate on your concept,
chew as much as you can chew,
and you hope that whatever
you spit out comes out right.
-<i> Serena's going very slow.</i>
<i>She's doing this and that,</i>
<i>but there's just kind of</i>
<i>no product being made.</i>
And time's ticking down.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi!
- Now, is this the real
drag queens of Beverly Hills?
all: Yes!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, hello, Coco Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, this outfit...
- I want to give
Debbie Reynolds...
Marilyn Monroe
meets Madonna.
I just wanted to keep it
kind of classy.
- Yeah.
Well, there's a lot of
influences there.
-<i> I don't wanna play it safe.</i>
<i>One way or another,</i>
I need to stand out.
<i>So take it or leave it,</i>
<i>this is me tomorrow,</i>
and I'm gonna turn it.
- I know that you have a history
with Alyssa.
Has it gotten in the way so far
in the competition?
- It...kinda threw me.
<i>This Alyssa situation</i>
is a distraction for me
right now.
<i>And I need to put it aside</i>
<i>and focus on</i>
what Coco's gonna present.
- All right, Coco.
- Thank you.
- You're taking a risk,
and I love it, so go for it.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Serena ChaCha.
- Hi, Ru.
- How long have you been
doing drag?
- For three years.
Just turned 21,
just graduated art school.
I do performance art.
- Performance art.
- Yeah.
- Now, do you sew?
- Yes, but there is
a new art movement
called soft sculpture.
It's more about creating
a sculpture
rather than just tailoring.
- Well, that sounds great
on paper,
but what does it look like?
- It looks like this.
- That scares me.
- I'm trying to do detail
first,
just like when you paint.
- There's not a lot of time
here, you know.
- A little scared about that.
- And there's not a lot of dress
over here either.
- No, it's still really abstract
right now,
but I know it's gonna
come together.
-<i> Serena said she went</i>
<i>to art school.</i>
She might want her money back.
- I'm just surprised that
you're so calm and collected,
you know?
There's a lot of experienced
queens here
who are a little further along
in their execution
of their couture outfit.
-<i> All I have to do is come up</i>
<i>with a whole</i>
performative aspect for my
dress, and I'm totally calm.
I know this is gonna work out.
I totally do.
- Well, listen, I know you got
a lot of work to do here.
I can tell.
- I do.
- So get back to it.
- Okay, I will.
Thank you, Ru, I appreciate it.
- All right.
Roxxxy Andrews!
- RuPaul!
- Look at you, girl!
- Girl, I'm rushing.
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.
You know, losing weight
when I was a kid,
you know, I had to take
a lot of my clothes in
'cause we didn't have
a lot of money.
- Now, have you recently lost
a lot of weight?
- I did lose.
I've lost like 70 pounds.
- 70 pounds?
- 70 pounds.
- And how has that affected
the way you dress
and the way you feel?
- Well, girl, now I show
a little more body
than I used to be able to.
I used to be in eight corsets,
ten girdles and not being able
to breathe.
I used to be a big-ger girl.
<i>But I still consider myself</i>
<i>a girl</i>
<i>who's got a little meat</i>
<i>on her bones.</i>
And whether you're juicy, fat,
whatever,
embrace what you got
and work with it.
- You're not a big girl.
You're a thick girl.
- I'm a thick--I'm juicy.
- Oh, okay!
All right, I'm down with that.
- Right?
- Listen, I'm gonna let you get
back to work here.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you.
Penny Tration!
- RuPaul!
- Hi!
You are our fan favorite.
The fans chose you.
- I know.
Which is amazing to me.
I now have a true respect
for politicians.
All the begging and the pleading
and the votes.
- So tell me what you're doing.
The silhouette has sort of
a drop waist.
- Yes, what I have
is this crazy torso,
so what I try and do
is elongate it a bit,
bring it down to my knees,
and then--
- You bring your torso down
to your knees?
- Well, ish.
Make the length come down here.
- Uh-huh.
Well, you know, you were very
enterprising
in your campaigning
to get here,
so you've gotta be able
to translate that
into your couture outfit.
- Yes.
<i>I am going for</i>
a look that is more classic.
<i>Penny Tration is not Lady Gaga</i>
and nor does she wanna be.
- Bring it, mama.
- I'll do my best.
- All right.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Get to work.
The 49th state!
Alaska.
- Hi.
- You're finally here.
- I know, yay!
- How many times have you
auditioned for this show?
- Um, every time that
you're allowed to
and sometimes when you're not
even accepting applications.
- Well, you've worked so hard
to get here for so many years,
and then I was a little bit
surprised that, in the tank,
you sort of kind of gave up.
I just want to encourage you
to just go for it
every single time.
Now, tell me, what are you
working on?
- This is my plastic
evening gown.
- Uh-huh.
- I didn't wanna shy away
from making it look
like it came out
of a dumpster.
- Well, the challenge
is to turn trash into flash.
-<i> Ru is looking at this</i>
<i>a little funny,</i>
<i>and I know I'm taking a risk.</i>
<i>I hope it's couture</i>
enough.
I just see it in my brain.
- Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, ladies, gather round.
Now, tomorrow, for your
RuPaullywood premiere,
our extra-special guest judges
will be my old friend
Mike Ruiz...
- Yes!
- And from<i> The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Beverly Hills,</i>
your new BFF, Camille Grammer.
[cheering]
And you only get one chance
to make a first impression.
So don't fuck it up.
<i>Coming up...</i>
-<i> Little bitty Serena--</i>
she's fucking irritating
the shit out of me.
- I have a feeling you just
like to be the only pretty one.
- You're so immature, it's just
really aggravating.
- [laughing]
- Oh!
- Here we go.
Let's get to work, ladies.
-<i> Today is our first</i>
<i>elimination.</i>
Somebody's going home.
Somebody's lip syncing
for their life,
<i>and it's kinda scary.</i>
- That's a lot of unique pieces
of couture clothing.
- I'm finna' get
all nasty rich!
You think Michelle
would like that?
Just pearls hanging off
her boobs, baby.
- Very you.
Very you.
- She likes to come over
and try to throw me off.
She used to do that when
we were in competition.
- Don't worry.
She thinks that
she is very fashion,
but she dresses like a Dracula.
- How are you feeling?
- I am, you know,
back and forth
between nervous and excited.
- I'm not nervous at all.
I don't know if I should feel
bad for it
or if I should feel nervous
about not being nervous.
- I always go by,
if you're not nervous,
then there's something wrong.
- Time to put on<i> Little House</i>
<i>on the Prairie.</i>
Category is "daytime realness."
- I see your
Laura Ingalls Wilder,
and I give you Africa.
- She's Africa, all right.
She's a muumuu.
[laughter]
- Look, guys, it's a picture
of me and Noodles!
- Aw, Noodles.
- I miss her so much.
- Um, Alaska, who's the top,
and who's the bottom?
- Is it competitive
with you guys being together?
Are you guys competitive
against each other?
- Are you guys jealous
of each other?
- Were you bitter last year?
- Go on, don't lie.
You can tell the truth.
- We have so many questions.
- I would have been.
- Is it difficult?
- I mean, we--we have fights,
'cause it's two giant egos
in one tiny house, so...
- And isn't Sharon the superstar
of the relationship now?
- We had some difficult times
last year.
It was very hard.
- Like when she was gone
or like before she even left?
- Before she left, while she
was gone, after she got back.
We fought viciously
about her getting on
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and me not.</i>
I felt pain and rejection like
I've never felt in my life.
But as soon as that promo aired
for last year, like showing who
the cast was,
I just burst into tears...
- Aw!
- And I was like,
"I'm so proud of her."
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, that's really classy.
- I had to choose:
Am I gonna be bitter
or become her biggest fan?
And I made the right choice.
- That's classy.
- But at the same time,
you're an artist,
so that must have been
difficult.
[dramatic note]
- Yeah.
<i>I feel the pressure,</i>
<i>seeing as Sharon just won</i>
<i>this competition.</i>
<i>It's a huge insecurity of mine.</i>
[sighs]
If I was the first to go home,
I would be absolutely
just devastated.
<i>I would feel like I'd</i>
let my family down
and let myself down.
[upbeat music]
- [off-key]
<i>♪ Oh ah ah ♪</i>
- Okay.
-<i> ♪ Ah ♪</i>
- All right.
-<i> ♪ Ah ♪</i>
- That was just right next
to my ear.
- That one's gonna bug me--
that little one.
She's already starting to bug.
Little bitty Serena--
<i>she's kinda irritating,</i>
<i>and by "kinda,"</i>
I mean she's fucking irritating
the shit out of me...
<i>on a constant.</i>
- I was born and raised
in the republic of Panama.
- Where is Panama?
- It's in between Colombia
and Costa Rica.
It's one of the number one
retirement homes for Americans.
You should consider
going there.
- Not if they're all like you.
all: Ooh!
- Yeah, 'cause your mouth
doesn't shut.
- Oh, okay.
- It wears thin very quickly.
- You know, I have a feeling
you just like to be
the only pretty one.
- I just think you're annoying.
- I can handle annoying.
- I can't.
<i>Serena tries to read bitches</i>
like she can.
<i>She is loud,</i>
<i>she won't shut her mouth,</i>
and I have had it with her.
- There's funny, and there's
just like blunt rudeness.
- Can you not take it?
Is that why?
- Oh, honey, I can take it.
You're just, like, so immature,
it's just really aggravating.
- I'm sorry.
You're only 21 once,
and you only audition
for this thing once being 21
and get in right away once.
- And then you think
because you're younger,
you think that's an advantage,
when we've all done drag
longer, so...
- Does it bother you
I keep saying I'm 21?
- Well, no, not at all, I mean,
because honestly,
I look just as young as you,
but you just--
- Are you sure about that?
- Ooh!
- Easy!
- Girl, you ain't that pretty.
Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.
- Go home, Jade.
Go home.
Just go home.
Well, girls, we will see.
- We shall see.
- [laughing]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
From Jersey to L.A.,
it's my bi-coastal buddy
Michelle Visage.

Camille Grammer is here!
- Hello, Ru.
- Now, I hear they're letting
drag queens shop
in Beverly Hills.
- Oh, Ru, we've been doing that
for years.
[laughter]
- This week, it's a classic tale
of drags to riches
as we challenged our queens
to turn Beverly Hills trash
into Tinseltown class.
Now they're ready to make
their RuPaullywood
red carpet debut.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- The shape is all wrong
for you.
You're gonna get lost in it.
- It was makeup for me.
It was just awful.
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?
- [laughing]
- Commence shake...down.
First up, the queen on
everyone's lips--
Roxxxy Andrews.
Foxy Roxxxy.
- Ooh,

- Aww...
-<i> I'm walking down the runway,</i>
<i>giving them a little bit of hip</i>
<i>and body--bam!</i>
<i>This is exactly what I would</i>
<i>wear to an awards show.</i>
- All that ass.
- Like to spend a night
in the Roxxxy.
- She has a huge opening...
weekend.
And her box office
ain't bad either.
[laughter]
Jinkx Monsoon.
- I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. Demille.
-<i> I'm serving 100% aquamarine</i>
<i>Grecian red carpet couture.</i>
<i>I am in heaven right now.</i>
- I dream of Jinkx.
- Loofah, my ass!
[laughter]

- Yes!
-<i> I'm serving</i>
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i>

by the way.
[laughter]
Ivy Winters!
The ladyboy in red.
-<i> I feel really amazing</i>
<i>because I know that</i>
<i>the garment</i>

For your consideration,
Honey Mahogany.

<i>I am a million bucks,</i>
<i>and nothing can bring me down</i>
<i>right now.</i>

Wow.

- It's very drama-filled.
- The bird flew the coop
on this one.
- Yes.
-<i> I'm serving dark and twisted</i>
<i>Alyssa Edwards realness.</i>
<i>My blood is flowing</i>
<i>and my heart is pumping,</i>
<i>and my mind is in it</i>
<i>to win it.</i>
- Somebody took the Black Swan
and mated with the matador.
- And now we've got bird flu.
- Yes.
Penny Tration.
- [laughs]
Yes, please.
- Penny for your thoughts.
-<i> I'm walking slow and letting</i>
<i>them take</i>
<i>all the Penny Tration in.</i>
<i>And I make sure</i>
<i>they can get to see</i>
<i>the backside of Penny Tration.</i>
- You better sissy that walk,
girl.
- All right!
- You better sissy that walk.
- Hey!
- I wonder if she has a twin.
She'd be double Penny Tration.
[laughter]
- Coco Montrese.
- Action!
- She is ready for her close-up.
- Somebody blow into those
bullhorns.
- I know.
-<i> I'm booking it down</i>
<i>the runway,</i>
<i>giving it to you.</i>
<i>I am serving you</i>
<i>old Hollywood.</i>
<i>White woman fish, baby!</i>
- Now, she's a drag queen,
but she really wants to direct.
- Don't we all?
You, on top.
- Vivienne Pinay.
- Oh!
- Oooh!
- Cache spokeswoman.
- Uh-huh.
-<i> I'm giving face,</i>
<i>and I'm giving body.</i>
<i>Hands down, I am the fishiest</i>
<i>bitch in this competition.</i>
- Very J.Lo.
- Mwah!
Box office gold.
She's ready
for the casting couch.
The 49th state--Alaska.
all: Oh!
- That's gorgeous.
- Is that a Birkin bag
or a Glad bag?
[laughter]
-<i> So that dress is made of</i>
<i>plastic,</i>
<i>but I am treating it</i>
<i>like the most expensive</i>
<i>couture gown ever.</i>
<i>And I just wiggle my way down</i>
<i>the runway as best I can.</i>
- She must have
a really big dog.
[laughter]
Alaska.
Oh, dear, I can see Russia

- Is that Sarah Palin
in that dress?
- It's Saran Palin.
[laughter]
Lineysha Sparx.
- Ooh, glamour.
- Balenciaga!
- Yes.
- She's really working it.
- That's how she walks
to the grocery store.
What are you talking about?

<i>and my design is flawless.</i>
- And she's got a shoe
on her head.
- Oh, yeah!
- She has a foot up
on the others.

I'll tell you that.
She's got Lisa Vanderpump

[laughter]

- Ooh! Look at those legs.
Legs forever!
-<i> I'm feeling extra,</i>

- Via the Suez Canal.
- Yes.
[laughter]
-<i> Serena ChaCha</i>
<i>is a drag scholar.</i>
<i>I feel avant-garde, couture,</i>
<i>editorial, like some sort of</i>
<i>surreal painting.</i>
<i>I'm giving them something</i>
<i>different.</i>
- It's like Shakira meets...
- Pinocchio?
- Who you calling a lederhosen?
[laughter]
- Cha cha cha!
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your Hollywood splash
photo session
and your red carpet
couture presentation,
I've made some decisions.
When I call your name, please
step forward.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Detox.
Honey Mahogany.
Monica Beverly Hillz.
Vivienne Pinay.
Alyssa Edwards.
Coco Montrese.
To be America's next
drag superstar,
you need to snatch
the world's attention
at every turn.
And unfortunately tonight...
you are...
the S word.
Safe.
- I didn't come to this
competition just to be safe.
<i>I am here to show people</i>
<i>I still got it.</i>
- Anyone who says it's an honor
just to be nominated...
is one lying bitch.
You may leave the stage.
Oh, ladies...
one more thing.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
That's all.
<i>Coming up...</i>
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.
- What's exposed just looks
like boy.
It was all a mess.
- The time has come...
for you to lip sync...
for your life.
[laughing]
Ladies, you represent the best
and the worst of the week.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Out of all the dresses,
this is the one
that I would be wearing.
Absolutely gorgeous.
- Everything you've done
was just perfect to your curves,
and you revealed enough skin
to keep it classy.
Look at that!
- You just wanna show your ass.
- [laughs]
- I don't know
if you guys noticed,
but when I showed you my shoes,
they're RuPaul shoes.
- I noticed.
- And I found them
in the dumpster.
- What?
- What?
- Who would throw those away?
- I don't know.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Next up, Ivy Winters!
- Ivy.
Ooh!
- This dress is absolutely
gorgeous.
You sewed this whole thing?
- I did. I hand-stitched it
completely.
- I was looking at you
and I'm like,
where's the trash?
You kinda have to bring in
some kind of
unconventional material
into this challenge.
- Thank you, Ivy Winters.
Next up, Jade Jolie.
- Hey, Ru, hey!
- You have the sweetest,
softest voice.
- [deep voice] You've never
said that to me, Mike.
[laughter]
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.
There's too many details all
crying out for my attention.
- This is very much my
personality,
kinda like taste
the crazy rainbow kinda girl.
- What does the rainbow
taste like?
- Butterflies and unicorns?
- Yeah. Lisa Frank,
all that good stuff.
- Oh, I love it!
You are just a cute little
thing, aren't you?
- You're a cute little thing.
- I could eat you up
in one bite. Argg!
- All right, thank you, Jade.
Next up, Penny Tration.
What do you got to say for
yourself?
- I'm so glad to be here.
There's a lot to see.
Take a look.
- I think with the dress,
it starts to fall apart
after the bust line.
The left and the right look like
different shapes.
- I just think if you took this
front slit
and made it into a side slit,
I think it would have
been just more flattering.
- One thing I notice is,
your shading is very dark.
Black, dare I say.
- The black on the side looks
like a sideburn almost.
- Next up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Now, did you have any difficulty
putting this outfit together?
- Getting it on my body.
I don't have a zipper.
You can't really sew into
plastic.
- You know, the thing is,
you can take something
that costs nothing
and turn it into something
that looks like
a million dollars.
And you did it tonight.
- Thank you.
- Why no earrings?
- I lost them in the dumpster.
[laughter]
- I like the way you have
accessorized it.
I don't think you need
anything more,
'cause you've got
a lot of shimmer going on
because of the plastic
Saran Wrap.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.
- Puerto Rico in the house.
-<i> Que bella.</i>
This is really elegant.
What is that?
- It's wallpaper, actually.
- Is it really?
- Yes.
- It's brilliant.
- I mean, really impressed
because that is not an easy
thing to work with.
And you made it look
really couture.
- I love the shoe as well
in your hair.
- Yes.
- Repurposed.
- That's really using
your head.
[laughter]
- I love the way you've created
this piece.
- This is because if I need to
do the lip synch,
I can do it like this.
[singing gibberish]
[laughter]
- Thank you, Lineysha.
Serena ChaCha.
-<i> Hola.</i>
- I had a little bit
of an issue
with what you're wearing;
I'm not gonna lie.
The shape is all wrong for you.
You're gonna get lost in it.
And then what's exposed
just looks like boy.
- It looks like you've done
your makeup
in a lighter shade
than your body.
And it almost looks like
if you pulled the head
off of one doll
and put it onto the body of,
like, a G.I. Joe figure.
And this collar really adds this
big weight
around your neck that separates
your head from your body.
- Can I see it without
the neck thing?
- It looks so much prettier.
- I wanna say that I'm open for
all the criticism.
And I'm making sure to put it
toward the next challenge,
whatever that may be.
- All right.
Well, thank you.
Well, ladies, I think we've
heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, kids.
Just between us "goils"...
let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy had a very convincing
couture red carpet look
and a great blend of fabrics
and unconventional materials.
- She combined goth with glam.
And I thought she looked great.
- Completely thought-out.
Like she knows what her shape
is all about.
- I do have a con
with Roxxxy Andrews.
I wanted to see more ass.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- I mean, the dress
was beautiful.
But I really couldn't stop
looking at her hair
because I just didn't like it,
'cause this gown was
so "elegwent"--
"eloguent."
- You real "eloguent."
- That's my new word.
- You speak "eloguent."
- "Eloguent."
- Talk about couture.
I mean, she hand-stitched
that dress.
- As beautiful as the dress was,
where's the trash?
I didn't get that same kind of
feeling that I get
when I look at Alaska
or Lineysha.
- Lineysha's "eloguent."
- [laughs]
All right, let's move on to
Jade Jolie.
My goodness, Jade Jolie.
She had a lot on.
- I can't really tell where
her taste level is because--
- I think you can.
I think you can.
- She has a very fantastical
sort of outlook on life
about rainbows and unicorns
and all.
But I just don't think
it was very well executed.
- Let's talk about
Penny Tration.
- She came out
with a great attitude.
I get the whole Mae West kinda,
"Come up and see me sometime"
thing going on.
But then you kinda scroll down
a little bit.
- The padding was asymmetrical.
It looked like she had
a tilted pelvis.
Somebody call the osteopath
or something.
- [laughs]
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?
- It is not.
You could be a big girl,
make those proportions
work for you
and actually look couture,
and she didn't.
- Yeah, but it was the makeup
for me.
It was just awful.
- That was probably
the best part, Camille.
[laughter]
- All right, let's head on
to the 49th state,
Alaska.
- I wasn't really expecting much
from Alaska
based on her performance
in the photo shoot.
But a little Saran Wrap
went a long way tonight.
The only thing is, it should've
had a little slit
'cause she had some difficulty
walking in it.
- My one thing was,
I would've loved to have seen
sparkly earrings up on that.
- Well, Michelle,
Alaska's not from New Jersey.
- [laughs]
- All right, let's move on
to Lineysha Sparx.
- What a gorgeous face
on this one.
- Yes.
- The gown was absolutely
gorgeous.
And when we found out that
it was wallpaper,
I was even more impressed.
- And to put a shoe, a pump,
in her hair,
I thought that was really fun
and whimsical.
- You're right.
And it could've very easily been
a disaster.
- But all in all, she's what
we call a TP.
- A total package,
that's right.
Let's talk ChaCha,
as in Serena ChaCha.
- Oh, God.
She literally
was drag Pinocchio.
It was lederhosen.
It was really like I was waiting
for yodeling.
It was all just a mess.
- She was showing so much of
this kind of, like,
oiled up chest.
- And it was like a little boy
with a costume on.
- I think that
she has to start thinking
about her tiny, little body
and the way she's gonna
execute her fashions.
- Well, she executed this
fashion.
[laughter]
- She sure did.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Ivy Winters, your red gown
looked like it was ripped from
the pages of<i> Vogue.</i>
You're safe.
Alaska,
you had this challenge
in the bag.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Roxxxy Andrews,
you dove deep
into the dumpsters
of Beverly Hills
and made rubbish
look ravishing.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
You receive a custom gown
by Marco Marco,
plus immunity from elimination
next week.
-<i> Are you kidding me right now?</i>
<i>I'm on cloud nine.</i>
Suck that--aah!
Thank you
for believing in me.
- You may join the other girls.
Lineysha Sparx,
you lit up the runway
in classic Hollywood glamour.
You're safe.
-<i> I thought that</i>
I was gonna win.
<i>But whatever.</i>
- Serena ChaCha,
on the runway
you moved like Jagger,
but your red carpet look
was "coutorture."
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
-<i> Oh, crap.</i>
You really messed up.
<i>I do not wanna be the first</i>
<i>person sent home.</i>
This cannot fucking happen
at this point.
- Penny Tration, we love your
dangerous curves.
But your red carpet couture
veered off in the wrong
direction.
Jade Jolie, you didn't wear
your dress.
It wore you.
But still, your personality
shined through.
Jade Jolie...
you're safe.
- [exhales]
Thank you guys so much.
- Wait.
Hold up, mama.
May I give you a word of advice?
- Yes.
- Edit.
- Edit?
- That's right.
- Thank you so much.
- Penny Tration, I'm sorry,
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.
- [deep breath]
<i>I'm disappointed</i>
<i>because there are</i>
a lot of people who really
wanted me to be here.
<i>And I'm letting them down.</i>
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync for your life.
-<i> This is my last chance</i>
<i>for the world to see</i>
why I deserve to be here.
<i>You better work.</i>
Like, you better work.
That's it.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

Serena ChaCha...
Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- [crying]
- Penny Tration, even though
this isn't
the Hollywood ending
you dreamed of,
never, ever stop
reaching for the stars.
- Don't worry about that.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you all.
[applause]
<i>Given the circumstances,</i>
<i>I don't have any regrets.</i>
I don't think there's much else
I would've done differently.
<i>And I'm not sure</i>
<i>that there's much else</i>
<i>I would be able to show them.</i>
And my family's
already proud of me,
regardless
of what happens here.
- My lucky, lucky 13,
condragulations.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.

- Previously on
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Coco Montrese.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- We haven't spoken
in two years.
The pageant
tore our friendship apart.
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later together,
'cause we need a moment.
- You'll be lip-synching
to the spoken word, darling.
- I think Lineysha
is going to struggle the most
because of the language barrier.
- This is not
<i>Rupaul's Best Friend Race.</i>
- No [bleep], Sherlock.
I'm not focused, because I have
so much going on in my head.
[choked up]
I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
- One of you really
lip-smacked the competition.
Lineysha Sparx.
- [laughs]
- Monica Beverly Hillz...
Shante, you stay.
Serena Chacha...
sashay away.
[footsteps approach]
- [sighs]
- Chacha,<i> adios,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darling.</i>
- We're back in the workroom,
and Serena went home.
Came a mess.
Left a mess.
- Ooh!
[laughter]
- As you can tell,
I am just very upset.
[laughs]
- "Keep hearing light."
What does that mean?
- "Bearing light."
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.
'Cause the only thing I was
hearing was "Sashay away."
[laughter]
- Well, on that note.
[sighs]
I'm happy I survived
the lip-synch.
And I let out a huge secret.
It really took a toll today,
and I just felt like,
you know what?
I can't hold
that secret no more.
- Yeah, seriously.
- Be proud.
- We all love you.
- We love you.
- So, speaking of secrets,
what the hell is going on
with you and Coco?
- Look, at the end of the day,
this, right here, I won.
- Mm.
- But who's in the picture?
- Miss Coco.
- I think you should ask Coco.
- I want to know the T
on what happened
between you and Alyssa...
- Oh, God.
- Because this has been
going on for so long.
- They crowned her
that night, you know?
And things happen, and...
obligations weren't fulfilled.
And it put us in a situation
where our friendship
was on the line.
- 'Cause you took her spot.
- Legally, I had to do that.
- Every story has two sides.
- With all the controversy
at Miss Gay America,
this is a personal vendetta
for myself.
I think it's time for me
to get this off my chest.
- The winner of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour,
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight,
extra special guest judges
Paulina Porizkova and Coco.
- Whoo!
- Whoo.
- Yay!
- [together]
Rolaskatox.
- It's a new day.
I'm walking into the workroom,
wondering what the hell
is about to happen.
No more groups.
- No.
- No more groups.
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Hey, my little ladyboys.
all: Hey.
- Growing up is so overrated,
and America's next
drag superstar
needs to really embrace
her inner child
if she's gonna become one fierce
mother-tucker.
This message was brought to you
by the letter T.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[overlapping greetings]
Do you know what time it is?
all: No.
- It's time for the junior
drag superstar pageant!
- Oh!
[all exclaiming]
- Instantly, I'm thinking,
"A pageant?"
This is my gig, and I've been
quite successful at it.
- But, ladies, you won't be
the contestants.
You need to turn these boy toys
into cutie patooties.
[giggles]
[laughter]
Pick a partner.
- I looked to the left and said,
"Oh, hell no.
I'm not working with Alyssa."
- You've got 15 minutes.
The team with the most sickening
painted baby will win.
Ready, set, drag the children.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
- You know, we're all
considered kai kai now.
We have daughters
with another queen.
- Our girl's gonna win
grand supreme.
You just watch.
- Little flippers.
- [laughs]
- Don't mess it up,
or you won't get no go-go juice.
I immediately
turn into pageant mom.
Now, I never could make it
in the pageant scene
when I was a girl, so you're
so lucky you get to do this.
- Time's up.
Now, may I present the drag
superstars of tomorrow.
First up,
Roxxxy Andrews and Detox.
- Hi, I'm Rachel Zoe,
and this is our daughter,
Vaxeline Androxxx Zoe.
She just wants to go to Paris
every weekend and see the shows,
dressed in
all the finest couture.
And because I'm Rachel Zoe,
we allow that.
- [laughs]
- She's kind of a big deal.
[camera shutter snaps]
- I'd like to present
little Tina Lou Devereaux.
She wants to make makeup
and fashionable accessories
more accessible to young girls,
because it is never too young
to start upholding
the "Amurrican" ideal
of "femininitity".
[laughter]
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.
- Watermelon is decked out
in glitz,
glamour, and a flipper
she's able to grow into
for the years to come.
She's a world champion
watermelon seed spitter.
- [laughs]
- I present to you
our very own Savannah Lee.
She is a former Miss Mesquite,
Little Miss America.
Her platform in life
is world peace for all.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
[applause]
- Now that's a modern family.
- I'd like everyone to meet
Lil' Pound Cake.
Her catchphrase is,
"You're not my real dad,
and you never will be."
- [laughing]
- Lil' Pound Cake
enjoys riding dirty
and being a straight-up
mother [bleep] [bleep] pig.
[laughter]
- [cackling]
- Monica and I have our
daughter, Patty Park Place.
She's won several pageants,
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.
- Oh!
- Coco Montrese decides
to throw a little bit of shade
to be real cute.
I don't get cute.
I get drop-dead gorgeous.
[whispers] Shade.
- So, the miss junior
drag superstar is...
Lil' Pound Cake.
- Oh!
- All hail Lil' Pound Cake.
[camera shutter snaps]
Now, for this week's
main challenge,
you'll be creating lovable,
eccentric characters
for your own
kidster television shows.
[all exclaiming]
- Children's TV?
I'm like, "What the
mother [bleep] hell?"
- Your target audience
is the young
and the young at heart,
so your program
should be both entertaining
and "edumacational."
You'll be working in two groups.
Lineysha and Alaska, since
you won the mini-challenge,
you'll be team captains.
Lineysha, you pick first.
- Honey.
- Toxie.
- Coco Montrese.
- Hey, girl.
- Roxxx-an.
- Rolaskatox!
both: Rolaskatox!
[laughter]
- Jinkx.
- Vivienne.
- [nasal voice]
Ivy Winterrr.
[laughs]
[nasal voice]
Winterrrs.
- "Montica".
- Yay.
- All right, Lineysha.
Who do you choose next?
- [whispers indistinctly]
We were all in Lineysha's ear
saying, "Don't pick Alyssa."
- Jade.
- [whispers] Thank God.
- So Alyssa will go
to Alaska's team.
- Darling.
- I might have been picked last,
but honestly,
I ended up on the team
that I wanted to be on.
The queens of the competition.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- I have a idea.
Why you can't make,
like, a muppet,
and take talking like,
"la la la la," and--
- Ohh.
- Ventriloquist?
- Ventriloquist, so--
- Yes, you,
and she's the little girl.
- Oh,
like a ventriloquist dummy.
- Girl, they 'bout to try
to send me home.
In the show in Vegas,
I'm the star.
So when you give me a role
like a ventriloquist doll...
- So what are some things
that we can talk about?
Um...
- Um...
- Now is the hard part.
We have to actually
come up with the material.
I'm trying to find out--figure
out how to make it funny.
- This is really, really hard.
- At some point,
I think Coco got frustrated
and kind of walked off.
- I want to wear my hair up.
I'll be glad when
the group challenges are over.
- I'm kind of panicking.
How are we gonna pull this off?
- Coming up...
It never occurred to me that
you'd actually be out of drag.
- I'm in drag, Ru.
- But you're in a male drag.
- I heard that you went around
everywhere and badmouthed me.
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.
- [laughing]
- So our challenge
is to put together
a children's television show
which is full of sneaky little
dirty double-entendres.
Our word of the day is "box."
This is the challenge
that I've been waiting for.
Finally we get to act
and we get to write
and we get to create.
I'm gonna be a farmer.
And we can each be,
like, a barnyard animal.
- I'll be the chicken lady.
- And you should be, like,
Venus Xtravaganza.
You should be her.
"Oh, you wanna talk about..."
both: "Reading, dahling."
- You can just be Uncle Dick
the cross-dresser.
- Be, like,
real butch about it.
[rough voice]
Look at how pretty I am.
And not fishy.
- Really?
The cross-dressing uncle?
Girl, they're pulling the patch.
Can't be bothered.
Do you think
it would be more funny,
'cause she's fishier than me,
if she was the Uncle Dick?
- I like you
as a cross-dresser.
I'm a little worried about
Alyssa because she's very much
into, "Oh,
Alyssa has to look this way,
and Alyssa
has to look that way."
And I hope that doesn't
hold us back.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all shouting greetings]
Did I catch you boys
playing dress-up?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, hello, team Alaska.
all: Hi, Ru.
- How's it going over here?
- It's going.
- Who's gonna be your host?
- Hi.
- Now, what character
are you doing?
- Buffalo Bill.
- Oh, okay.
- And, um, it's a barnyard,
and our show is called something
like<i> Barnyard Boogers.</i>
- [laughs]
So who's doing
the word of the day?
- That's me.
- What is the word of the day?
- Box.
- Box?
- B-o-x.
- Of course.
And it's just now coming to me
how you can make--
- A lot of things
come in my box.
- [laughs] Yes, a lot of things
could come in your box, exactly.
[laughter]
Now, what are you kids doing?
- She's teaching the social
lesson of the day.
- Don't be throwing no shade.
- And how do you get kids
to not throw shade?
Well, you know,
the thing about these shows,
especially, like,<i> </i>
<i>Pee-wee's Playhouse,</i>
is that a lot
of what you're doing here
has a subversive twist to it.
Do you have a message
that you're trying to convey
to the children?
- Down with communism.
[laughter]
- Okay.
You guys have
a lot of work to do,
and I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, team Lineysha.
all: Hi.
- So tell me about your
kidster show.
Who's gonna do your "how to"
segment?
- Lineysha and myself.
- Oh, really?
- We are making banana splits.
- In two languages.
- What are you gonna do to
really send it over the top?
- It's gonna be funny.
[laughs]
- All right.
Are you the host?
- Yes, Lineysha asked me
to be the host.
- And which--
what part of the challenge
have you been assigned?
- Actually, Coco and I
are both doing
the social lesson
for the day.
- Which is what?
- It's "Always tell the T."
- Of course.
- T.T. and Tiny.
T.T.'s always teaching Tiny
to tell the T.
- Right.
Are you gonna be able
to bring the funny, though?
- I think we're gonna
focus more on quality
and not quantity.
- All right.
Well, you kids have a lot
to work with.
You've got a lot to do.
So I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right, turn it out.
- Thank you, Ru.
- We'll just have to show Ru
that we all can be funny.
- Look, do you like that look?
- You look like Willam.
- [laughs]
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi, Rupaul.
We're right about to shoot
our TV show for kids,
and I'm feeling very excited,
because I really feel like
we're gonna nail it.
- It's funny, 'cause when
we talked in the workroom,
and you said Buffalo Bill,
it never occurred to me
that you'd actually
be out of drag.
- I'm in drag, Ru.
- But you're in a male drag.
That's an interesting choice.
- Here we go.
We're going to get read
before we even start?
Two thumbs down.
- All right, Michelle and I
are here to direct you.
So show us what you got.
Action.
- Look, everybody.
It's clucky the cock!
- [clucking]
It's our secret word of the day.
You want to hear what it is?
It's "box"!
- Whoa!
- [laughs]
- Cut.
Clucky, you're delivering
your lines to Buffalo Bill.
You've got to play
more to the camera.
Action.
- So many things
fit inside my box.
- [laughing]
- This is a petite box.
I don't think it's Michelle's.
- [guffaws]
- [squawking]
Boxes!
- [lisping]
I am so excited to be here!
I'm ready to toss
your salad, Anita.
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.
- I like a cheesy salad.
- Cut. Vivienne...
- Yeah?
- If you can bring your energy
up to meet Roxxxy's--
- Okay.
- It feels like you're in
two different sketches.
- You get lost.
- [flat] Say, let's go get our
other friends to toss our salad.
- Moving on.
- It's real sunny up here,
but I do like
a little bit of shade.
- Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?
Sunlight on the skin...
Boom. I blank.
- Cut.
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun on this skin?
Sunlight is, uh--
- Cut.
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun?
Sunlight on the skin--
[bleep].
I'm, like, totally [bleep]
my [bleep] bathing suit.
And that's not cute.
- Monica, do you want to look
at the lines again?
- Yeah, they're right here.
- Oh, they are.
- And you're not reading it?
- All right, ladies.
Fantastic.
- When you're team captain,
if the whole thing
goes like a train wreck,
then it's you
who has to pay for it.
Ugh.
- Coming up...
- A nice, plump banana.
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>
- Lineysha just literally
translated it.
- And this is my little friend.
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.
- Is that it?
[laughing]
- We're walking on set to shoot
our children's television show.
- And they are all in drag.
- Funny how that works
on<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Uh-huh.
- Comedy's kind of my thing,
so I'm really excited
to really shine.
- All right,
let's see your big opening.
- Are you guys excited
for today's episode?
The word of the day is...
"blow."
- Jinkx revealed my word, blow.
It kind of threw me off.
I had a speech ready,
and everything rhymed,
so I just had to scramble
and just kind of
come up with something quick.
If you think of blow,
I think of bubbles.
- Oh, look at all those bubbles
you're blowing!
- Blow.
[giggles]
- Cut.
Jade, it took you a little bit
longer to land the lines.
Get to the point
a little faster.
- Little aggravated.
- Action.
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.
And the ingredients are a nice,
plump banana.
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>
- Lineysha is not really
bringing the Latin flavor
that I thought
she was going to bring.
- Go ahead and cut that in half.
-<i> En Espanol,</i>
<i>cortalo por la mitad.</i>
- She just literally
translated it.
- Cherries.
- All right, moving on.
- Hello, everyone.
I'm T.T., and this
is my little friend...
we haven't even practiced.
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.
- Jessica.
- All right, cut.
- Your timing is too slow.
You need to pick it up.
Coco, you need to be on it.
- Ready, and action.
- What's the T?
Why do they really
call you Tiny?
- 'Cause I'm small.
Yeah.
I'm a ventriloquist doll.
I don't know if I'm supposed
to look at the camera,
look away from the camera.
- Coco, think more Pinocchio
and less the puppet from<i> Saw.</i>
- Do you have something
that you'd like to say?
- Is that it?
- That's it.
- All right.
Do you have any notes?
- Nope.
- Okay, that's a wrap.
all: Rolaskatox.
- It's elimination day, and
today's theme for the runway
is "think pink".
Jinkx.
- Mm-hmm?
- Are you gonna
add that hair into that hair?
- Yeah.
My grandma got me this wig
when I was, like, 17.
- So your grandma
was buying you wigs, girl?
- My mom wasn't really into it.
- Uh-huh.
- But my grandma and I
would be getting me in drag,
and then I'd go out to the club.
She'd let me be
who I wanted to be, you know?
My grandma made it possible
for me to do drag
at a very early age.
And that's when I really started
coming alive.
She helped set up my life
to put me where I am today.
So it has a lot of sentimental
value to me.
- I feel so mentally drained
right now.
I'm trying to finish my costume,
and this whole Alyssa thing,
it's still bothering me.
We competed at Miss Gay America
together.
- Huh?
- They crowned her.
I ended up having
to take over the title.
We haven't talked in two years.
- Coco, if you want to come talk
to me, you can talk to me,
but you don't have to read me
over there, though.
- I'm not reading you.
I'm not saying
anything about you.
I've got to get this
off my back.
This needs to be done.
Can I talk to you, like,
five minutes, just me and you?
- Oh, [bleep], this is gonna get
[bleep] interesting.
Let me get some popcorn.
- It was pure hell.
- Okay.
- How would you feel
if you're standing onstage
with a crown on your head,
singing your song,
and someone yells out,
"You ain't the real
Miss America anyway!"
I just smile and wave.
In the inside, I am torn.
I almost lost my relationship
because of that whole thing.
That whole thing
turned my world upside-down.
- Well, I lost
my whole reputation
I'd worked ten years for.
[chuckles]
He didn't win Miss Gay America.
I did.
So he wasn't the one embarrassed
in front of the whole community.
I was. I'm the very first
to get dethroned.
Nobody gets dethroned.
I'm not a drug addict.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a mentor. I'm a leader.
But, Coco, I heard
that you went around everywhere
and badmouthed me, saying
I couldn't fulfill my reign.
You got on your face--hold on.
Let me finish.
But, see, you're doing all that,
and you're not even
being fair to me.
- I am being fair to you.
I'm listening to you.
- Girl, you are saying, "I'm on
the beach drinking a margarita.
I'm the one with the crown.
I'm the one."
- I don't--I--
- Why did you write
on your Facebook,
"Alyssa shouldn't have won
in the first place"?
Do you feel like
that was a hit below the belt?
- [crying] I laid in bed next
to my husband, and, like, God--
he's like,
"What is wrong with you?"
And I can't--I couldn't take it.
And--
- And then the tears come out.
Coco is doing what he does best.
He's making it seem like
he's the victim.
He's always the victim.
And the Academy Award goes to...
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.
- I gave him the benefit of
the doubt and got nothing back.
- This whole thing
was not resolved.
I'm done with that situation.
I got to get ready
for the runway.
- [laughing]
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
won't you be my neighbor?
- Always, my little lemon drop.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice.
- I am ready to school
these children.
- I look at her here,
and I see seductive.
I look at her hair,
and I see wicked beauty.
Paulina Porizkova.
- I am so glad to be here.
I've been trying to get on your
damn show for five years now.
[laughter]
- Mrs. T's in the house.
Coco.
Rupaul loves Coco too.
- I love Rupaul.
- [laughs]
This week,
our queens were challenged
to create breakout characters
in their own
kidster television shows.
And tonight, they're dressed
to tickle you pink.
- Whoo.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Coming up...
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--
you bored me.
- [laughing]
First up, the 49th state,
Alaska.
So pink mafia.
- I look like a ghost
from the Civil War.
A McQueen fashion show.
- She bleeds pink.
- She's a sex pistol.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
Someone caught the bouquet.
- I'm feeling extra fishy.
My nails are right.
My hair's tight.
I'm just giving it.
- This is very
Singapore Airlines.
- Come fly with me.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- I want that outfit.
- I am channeling
my Little Miss Perfect gig.
It's the deal. It's the ish.
- Madonna reborn again.
- Yes.
- Vivienne Pinay.
- Hold me closer, tiny dancer.
[laughter]
- I'm feeling cute,
prissy, and girly.
And the judges
are really eating it up.
- Ooh.
- I think I just saw
her pink slip.
[laughter]
Next up, Detox.
- This is
<i>Playboy: The Victorian Years.</i>
- My tits are bouncing
everywhere.
I mean, I have a great body,
so why not show it off?
- Okay, no kidding,
I have this outfit.
- [laughs]
- She is a hot mesh.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Bam.
- Pink Panther on the runway.
- The dress is flowing.
I look drop-dead gorgeous.
- It's a mullet dress!
- [laughs]
- Uh-huh.
- Business in the front,
party in the back.
- Lineysha Sparx.
Sell the garment, honey.
- I feel so fierce, flawless,
like a top model.
- Looks like Cinderella's
got a hot date.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Ooh, la, la.
- Oh,<i> Dangerous Liaisons.</i>
- I am flouncing
down the runway
with my snuff box,
let them eat all this cake,
bitches.
- Marie Aqua Net.
[laughter]
- Coco Montrese.
- Shirley Temple Black?
- Why it got to be black?
- I am giving you
your baby doll fish.
I look so cute.
- I didn't know
she was into bears.
[laughter]
[nasal voice]
Ivy Winterrrs.
- Where is Crystal Conner
when you need her?
- Yes.
- I'm strutting
like a Vegas showgirl.
I feel like
a beautiful flamingo.
- You can just stick her
in somebody's front lawn.
[laughter]
- Honey Mahogany.
- She just jumped out of bed
and grabbed the duvet cover.
- Very Bed Bath and Beyonce.
- [laughs]
- I am feeling really strong,
pummeling the runway.
- That face is Iman...
- Yes.
- But that walk
is pure pissed off.
[laughter]
- Jade Jolie.
- Work it.
- Very<i> Girls Next Door</i>
Holly Madison.
- I'm feeling so pretty in pink.
I'm serving the judges
pure fish, hunty.
- [laughs]
- Barbie girl in a Barbie world.
- Life in plastic,
it's fantastic.
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's take a look
at your kidster TV shows.
First up,<i> Barnyard Buddies.</i>
[cow moos, cow bell clanks]
- Hi, everybody!
I'm Buffalo Bill.
Let's meet
some of my amazing friends.
- [clucks]
- Look, everybody!
It's clucky the cock!
- [clucking]
Hi, kids!
- Now, I heard
you're sitting on a secret.
- It's our
secret word of the day.
Shh.
It's "box"!
- Whoa!
[laughter]
- Can I borrow your horse?
- Yeah, sure, clucky.
- Let's try to cram it
in the box!
- Cram it in! Yeah!
- Your horse won't fit
in the box!
[kids giggling]
Your horse is just too big
for my pink box!
[kids laughing]
- Look, everybody.
It's Anita Bum!
- Today we're gonna learn
how to toss salad
with my good friend,
Tasha Salad.
- [lisping] I'm so excited
to be here today.
Well, let's get started.
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.
- Now, is it harmful
to toss a dirty salad?
- Some people are into that.
- Instead of using
the uncut carrots,
can we use the cut carrots?
- Yes. What you want to do is
peel the skin back.
Cut carrots always seem
to be cleaner. Okay?
We're tossing salads one person
at a time across America.
[kids cheer]
- What's up, Fanny?
- Today I'm going to be...
teaching a social lesson.
Don't be throwing no shade.
- Look, it's everyone's
favorite cross-dresser,
Uncle Dick!
- It's real sunny up here.
But I do like
a little bit of shade.
- Don't be throwing
no shade, sir.
Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?
Sunlight on your skin
creates vitamin D
and elevates the mood, so...
all: Don't be shady.
Be a lady.
- Bye-bye, everybody!
- [clucks]
- Bye!
[laughter and applause]
- Next up,<i> The Magic Bush.</i>
- My name is Princess Pinklips.
Are you guys excited
for today's episode?
Then let's all bounce.
And now shake your hands
like this.
Ooh, isn't this fun?
Oh!
Today we have a special word of
the day.
The word of the day is...
"blow."
- I always think of bubbles.
Now with bubbles,
you really work it.
Just give it your all.
Kind of like an explosion
of bubbles.
- You're so good at blowing,
Jolly Jade.
- Well, I don't have blue lips
for no reason.
[laughter]
- Next we're going to welcome
Cherry Chocolatina
and Lola the Exploda.
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.
Now, go ahead
and peel the banana.
-<i> Suavemente, vas a pelar</i>
<i>para atras el guineo.</i>
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, Miss Lola's
favorite part is the cream.
- [panting]
Help me, girl.
[both panting and murmuring]
- Ooh! Oh!
- Oh!
- Wow.
- It exploded!
- Hello, everyone.
I'm T.T.,
and this is my little friend.
- Tiny.
- That reminds me.
It's time for
our social lesson of the day.
Always tell the T.
- Is my T my truth?
- Yes, your T is your truth.
Do you have something
that you'd like to say?
- Uh-uh.
[awkward silence]
[solo clapping]
- All right.
- I think there were
some weak links,
but I think there were some weak
links in the other team too.
At least this team's
all in drag.
- Coming up...
- You're gonna get lost,
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.
- This is<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>
[laughing]
Ladies, this week
you worked as teams,
but tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Honey Mahogany.
Ivy Winters.
Jade Jolie.
Alyssa Edwards.
Lineysha Sparx.
Lineysha, you're lucky
you have immunity.
Otherwise,
you'd be in the bottom.
The girls I've called forward,
you are all safe.
You may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent
the very best
and the very worst of the week.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- I love your dust bunny hair,
and I love your
pink splattered blood.
You are such an original.
- Tonight on the runway,
I love it.
I'm just concerned for you
with the boy-drag.
It is a drag show.
You know, I'm paying my $5.
I want to see Alaska.
- Next up,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I don't know if
during the<i> Barnyard Bunch</i>
you just got nervous,
but you need to project more,
or you're gonna get lost,
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.
- It's inside of you.
I could see that--
that Beverly Hills bitch--
when you walked out.
But then you kind of went
in your shell after a while.
- Thank you, Monica.
Vivienne Pinay.
- Tonight you look really cute.
It's unfortunate that
you created that character
and then that it
kind of fell so flat.
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--
you bored me.
- Moving on to...
♪ Detox ♪
- Your costume wasn't
my favorite part of you.
It was really just,
like, your jokes
and your mannerisms
and your volume.
- You rock the stage.
You rock it in acting.
I really like the shake
in the boobies.
Yeah, thank you.
- I know I had a lot of
competition up here tonight...
- Yes, right?
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- You float above the concrete.
- Thank you.
- I love it.
- Tasha salad was freaking
hilar.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Jinkx, you're the North Star
in your little group,
because they would've been lost
without you.
Looking like Glenn Close
in<i> Fatal Attraction</i>
for a kids' show?
I mean, that in itself
is completely demented.
- Coco Montrese.
- This was not your challenge.
I can't really tell you why.
- They wanted me
to be a marionette,
and I was just supposed
to answer the question.
And that's not me.
In the show in Vegas, I am the--
I'm the front. I'm the star.
- If you are good
at being in the spotlight,
you should know how to steal it.
- There's been a lot on my mind.
- What's on your mind?
- [tearful]
Alyssa's my friend.
We didn't talk for two years.
And...
Coming here and seeing her here
completely threw me off.
And I don't feel like
I'm showing you who--
who I really am,
'cause I'm better than that.
- I know there's distractions,
but, Coco, keep your head
in the game
and be Coco.
All right, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Okay, just between us "goyls,"
what do you think?
Starting with Roxxxy Andrews.
- She's absolutely a stunner.
The hair color.
J.Lo wishes.
- Yes.
What did you think of her
performance as Tasha Salad?
- There is nothing
more attractive
than seeing a beautiful woman
dare to be ugly.
- Uh-huh.
- I expect some good stuff
out of that one.
- Next up, Alaska.
Now, Michelle, you and I
both looked at each other
when Alaska came out
dressed as a man...
- Mm-hmm.
- And thought, "What the F?"
- It really was
just Pee-wee Herman.
- Yeah, that's true.
- And this is
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>
- Okay.
- Alaska, to me,
he doesn't stand out.
He's, like, someone I would
hang out with in high school.
- What high school
did you go to?
- Well, I mean, I was
a homeschooler, but, um...
[laughter]
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Who was she again?
- She played Fanny
the farm hand--sunglasses.
- Oh, well, see,
that's how memorable she was.
- Well, there you go.
- She was such a nervous wreck.
You can never let them
see you sweat.
- She's stopping herself.
- Exactly, the calls are coming
from inside the house.
Vivienne Pinay.
- Anita Bum was forgettable.
- Right,
'cause if she was Anita Bum,
she could've been really hyper,
like, you know, um, yeah, um--
She could've gone for it,
you know?
- When I see a Plain Jane,
kind of like her--
'cause she is boring--
I like to do them up.
- Turn her out.
- Turn her out!
That's what I love to do.
- Detox.
- Kids would love watching
Clucky the cock.
- I see Faye Dunaway had a child
with Anjelica Huston,
and then she lost
all her fashion sense
and started wearing clothes
with holes in them.
- Yes.
- Sorry, Coco.
[laughter]
- Jinkxy Monsoon.
- She got me in the mood.
Like, I was singing with her.
I was raising my hands.
- Oh, right.
- I was a little girl.
- She was the only reason
that team stayed afloat.
- Coco Montrese.
- She had an issue with,
you know,
not getting the right part,
but you have to take lemons
and make lemonade.
- Blaming your shortcomings
on somebody else?
- Mm-hmm.
- Please.
- And you know, Santino,
playing the dummy can be
a real scene-stealing role,
right, Michelle?
[laughter]
I mean--
- [guffawing]
- You know I love you, and I
only say it 'cause it's true.
- Yeah.
- I was just telling everybody
how much nicer
you were than Tyra.
[laughter]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
[whispers] My girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews,
your portrayal
of Tasha Salad was,
in a word,
[lisping] sensational.
You are safe.
Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
Your kidster character
was not after-school special.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
Detox, your Clucky the cock...
bl-bl-bl-blocked...

Much more.
Vivienne...

Coco Montrese,

Shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Monica,
you came here with a secret.
And the secret is
you are fierce and talented.
Go share that with the world.
- [crying] Thank you
for believing in me.
Thank you for seeing something
in me that I never saw.
[sniffles]
- Thank you.
- I love you.
Thank you so much.
- We love you.
Now sashay away.
- I had a hard time
opening up to the girls.
I've always had that problem.
It did hold me back
in this competition.
But I am fierce.
And I need to just step back
and be okay with that.
- 11 queens, 1 crown.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play!

- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
To make it in RuPaulywood,
you've gotta dive in
the deep end.
- Agh!
I can't do it.
I fail.
- Welcome to the slums of
Beverly Hills.
- Aah! Mommy!
- Ow! That's my leg.
You know, I have a feeling
you just like to be
the only pretty one.

We're back in the workroom
after Penny was just eliminated,
and it's really hard 'cause
I'm really gonna miss her.
- All right, Penny,
here we go.
Bye-bye.
- All: Bye, Penny.
- I happen to have stumbled.
And that's okay.
I know that destiny
wanted the queens to see
how good of a performer I am.
Maybe that's what I needed for
the queens to really respect me.
- Well, I already thought
I was gonna be on the bottom.
It scared the shit out of me,
and I realized looking
at you guys competing,
I was like, "You know what?
That could've been me."
I just feel like
I'm different
from the rest of these girls,
you know.
My head, mentally, it's, like,
somewhere else.
- There was something
about Monica
at Penny's elimination.
She just wasn't happy
that we were safe.
- I thought Penny was revving up
for it at the beginning.
I was like, "Watch out, girl."
- Aw, does that mean you guys
were rooting for me?
Were any of you guys
wishing I went home?
- I love Penny.
And Penny and I have gotten c--
you know what I'm saying?
And I'm not trying to be a bitch
or anything,
but you've kind of gotten on
my nerves a little bit so far.
I'm upset because I really would
rather see Serena go home.
- Serena has annoyed me
to the point where
I can't say anything nice
about her.
I'm just gonna try my best
to avoid Serena,
and if she's gonna
get in my way,
I'm just gonna smack her
like a fly over a cow patty.
Just go home, bitch.

Detox looks like the Joker.

[cheers and applause]
Nice lip jobs, ladies.
But consider that
just a warm-up.
For this week's main challenge,
it's gonna be a lip-synch
extravaganza.
[queens cheer]
You'll be taking classic moments
from the herstory of<i> Drag Race</i>
and recreating them
in your own scene-stealing
viral videos.
You'll be lip-synching
to the spoken word, darling.
I'm Laura Linney, and this is
<i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>
[laughter]
Serena Chacha, Detox,
and Ivy Winters,
you're team captains.
Serena, you choose first.
- Ms. Roxxxy Andrews.
- I want my Lasky.
- [laughs]
- Toxy!
- Lasky!
- Ms. Lineysha.
[laughter]
- Ms. Alyssa, come here, baby.
- Give me Monica.
- Ms. Vivienne.
- Ms. Jinkx,
come here, baby.
- Coco Montrese,
get your ass over here,
bitch.
- Ivy Winters,
take your pick.
I'm sorry, Jade, but I'm gonna
have to go with Honey.
- That's okay, girl.
- And that means Jade Jolie
goes with Serena Chacha.
- I'm not exactly, like,
the person
that would normally
be picked last.
That kind of pissed me off.
- Yay!
Welcome to our... team...
- Ladies, I need your lip syncs
to be as tight
and unforgettable
as your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Our team gets an envelope,
and we are gonna be lip-synching
to a video of past seasons
of<i> Untucked.</i>
And we are doing season three's
Raja and Delta
and then the scene with
Shangela, Mimi, and Mariah.
Shangela.
- Shangela.
- Mariah.
Somebody has to be Mimi.
- I think you should be Mimi.
- I think I should be Raja.
- I think you're Raja,
hands down.
- Yeah, I'll do Mimi.
- Okay, guys, so let's just
finalize this.
We have Raja, we have Delta,
we have Shangela--
- I'm Delta?
I was pretty much ignored.
I kind of got dealt with
what was left.
If our team is in the bottom,
I am gonna throw Serena right
into the freaking pit.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Jade, did you choose
to be Delta?
- Do it again.
- Can I have a second?
- Oh, but you want to
really fight.
- [screams]
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- So Ru tells us that
we will be reenacting scenes
from<i> Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> from seasons</i>
two, three, and four.
- Aah!
- Season four.
- Season four.
- So we have
Ms. Lashauwn Beyond,
Jiggly Caliente,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and my boyfriend,
Sharon Needles.
- We're Sharon and Phi Phi!
I call Phi Phi.
- No!
- I call Phi Phi.
- Okay, I'll be Sharon.
- I'll be the--Jiggly.
- You wanna do Jiggly?
And you'll be Lashauwn?
- Here we go.
- Phi Phi, I was not trying
to throw you under the bus.
- Girl, what you do best
is you act.
- Can you please
put a wonky eyelash on?
That's all I ask.
- Yes.
- This is gonna be sick, girl.
Anybody have any orange paint?
I know Phi Phi personally,
and I think she's
a lovely person,
but I'm taking this exaggeration
to the nth degree.
- [laughing]
Whoo!
- My foundation
is sickeningly dark,
and one of my lashes is gluing
one of my eyes shut.
That might be a little too dark.
- Um, Lineysha,
why don't you play Tyra?
- Tyra Sanchez.
I am doing season two.
We've got Morgan McMichaels,
Mystique, Tyra,
and Tatianna.
- There isn't anything else
to say.
- But why are you talking?
- Why are<i> you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talking?</i>
- Because if I have a problem
with someone
or I have something to say to
someone, I say it to them.
If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- Quite honestly,
I think Lineysha
is going to struggle
the most because of
the language barrier.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello, Ru.
- Hi.
- Team Serena Chacha.
- Hola, hola, hola.
- Serena, you're playing...
- Raja.
- Raja.
- Yes.
- Did you assign the roles
for each person?
- We did it evenly.
- Jade, who are you playing?
- I'm Delta.
- Did you choose to be Delta?
- No, I was kind of, um,
a team player and just
gonna work it out.
- Okay.
So Jinkx is Mimi Imfurst.
What about you, Roxxxy?
Who are you playing?
- I'm doing Mariah.
- Mariah, of course.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you're playing?
- Shangela Halleloo.
I put her in drag
for her very first time.
- You did?
- Yes.
- A family that drags
together...
- All: Stays together.
- As you well know,
one of the best queens who's
ever used spoken word
in lip sync is Lypsinka.
- Yep.
- She is famous
for using dialogue
from Joan Crawford
and Bette Davis films.
Absolutely the best.
So now, are you kids gonna
give me just a taste?
- Are you, like,
curious at all
as to why Stacy didn't, like,
immediately pick you?
- I smell fear in her,
and I tend to kind of--
not pick on her, but I'm just
very, like, hard on her.
- So you're reading
off the thing.
You haven't memorized it yet.
And you haven't done any
characterization yet of Raja.
[dramatic music]
- Um, well, she doesn't really
move very much.
- She would still
have character.
Bring it up.
- Bring it up. I can do it.
I can do it. I can do it.
- Y'all make it work, okay?
See you later. All right.
- Thank you.
- Just make up a character,
honey.
Make up a something.
- Team Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, I know you're doing
season four.
Who's playing Sharon?
Who's playing Phi Phi?
- Phi phi.
- Duh.
- You're Phi Phi?
[laughs]
And you're Sharon?
- Yeah.
- It's interesting.
You live with Sharon.
Why didn't you play Sharon?
- I do Sharon all the time.
- Yeah.
- [laughs]
Now, who are you two?
- Ms. Jiggly Caliente.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- I'm Lashauwn Beyond.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Yes.
- What is the key to doing this?
Have you ever done spoken word?
- Not that much.
- What's the biggest challenge
with this scene?
- Honest, just listening to
Phi Phi's voice over and over.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.
- All right, Ru.
- And make it special.
- Okay.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi, Ru.
- So you're doing season two.
- Yes.
- And who are you playing?
- I'm playing Morgan.
- And who are you playing?
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna, of course.
- Yes.
- And you are?
- Mystique Summers.
- Mystique Summers Madison.
I wanted to call her
Mystique Summers eve.
But she wasn't having it.
Okay, who are you?
- Tyra Sanchez.
- You're the other, other Tyra.
Can we hear a little bit
of Tyra and Tatianna?
- Sure.
- Tapped me on the shoulder.
- I tapped you on the elbow
first.
- If it bothered anyone,
if they would have just said,
"Could you keep it down?
It's bothering me,"
that had would've been fine.
- And I did that.
- If someone comes to you...
- [laughs]
- And saying you're obnoxious--
- I'm watching you lip-synch.
- Ah, okay.
- That's not how I started it,
though.
I tapped you on the shoulder.
First I-I said your name
across the room.
- Okay, well, you got a lot
of work to do.
Get at it.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, see ya.
- Mwah.
- All right, dolls.
Now, I warned you this is gonna
be a lip-synch extravaganza.
Read my lips.
[silent]
[laughter and applause]
- Queens: Bye.
- Bye, Ru.
[hip-hop music]
- Oh.
My train, girl, my train.
Our challenge this week
is to lip-synch
to a past scene from<i> Untucked.</i>
Where do you want me to be?
- Mimi over here, then.
- My team had to do scenes from
season three.
It's Shangela, Mimi Imfurst,
and Mariah.
- Boo, just 'cause you got
a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey.
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay, ready?
[beep]
- Boo, just 'cause you got
a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no. No.
- Oh, my gosh. Watch out.
Watch out, watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out, watch out.
Anybody get hurt?
- Graceful.
Do it again. Come on.
Push play.
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- [laughing]
- Do it again.
Do it again.
- Can I have just one second
to get this back on?
- Here.
- Just get it for her fast.
Ready?
Five, four--
- Oh, shit!
- Do it again.
Just roll it up.
- I will never look like that.
- True.
[dramatic music]
- Do it again.
- It is easier for you to say,
"Do it again," okay?
- Hold on.
- Can I have a second?
- Oh, but you want to
really fight.
- It got to the point where
I had to yell and scream
and snap at people
just to be heard in that group.
[choked up]
And this is too important to me
to let them get to me like this.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.
- That would take the lose away.
- Honey, you are already out.
- I'm really starting
to get annoyed.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Our challenge today is
we have to lip-synch
from a past season.
The second scene is with myself
and Serena.
We're playing Delta and Raja.
- Like,
it's like a soccer player
from, like, Paraguay
or something,
mixed with, like, Afghanistan
and<i> Charro.</i>
- I wonder if people
talk about us this way.
- At the end,
when you hear,
"I wonder if they talk about us
this way,"
you turn to us like you just
heard the entire conversation
or whatever.
- Okay.
- Then I'll just pass out.
I come from
an arts school environment,
and I believe that drag
is performing gender
through various skills, like
makeup as a form of painting,
fashion as a form
of self-sculpture,
and showmanship
through performance.
- I wonder if people talk
about us this way.
[coughs]
- Serena playing Raja...
that was really bizarre.
- All right.
How'd you guys feel about that?
I feel good.
[clapping]
How did you guys feel?
- Oh, my God.
We're so gonna be on the bottom
because of you.
- All right, ladies.
- All right.
The first scene that
my team is performing
is a catfight between
Morgan McMichaels
and Mystique Summers
from season two.
- Go fix your hair.
- I don't need some--
- Fix your mug.
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch.
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.
- Sweetie. Sweetie.
- You do need to--
- I don't gotta hit your ass
to probably get voted off,
bitch.
- Hit me. Do it.
- Walk off. Step off, bitch.
- Do it.
- Lineysha's acting crazy.
- Okay, let's do it again.
- We should be working
as a team,
and she's goofing off
and playing around.
- Don't be, like, banging
'cause the argument's
mainly about
what Morgan and Mystique
are saying.
- Hit me.
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.
- That will take the lose away.
- Honey, you are out. Lost.
- That will take the lose away.
- You already lost.
- I think Lineysha wants
all the eyes on her,
and I'm really starting
to get annoyed.
- Ooh.
- I'm playing Tatianna
in a scene where
Tatianna and Tyra are bickering
back and forth.
- If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- And I don't like you.
Are you happy?
I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
- Ugh.
- I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
- [laughs]
Lineysha was the worst person
to work with,
but her performance as Tyra
was awesome.
She was so on point.
Um, she's one
to be reckoned with.
- Okay.
My team has two scenes
to reenact from season four,
one of which is between Phi Phi
O'Hara and Sharon Needles.
- Do you really think I'm upset
that I didn't get a cruise?
- The only thing
you keep saying is,
"I promised Alaska one thing,
"and that was to bring her back
a trip.
[whiny voice]
Why didn't I get a cruise?"
- I will say that
I really wanted a cruise,
but I wanted the $100,000 more.
And look. Guess what.
We got both.
[laughs]
- Do you really think I'm upset
that I didn't get a cruise?
- The only thing
you keep saying is,
"I promised Alaska one thing,
and that was to bring her back
a trip."
- I'm doing an okay job,
but luckily,
Phi Phi does this a lot,
so I can do that
to cover the fact
that I don't know what
she's saying.
- It's bullshit.
- No, you're bullshit.
- [laughs]
- That was a lot better.
- Hell, yeah. That was fun.
- Our second scene is between
Jiggly and Lashauwn.
- I'm not here to make
best buddies, bitch.
This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Of course, I get to be
Lashauwn Beyond,
who has a little bit of problem
with her makeup.
I'm not saying that I do,
'cause I think I'm beautiful.
And then Monica
got to be Jiggly--
after the weight loss.
- If you lacking one thing
somebody else ain't lacking,
then shut the fuck up.
- I didn't say anything about
you going on the runway,
looking like that.
I said nothing about your look.
- Okay, really quick,
Monica,
you're fumbling a little bit
on the lines,
so when you're doing that,
just act up.
Just get nasty with it.
- Okay.
- If you lacking one thing...
- [muttering lines]
- Somebody else ain't lacking,
then shut the fuck up.
- Monica started
to talk her lines,
when we're supposed to be
lip-synching.
It kind of threw me off
a little bit.
I felt like I was just
letting you have it
'cause you didn't throw it back
at me.
Throw it back at me.
- This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Ew.
- I'm like, "Ugh,
I'm fucking it up."
I'm not focused, and I don't
have my 100% in this competition
because I have so much going on
in my head.
- I feel like Monica
gets a little bit nervous,
so I'm hoping that
she shakes out of that.
[dramatic music]
- Rolaskatox is in the building.
- Ding-dong!
- It's always a little tense
on elimination day.
- I do not want to be in
the fucking bottom.
- We won't be in the bottom.
I promise.
- We're sort of looking
around the room
to see who's gonna be on
the chopping block.
- Something's a little different
with Monica.
I'm not sure exactly what it is,
but there's something
on her mind.
You all right?
[sad music]
- I have so much on my mind,
and I don't want to be here.
I'm petrified to tell these
girls my huge secret.
I don't know how they're gonna
take it.
[crying]
It is hard being here.
- Listen, you're here
for a reason.
You could tell inside
she's just breaking down.
I don't think she's all here
at the competition.
[dramatic music]
- [laughing]

- Party girl on her way home.
- Oops, I left my phone inside.
- Coco Montrese.
- This is Patti Labelle
meets Ziggy Stardust.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I love fetish,
so I thought I'd give Santino
a little bit of something to
dream about tonight
while he's at home.
- You better "ass" somebody.
- Damn, girl.
Detox.
- Ohh.
- Snow White and the hunty man.
- Tonight I am wearing
an over-the-top gown
and feeling really sickening.
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?
- [guffaws]
[laughing]
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's take a look
at your viral videos.
First up,
team Serena Chacha.
In the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
Shangela and Mariah
confronted Mimi Imfurst.
- You told them
you could do glamour
and you were high-fashion.
Do you feel that you delivered
that today?
That's the question.
- No, but I don't think
that was the challenge.
- Don't tiptoe
around the answer.
The thing is,
you just told us
that what you do is camp.
- You'll never be glamour.
- Boo, just 'cause
you got a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Ooh!
- I've never had a sugar daddy.
If I wanted a sugar daddy,
yes, I probably could go out
and get one,
because I am what?
Sickening, bitch!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no.
[laughter]
- Meanwhile, in the bar,
Delta gossiped with Raja.
- Manila was just that,
like, amalgamation
of every Asian stereotype.
- She was, like, Chinese,
Japanese,
dirty knees,
look at these.
Remember that?
- Right, like,
she's like a place in France
where the naked ladies dance.
- She was Cambodi-China-no.
- She was, like,
middle-America's interpretation
of Asian people, but when they
call them Oriental.
- [laughs]
I wonder if people talk about us
this way.
[coughs]
- All right.
[applause]
- Watching Serena was like
watching an old Chinese movie.
[silent]
- Next up, team Ivy Winters.
In the gold bar,
Tyra defended her singing,
which infuriated Tatianna.
- I'm not gonna replay it
because I already know
what happened,
and you already know
what happened.
- Okay, well, then--then
there's nothing else to say.
- I'm not replaying it with you
over and over again.
There isn't anything else
to say.
- But why are you talking?
- Why are<i> you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talking?</i>
- Anyway, if you have a problem
with someone, address it.
And that's probably why
I seem like a bitch.
If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- And I don't like you.
Are you happy?
I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
[laughter]
- Back in the lounge,
things were getting heated
between Morgan and Mystique.
- Go fix your hair.
- I don't need to.
- Fix your mug.
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch!
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.
- Sweetie.
- You have no manners.
- How do I have no--no manners?
- No class and no manners.
- No class, no manners?
You piss me off some more,
I will whoop your fucking ass.
Bitch, I am from Chicago.
[laughter and applause]
- I'm actually super confident
that I'm gonna be the winner
of the challenge
because I feel like
I turned it out.
- Next up, team Detox.
In the gold bar,
Jiggly was mad at Lashauwn.
- I'm not here to make
best buddies, bitch!
- Neither am I.
- I'm not here
to be your friend.
Then shut the fuck up!
You been everybody's B.F.F.
and ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki.
No.
- Clearly, I don't get along
with you.
- That's fine.
I don't have to be your friend.
This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Back in the lounge,
Sharon defended herself
for calling Phi Phi O'Hara
cutthroat.
- I wasn't tarnishing your--
- Bullshit.
- I said you were cutthroat
and you hogged that
choreography, which is true.
- Because I'm fucking fierce,
and I'm good at what I do?
- No, you're the one
that fucking lied,
saying I'm just here for a trip.
We all know that's a joke.
- Bullshit.
Every fucking time.
It's bullshit.
- No, you're bullshit.
[laughter and applause]
- Oh, my lord.
- Ladies, you all did
an amazing job.
But one group was more
in synch than the others.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...

<i>Coming up...</i>
- Is that a prosthetic nose?
- You were like Chewbacca
in drag.
- Is this really your best drag?
- [sobbing]
- [laughing]
[laughing]
Ladies, one group was more
in synch than the others.
The winner is...
team Ivy Winters.
- Yay!
[laughs]
Yay.
- But one of you really
lip-smacked the competition...
Lineysha Sparx.
- [laughs]
- Oh.
[applause]
- You've won a couture latex
outfit from Siren Latex,
plus immunity from elimination
next week.
- [laughing]
- You may leave the stage.
- Yes.
- Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.
Alyssa Edwards.
- Your Shangela lip-synching
was--
- Was better than Shangela.
[laughter]
- I do a bit of acting myself
on the side.
But I love
when people transform,
and I didn't recognize you.
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah.
- Serena Chacha.
- What the "F" was with that
little teeny flag?
You come out with this ginormous
thing and, like,
♪ Do do-do do-do do-do ♪
- The panties are almost<i> abuela,</i>
grandma panties.
And the lip-synching
was completely off.
- It was just kind of
uncomfortable to watch too.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Mariah--it was a
great lip-synch,
and you gave it
over-the-top Mariah-isms.
- With all the fringe
hanging down and the color,
I thought that you were like
Chewbacca in drag.
- [gasps]
- Shut up, Santino,
because that's perfection.
- [laughs]
- Come on.
- All right, Jinkx Monsoon.
- The hair was a little thirsty.
- I tried to tease it,
but I just pissed it off,
I know.
- [guffaws]
- Yeah, it's that--
- Your Mimi--I couldn't
take my eyes off you.
You're bananas,
and I love it.
- Jade Jolie.
- Your Delta--work!--
was hilar.
- Thank you.
- You should've practiced
with that whip, though,
a little bit more.
If you're gonna walk
with a whip,
you better crack that shit.
Am I allowed to say whip?
- [laughs]
- Just kidding.
- [laughs]
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Jiggly's probably
one of the biggest characters,
and you let that
completely go away.
- Also, on your runway as well,
I don't know, maybe you're sad
today or it's a hard day.
You're kind of disconnected.
- Monica, tell me.
What's on your mind?
- It's true,
what you're saying.
There is a lot
going through my head.
I feel I'm not here.
[crying]
I've just been
holding a secret in
and trying so hard, and--
- What secret?

- I'm not just a drag queen.

Ever since I got here,
I've been lying to myself

[sobbing]

I feel like I'm not
being myself.
Every day is hard.
- I invited you here
because you are fierce.
You deserve to be here,
and that's why you're here.
You have to believe in yourself,
and the only person
who does not believe is you.
Stay strong,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I will.
- I think she's here now.
- I think you're here too.
- It felt good to say that.
- Monica has been through
everything.
Right now, she's my hero.
She's the strongest girl
in this competition.
- All right.
Alaska, the 49th state.

- Is this really your best drag?
- This is actually Detox's

Coco Montrese.
- I think everything

- If it ever comes down
to lip-synching against Coco,
I fear for each and every
one of you

- Thank you so much.
- ♪ Detox ♪
- Your Sharon Needles scared me.
- [laughing]
- And that's hard.
- You've been around
a little bit,
I can tell, right?
- Oh, what are you
trying to say?
- Been there, done that.
Just a little vibe of that
coming from you.
Just loosen up a little bit
on everything.
- It's a shock to hear
that I'm overconfident.
This is something that I've been
wanting to do for years,
and to finally be here,
I'm humbled.
- Well, my queens,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine revs]
All right, now,
just between us "goyls"...
Alyssa Edwards.
- She revealed
this whole other talent
with the lip-synching.
- I love her mouth so much.
It's very hard for me
to take everything else in.
I get hypnotized.
- All right, Serena Chacha.
- I have a special place
in my heart for Raja,
and she got nothing right.
Don't swim in the big pond
until you got your little
floaties on, girlfriend.
- I see improvement.
Is it enough improvement?
I'm not sure.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Her performance as Mariah,
it was spot-on.
- Yeah.
- But I don't want to see boobs.
I mean--
- Why are you sitting
next to Michelle, then?
- I don't want to see boobs
when I'm at<i> Drag Race.</i>
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- This is not meant
to be offensive,
but is that a prosthetic nose
tonight?
- No, that is her real nose.
- Oh, my God.
- So do you think that,
the way she shaded it,
it looked almost
Alice the Goon-ish?
- Yeah.
- That said,
she's certainly the best actress
up there.
I mean, she's phenomenal.
- Jade Jolie.
- Had it not been for
her portrayal of Delta,
that whole thing would've been
unwatchable.
- I'm a little bored.
You know, come on.
Fat suit, funny.
- Monica Beverly Hillz,
who confessed to us
that she actually is
in the middle of transitioning.
- Good for her.
I think she looks great.
She's gonna have a great life.
- But she didn't embody
any Jiggly.
She could've gone all the way
and blacked out some teeth.
- Yes!
You could've even done
her expression,
you know, that, like--
- [guffaws]
- I don't see the performer.
- Alaska.
- Her Phi Phi was fantastic.
- I actually think her
performance really failed.
I thought it was over the top
in not a funny way.
- Coco Montrese.
- She is such a badass.
The lip-synching she had down
to a tee.
- Her Lashauwn was beyond
Lashauwn.
- Detox.
- Flawless and beautiful.
- It just didn't do it for me.
She didn't do it for me.
She kind of feels like
she's figured it all out.
You love her.
We get it.
- No, I love all of them.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
- Thank God.
- [mumbles incoherently]
- [laughs]
- [laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your performances
in this week's challenge
and on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
[suspenseful music]
Monica Beverly Hillz,
please step forward.
Serena Chacha.
Monica,
your performance this week
was a little too Jiggly
and not enough caliente.
And, Serena,
as team leader,
you forgot to cover
your own ass.
I'm sorry, my dears, but you are
both up for elimination.
The rest of you...
may join the other girls.
- It was no surprise to me
that I was gonna be
on the bottom two.
[sighs] I should've said
something earlier.
- Bottom two again.
Fuck my life.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me,
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
to lip-synch...
for your life.
- Sorry, Serena.
I'm gonna lip-synch
for my motherfucking life.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

all: What?
&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
&gt;&gt; Now,
in my illustrious career,
I've had to put on my makeup
without a mirror
or during a power blackout.
So for today's mini-challenge,
you have to apply your makeup
in total darkness.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; I am losing confidence
in myself doing makeup
in the light.

The winner is...
Detox.
Face, face.
Ladies, it's always darkest
before the dawn,
and now it's time to share
your light with the world.
Now back in the '80s,
music's biggest superstars
formed super-groups,
like "Band Aid"
and "USA for Africa."
They lifted spirits
and raised money.
So for today's main challenge,
you'll be writing and recording
the newest inspirational anthem.
Can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
&gt;&gt; No, I mean, actually
that's the name of the song:
<i>Can I Get an Amen?</i>
[laughter]
Yeah.
Now, you'll be writing lyrics
in three teams.
Detox, since you won
the mini-challenge,
you get to decide the teams.
[laughter]
So who's your first
team of three?
Alaska and Roxxxy,
get your asses over here.
&gt;&gt; Rolaskatox formation.
&gt;&gt; Formation.
[laughs]
Okay, and I think
that the rest of the groups
are already
paired together...
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; The way that I want them.
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh.
&gt;&gt; So we have Jade, Ivy,
and Jinkx.
And we've got Coco and Alyssa.
&gt;&gt; You are a shady bitch.
Me and Alyssa had a very heated
argument,
and these girls know that.
&gt;&gt; I'm a little thrown.
Once again, here we go.
&gt;&gt; You can see
the storm clouds gathering.
[imitates cat hissing, snarling]
&gt;&gt; All right, ladies.
Later, you'll be recording with
my producer, Lucian Piane.
[cheers and applause]
&gt;&gt; And the dress code?

start your engines.
And may the best woman win.

when I give her a team,
then show me what you can do
with this fucking first verse.
Have at it.
Okay, so Alyssa and Coco,
you guys are gonna do verse one.
Jinkx, Jade, and Ivy,
you guys are gonna do verse two.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then, Rolaskatox,
we're gonna be doing the bridge.
Listen to this a few times
and get to work.
That's all.
&gt;&gt; "You guys are
the first verse."
Which means we'll be
the first take.
I'm so over these girls.
I'm done.
&gt;&gt; What's the "T"?
&gt;&gt; I don't need y'all
to gang up on me.
You, you, or you.
&gt;&gt; I wasn't instigating shit.
&gt;&gt; [giggles]
[laughs]
&gt;&gt; The challenge for this week
is to write lyrics
to a "save the world"-inspired
drag anthem.
We have to have an '80s look
put together,
and we have to perform the song
in front of Lucian.
It's a doozy.
I'm gonna alter
some of these words.

&gt;&gt; All right.
Coco and Alyssa.
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.
&gt;&gt; Cocolyssa.
Now, who sings?
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try to take it to
church a little bit.
&gt;&gt; All right, what about you,
Alyssa?
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to take it to church.
I may take it down the street
to the Jack in the Box.

&gt;&gt; Alyssa in
a dancing challenge,
she's bringing home the trophy.
Alyssa in a singing challenge...
she ain't bringing home shit.
&gt;&gt; Now how is this gonna
inspire people
in the context of your song?
&gt;&gt; We did ours kind of towards
straight people, you know?
&gt;&gt; Oh.
both: "Lost and confused.
"I had to smile deep within.
When I realized
these women were men."
&gt;&gt; Um, look at those
lyrics again
and put some fun in there.
All right, kids,
you get back to work.
I cannot wait to hear
the finished product.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Ivy, Jade, and Jinkx.
[overlapping greetings]
&gt;&gt; It's like Wilson Phillips is
back together.
Now, who sings in the group?
&gt;&gt; I grew up singing, doing,
like, classical music.
I was classically trained.
&gt;&gt; I sing professionally,
actually.
&gt;&gt; What about you, Jade?
&gt;&gt; I sing in the car.
I think I'm just gonna have to
freestyle it and just...
&gt;&gt; Well, this is a competition.
You know, you got to plan
something out.
&gt;&gt; Jade?
She's just kind of floating by.
&gt;&gt; Jinkx, you and Michelle
aren't coming together
on a style angle.
What do you think that's about?
&gt;&gt; I think we used the word
"glamour" in different ways.
But I think this next runway,
I'm going to get right on there.
&gt;&gt; There's a lot
of show-stopping queens
around here.
You need to steal the spotlight.
All right, get back to work,
and I cannot wait to see you.
&gt;&gt; [sighs]
&gt;&gt; Rolaskatox.
&gt;&gt; What's going on?
&gt;&gt; Hey.
You're doing the bridge
and the last chorus.
What message have you
all written?

&gt;&gt; Now, you're gonna make this

All right,

and we'll see you out there.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ru.
&gt;&gt; All right.
All right, ladies,
gather around, my children.
Tomorrow, on the main stage,
we will debut your
<i>Can I Get an Amen?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
music video.
And our extra-special guest
judges will be
three amazing women
who appeared on the original
<i>We are the World:</i>
Anita and Ruth,
the Pointer Sisters.
[cheers and applause]
And La Toya Jackson
will be here.
&gt;&gt; La Toya!
&gt;&gt; Oh, my god.
So excited to have them here
when I know I'm
on top of my game.
&gt;&gt; And for the runway, I want
you to put together a look
that shows off
your favorite body part.
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; 'Cause, honey, if you can't
love your body part,
how in the hell you gonna--
well, you get
the picture.
Just don't fuck it up.
Okay?
All right.
I'll see you later.
&gt;&gt; Coco, there's a lot of
pressure on you
to start this out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
It's great.
Thanks, Detox.
&gt;&gt; For what?
&gt;&gt; [giggles]
[laughs]
&gt;&gt; Ooh.
&gt;&gt; Amen.
&gt;&gt; The main challenge
for this week
is to record a song about
how drag can save people's lives
and change the world.
&gt;&gt; Hello, ladies.
all: Hi.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
We're recording the track,
and we're recording
a live video.
Coco, there's a lot of pressure
on you to start this out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; It's great.
Thanks, Detox.
&gt;&gt; What, honey?
&gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you."
&gt;&gt; For what?
&gt;&gt; Nothing.
Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Is something wrong?
&gt;&gt; No. Not at all.
&gt;&gt; Well, apparently there is.
What's going on?
&gt;&gt; We're ready.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm pissed off.
I'm the first one up.
I'm nervous as hell.
&gt;&gt; Cue track.

they were on different planes.

&gt;&gt; Why are you looking down

&gt;&gt; Sorry.

&gt;&gt; I feel that Jinkx
is the weakest
because all these girls

pissing me off.

&gt;&gt; Are you saying "sequin" or--
&gt;&gt; Sequinsed dress.
&gt;&gt; "Sequin dress," I think is
what you mean.
&gt;&gt; I say "sequinsed dress."
"Sequinsed" is more than one
sequins.
A "sequins" is one little
circle shiny little sequins.
Is it wrong English?
Sequin?
A sequin is one.
Sequins is plural?
Sequinsed.

Both of you are doing what,
right there?
&gt;&gt; The second part.
&gt;&gt; No, are you crazy?
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; You guys changed keys
before the song changes keys.
Just--ugh--a train wreck.
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Detox and Roxxxy
are joking around too much,
not taking it seriously.
That's unacceptable.
&gt;&gt; So now it's time to do
some freestyling
over the choruses, ladies.
Do whatever you think works.

&gt;&gt; Ah!
&gt;&gt; Whoo!
&gt;&gt; "Love yourself."
&gt;&gt; That was so much fun.
&gt;&gt; Girl, I thought you was about
to go off.
&gt;&gt; No, girl.
&gt;&gt; Do you feel like
she was instigating it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And then try to play like,
"Oh, I didn't do anything."
&gt;&gt; What's the "T"?
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.
I'm totally fine.
&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking if
you're gonna say my name,
you've been throwing
dust and shade.
&gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you."
All I said was,
"Thank you, Detox."
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for
what though, miss thing?
&gt;&gt; Well, she feels like
you were instigating.
&gt;&gt; I wasn't instigating shit.
I'm not trying to be dusty.
I'm not trying to sabotage
anybody in this competition.
If you feel that way,
I'm sorry you feel that way,
'cause that's not the case.
&gt;&gt; I'm giving dust,
I'm giving this.
I ain't said a word.
I'm just standing here.
&gt;&gt; You haven't said a word,
but you said a lot to Alyssa
this whole--
&gt;&gt; I don't need y'all
to gang up on me.
You, you, or you.
&gt;&gt; Miss thing, I'm not ganging
up on anybody.
&gt;&gt; I don't need that.
&gt;&gt; I'm not ganging up
on anybody.
&gt;&gt; I said what I had to say.
&gt;&gt; When you're on stage
and you say,
"Thank you, detox,"
snotty like that--
when I see this and I see
eyeballs flying at me,
I'm gonna fucking say something.
&gt;&gt; Girl, I didn't even
look at you.
Who eyeballs were flying at you?
'Cause my eyeballs
didn't fly nowhere.
&gt;&gt; Coco always wants to say
that she's very positive
and looks at the best
of everything.
&gt;&gt; Oh, my god.
&gt;&gt; Yet she's been
playing the victim
the last couple of weeks,
and I'm just
pretty much over it.
&gt;&gt; Ro!
&gt;&gt; Laska!
&gt;&gt; Tox!
&gt;&gt; ♪ Elimination day ♪
&gt;&gt; The theme for today's runway
is "best body part."
It's imperative for me to burn
the building with the look,
because Coco wasn't herself,
I'm not a singer,
and I didn't come to
this competition
to be in the bottom three.
&gt;&gt; What are you featuring today?
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna show off
my whole body.
I've had so much done
to my body,
I might as well show it off.
&gt;&gt; What all have you had done?
&gt;&gt; I have had a little bit
of plastic surgery
here and there.
I've had my hips
and my ass done.
I've had my pecs done.
Underneath my eyes done
and my brow area done.
My six-pack done.
&gt;&gt; You've had a six-pack done
with silicone?
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
My cheeks done and my lips done.
My chin done,
and my jawline done.
My shoulders, I've had--
&gt;&gt; Your shoulders?
&gt;&gt; My muscles are all silicone.
And then I've had a little bit
done on my bicep here.
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
You're a silicone maniac.
&gt;&gt; The only thing I haven't
had done
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.
I'm like walking tupperware,
girl.
I'm part of the Glad family
of products.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; How do I feel about queens
who've had plastic surgery?
Jealous.
If I had my way,
my upper lip would
look like this.
&gt;&gt; It wasn't
the most pleasant experience
for coming out for me.
[laughs]
&gt;&gt; Did you have anyone
in your family
who was supportive of you?
&gt;&gt; It really, like, ruined
my world for a while.
I had, like, really
dark times as a kid.
I parted from my family.
We parted on bad terms,
and I really just
didn't have anyone.
I didn't have any friends.
I didn't have anybody.
I was just very lost.
And I wasn't happy with myself.
&gt;&gt; You don't need to waste time
trying to impress the people
who aren't gonna accept you
for who you are.
&gt;&gt; Right.
And I think when you get older,
you just really appreciate
things so much more.
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm glad that--you
know, I don't regret anything.
I pride myself on
where I'm at now
and the person that I've become.
I'm much stronger,
and I love myself much more.
You know, when Ru says,
"You have to love yourself",
you definitely do, so...
'cause if you don't love
yourself,
how the hell are you gonna love
anyone else?
[laughs]
&gt;&gt; I thought that Detox
was trying to be
a little malicious
when she put us together.

Ooh.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Commence shakedown.
First up, Coco Montrese.
It takes a lot of guts to wear
that outfit.
&gt;&gt; I'm giving them a Coco
they've never seen.
I'm showing off my heart.
&gt;&gt; She's got a "heart on"

&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying.
Take that, Honey Mahogany.
&gt;&gt; Jade Jolie, rainbow bright.
&gt;&gt; I'm featuring my arms.
I try not to carry over
5 pounds,
so I'm very proud to have
the petite arms that I have.
&gt;&gt; She forgot to shave.

&gt;&gt; Ivy Winters.
&gt;&gt; Ivy's a real pinup.
&gt;&gt; I decided to make a dress
completely out of paper,
pictures of my face.
[laughs]
&gt;&gt; I love that dress!
Just don't get near
the shredder.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Or an open flame.
&gt;&gt; Jinkx Monsoon.
&gt;&gt; It reminds me of
the really old Hollywood movies.
The glamour movies.
&gt;&gt; My look tonight
is rich, white bitch.
And my attitude tonight
is so over it.

Roxxxy Andrews.
&gt;&gt; Bam!
&gt;&gt; Oh, hey!

Yes.
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques.
&gt;&gt; How do you tuck your junk?
[both laugh]
&gt;&gt; No!
Worry about you!
&gt;&gt; [giggles]
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
Ladies, this week
you worked as teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
individually.
Starting with Coco Montrese.
&gt;&gt; I was a little confused
with the top.
I wasn't sure what it was
showing me.
&gt;&gt; Coco, we lost you
in that number.
&gt;&gt; I know that the two of you
have had your differences
in the past.
What was it like working
together as a group?
&gt;&gt; I thought that Detox
was trying to be
a little malicious
when she put us together.
&gt;&gt; Truly, I was not.
I just think that you got
in your head
a little bit too much
yesterday.
&gt;&gt; Coco, you have to stay
grounded in your own foundation.
All right.
Alyssa Edwards.
&gt;&gt; You are absolutely gorgeous.
Your singing...
[laughs]
That's kind of a bit different.
[both laugh]
&gt;&gt; It's clear you do not sing,
but that did not stop you.
You were very funny
and still in it.
&gt;&gt; Next up, Jade Jolie.
&gt;&gt; The singing, it was a little
bit of a let down.
&gt;&gt; It was almost as if you were
dying for this song to get over.
&gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on
here,
hair coming out of the hips,
hair coming out of a boob.
What?
&gt;&gt; Next up, Ivy Winters.
&gt;&gt; Hi, mama.
&gt;&gt; I love your dress.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Are those your pictures
on there?
&gt;&gt; They're all my face,
body shots.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that is so clever.
&gt;&gt; You can carry a tune as well.
I liked your harmonies the best.
You stood out.
&gt;&gt; Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
&gt;&gt; I love the way you held that
long note.
That just put all the icing
on the cake for me.
&gt;&gt; Look, I'm gonna give you
a tip.
You don't need to contour
so hard.
Though we have
a touch of crazy in us,
you don't need to
look it.
&gt;&gt; Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.
One question.
Is that your skin color?
Is that all painted on?
&gt;&gt; That's peanut butter.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Peanut butter.
&gt;&gt; Peanut butter, peanut butter.
&gt;&gt; It was so hot from the moment
you stepped out there.
And when you threw that
cape off, it was on, honey.
&gt;&gt; In the video, as a group,
it was rough, because
no one was harmonizing
and it got
a little monotonous.
&gt;&gt; What's going on with you
and Detox?
&gt;&gt; Rolaskatox.
&gt;&gt; You got this little sisterly
thing going on?
&gt;&gt; We're just becoming
best of friends,
and Alaska as well.
&gt;&gt; Remember, this is
a competition.
Cliques can be dangerous.
&gt;&gt; All right, next up, Detox.
&gt;&gt; Stunning shape tonight,
and a real payoff
when you turned around.
&gt;&gt; I get worried about you
relying on crutches.
Last week you lip synched for
your life,
and you did
your little jaw thing,
and it's funny.
Let's not kill it.
&gt;&gt; All right.
Who's gonna ask her?
Al-as-ka!
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; I loved the lyric
when you said,
I think it was,
"tuck my junk"?
Yeah, I--
How do you tuck your junk?
&gt;&gt; After the show,
I can show you.
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; I'm almost getting bored.
Something's missing, Alaska.
In your singing performance,
you were hiding behind glasses,
almost so we don't
get to see you.
I don't know why
you're holding back.
Don't worry about your group,
whoever you're with.
No!
Worry about you!
We want to see what Alaska has.
Bring it.
&gt;&gt; I get a sense that you hide
behind shticky character.
There's a level of vulnerability
that you're not allowing us
to see.
You are in a relationship with
Sharon Needles,
and she's got the shtick,
but there is a heart there.
And I want to get to the heart
of Alaska.
Are you hearing any of that?
&gt;&gt; I'm...
um, I need to show you
the real me
and--and show that
to you every time.
To hear that I don't have
a heart,
and I don't have vulnerability,
that's extremely hard
for me to hear.
&gt;&gt; All right, ladies,
while you untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Just between us siblings,
what do you think?
Let's start with Coco Montrese.
&gt;&gt; Child, that highlighter
was higher and lighter
than I've seen in many a time.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I don't think she's focused,
and that's her problem.
The stronger people are gonna
take over
and win at the end of the day,
and that's what's happening
right here.
&gt;&gt; Alyssa Edwards.
&gt;&gt; I loved her look tonight.
She was showcasing legs
and face.
&gt;&gt; She does that walk.
Every time she goes somewhere,
she points to the...
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Spot she's gonna go to.
&gt;&gt; "I'm going over here."
"Now I'm going over here."
"Back here."
&gt;&gt; I love it.
&gt;&gt; Her singing was
a little off balance.
&gt;&gt; She's not a great singer.
Don't judge me!
Don't judge me!
&gt;&gt; But I think she compensated
for that with her movement.
&gt;&gt; Let's move on to Jade Jolie.
Oh, my goodness, that outfit.
&gt;&gt; It just was a miss
on so many levels.
I don't even know
where to begin.
&gt;&gt; I don't really remember
her vocals.
I guess I wasn't impressed.
&gt;&gt; Forgettable.
Just forgettable.
&gt;&gt; Moving on to Ivy Winters.
&gt;&gt; Tonight, on the runway,
was very creative.
&gt;&gt; I like when she added
the harmony to the song.
I thought that was very good.
&gt;&gt; The girl can sing.
She really surprised me.
&gt;&gt; Jinkx Monsoon.
&gt;&gt; There was, like, 20 different
eras going on tonight
in this glamour.
The belt was from the '80s,
the dress was, like, the '50s.
There are so many things
that are consistently a mess.
&gt;&gt; But she can sing.
Jinkx has some pipes.
&gt;&gt; Very strong and powerful.
Liked it very much.
&gt;&gt; Roxxxy Andrews.
&gt;&gt; When it comes to sexy,
she was the top for me.
&gt;&gt; She could not sing a lick,
and that did not stop her.
She was hilarious.
&gt;&gt; Moving on to Detox.
&gt;&gt; She kind of phoned it in
in the song department.
&gt;&gt; Can't remember
the performance.
The dress just
took my mind away.
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Crack is back,
and that was that.
&gt;&gt; Alaska.
&gt;&gt; Every time
she comes out here,
she's got the same
little wiggle,
the same little, "Hi."
I'm bored.
&gt;&gt; I think, truthfully,
that she's given us all she has.
Michelle, this is probably it.
Remember,
we're paring everybody off,
and the competition's getting
really strict and hard now.
&gt;&gt; Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls,
and, uh, can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
&gt;&gt; All right.

Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
This week's winner is...
Ivy Winters.
[applause]
You've won a Flight 001 package.
Luggage for the queen on the go.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
I'm so excited that I won
this challenge,
and I proved to the judges
that I am here for a reason.
&gt;&gt; Jinkx Monsoon, you're safe.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Roxxxy Andrews.
You are safe.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Detox.
You're safe.
But--
and it's a big butt--
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; We expect more from you.
You may join the other girls.
Alaska, you've been coasting
on kooky,
and we want you to go deeper.
You're safe.
Coco Montrese,
this week you wore your heart
on your sleeve
but your mind got
the better of you.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alyssa Edwards, your singing
proved you are...
an amazing dancer.
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Jade Jolie, you light up
our lives,
but this week, you let the other
queens outshine you.
Jade Jolie,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alyssa Edwards, you are safe.
You may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance of
<i>I'm So Excited</i>
by the legendary
Pointer Sisters.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
&gt;&gt; Everything that I didn't give
in that video,
I have to pull it
and give it right now
'cause this is my last chance.
&gt;&gt; Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
We're throwing the first ever
Sugar Ball.
[all gasp]
Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- You're wrong, Jinkx,
on the lollipop.
- Roxxxy's grasping at straws
to try to shake me.
- Jinkx, your sweet 16 party
girl--16 going on 47.
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect
and it makes me question
your taste level.
- Alaska, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
- [squeals]
- Jinkx Monsoon...
shantay, you stay.
Detox, sashay away.
- [whimpers]
- Holy shit.
- Detox just went home.
This has been the hardest
elimination for me.
My baby.
- What giant lips she has.
- If I was
on that judges' panel,
Jinkx would have been gone.
Jinkx does not deserve
to be here.
No offense, Jinkx, but I know
what they were saying about
looking 70 'cause you did look
a little older.
- But that's how Jinkx Monsoon
would have looked.
She would have been 16
in the '70s.
I know Roxxxy is upset that she
doesn't get to go through this
last part of the competition
with her best friend.
But I'm not gonna stop fighting
for this
until the very, very end.
- One of the three of us is
going to win $100,000.
- How many challenges have you
won, Jinkx?
- Two. We've all won two.
- You've won two and I've won
two.
- Ooh, an even playing ground
except I've never lip-synced.
I'm coming right off winning
last week's challenge.
So I just say bring it on,
darling.
Alaska is back in full force.
- Alaska thinks she can just
slide right underneath the radar
and go for the crown.
But guess what, bitch.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Alaska, my dear, sashay away.
- Words you will never hear.
- The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip courtesy
of ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--and a cash
prize of $100,000.
- Top three, fantasy.
- Top three,
fantasy.
Where my top three at?
- [sighs] Aw, look.
I have a note.
- Oh, my gosh.
A little note from Detoxy.
- It says, "Roxxxy, this was
such an amazing journey
and I'm so thankful to have made
it with you."
- Mine says, "Lasky, you're
fucking terrible.
I love you so much."
- And--and I didn't get a note.
[laughs]
- You didn't get a note?
- No.
- Well, here. I'll make one up
from Detox to you.
"Jinkx, you sent me home,
you fucking hot fucking mess."
[laughs]
[alarm blares]
- Ooh, girl.
You've got shemail.
Ladies, make a case why you
should be America's
next drag superstar and you
could be awarded
a judgment of $100,000.
And if you're really lucky,
you might even get a hung jury.
- What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all squeal]
- She has legs.
- And I know how to use 'em.
- [laughs]
- The final three!
Condragulations.
[all cheer]
RuPaul is getting some
last-minute cosmetic procedures.
So he asked me to tell you
all about your final challenge.
And it's a doozy.
This week, you'll be starring
with RuPaul
in the official music video
for<i> The Beginning.</i>
- [squeals]
- You'll be working with
choreographer Candis Cayne.
- Continental.
- And then, with director
Mathu Andersen,
you'll be shooting a dramatic
courtroom scene.
And each of you will be playing
defendant,
defense attorney,
and prosecutor.
All three parts.
And on the main stage, you'll
need to defend your life
and convince the judges and the
world why you deserve
to be America's next drag
superstar.
- If there's something
in this competition
that I've been waiting for,
it's to express to these judges
why I should be America's next
drag superstar.
- To help you build an ironclad
case, you'll each have
one-on-one time with mega
attorney Gloria Allred.
- [gasps]
- [laughs]
- And if that wasn't enough,
you're having lunch
with RuPaul too.
- Oh, my god.
- [laughs]
So don't fuck it up.
- Hello, girls.
all: Hi.
- Last year, I had choreography,
but to step it up,
I thought I would add a little
chiffonography.
Today, we're going for a
seductive, goddess-y theme.
A lot of fans, a lot of hair, a
lot of chiffon in the fan.
I want you to be sexy, soft,
beautiful.
- Okay.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
- [squeals]
- Alaska, you're getting
nervous, it seems like.
And think about not turning in.
'Cause that's kind of not the
choreography.
- I'm making a fool of myself
in front of Candis Cayne.
- All right, girls.
We're gonna do some hairography.
Bring me my fan.
[all gasp]
The basic point of fan use is
all about flicking your hair.
The fast and then the slow.
Very good.
- I am definitely the most sexy.
I know how to work some
motherfucking hair.
And, uh, I like being blown.
- Give me goddess.
Try not to let your hair
in your face.
Uh...
This is challenging
choreography.
Think more Beyonce and less
Cousin It.
But, you know,
this is the top three
and I really need them
to step up.
Whip it.
-<i> Bonjour.</i>
- It's time for us to shoot a
music video
for RuPaul's<i> The Beginning.</i>
Nice car.
- [laughs]
- The basic idea here is that
you're driving into the wild
blue yonder
and you're going to fly
to heaven.
[all laugh]
- Wow.
- Action. Whoa!
Whoa!
And left.
- Oh!
- Okay, we have a tragedy.
- Oh, she trying to pull the
patch!
- [yelps]
Dear god, do I really have
to be attached to her now too?
- Drive, drive, stop!
[horn beeps]
- Whoa!
- What?
[all laugh]
- Jinkx kind of took over,
going crazy and having fun.
- [laughs]
- And here she is.
It's Mama Ru.
Oh, my lord.
Alaska, shake your hair out.
- Alaska, did you not get
the concept of hairography?
Afro?
- Okay, we've sped this song up
1 1/2 times
so that when we slow it down,
the effect will be lip-syncing
perfectly to the song.
Let the chipmunkery begin.
Cue the music.
[song sped up]
[rapid, high-pitched singing]
- What?
- And now we have to sell the
lip-sync at double the speed?
I feel like I'm going insane.

I need you to be on, Alaska.
It's about precision, precision,
precision.
From the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Pick it up, Alaska.
Cut.
- The other girls are doing
really good
and their hair is flowing
and their chiffon is flowing in
the right places, and I'm, like,
terrible and this is awful.
- What are your winning
qualities?
- Um...
- You need to believe
in yourself.
- For you to just discredit
all my work--
- I know, you're the victim.
- I have done well
in this competition
and I love what I do.
- Huh?
[laughter]
- Hi.
- Hi, Alaska.
- Gloria Allred is a mega lawyer
who is known for
taking on really high-profile
cases.
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Tomorrow, we are going to have
to present
our final arguments
as to why we should be
America's next drag superstar.
- Let's go right to what your
case is gonna be.
What are your winning qualities
that are unique to you?
- I have star quality.
The "X" factor.
- That's not good enough.
Give me specifics.
What is your most important
strength?
- Um...
- Just lay it on me.
- Well, I mean, I guess we can
see which one
you think is the most impactful.
- Okay, but you need to believe
in yourself.
Now, when you go out there
to make your argument,
you're gonna need to make it
with confidence.
Do you think you can do that?
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi, Jinkx.
How's tricks?
- Tricks are for kids.
I'm a lady.
- [laughs]
Listen, I hope you have
an appetite.
- Oh, yes.
This looks more than I can
handle.
- Now, Jinkx, what do you think
your life's gonna be like?
What--what do you want to do?
- It's been my life dream ever
since I started doing drag
to do drag on Broadway.
- I could see you
as Blanche DuBois.
- I could see that too.
- So what was it like for you
growing up?
I know that you had to sort of
grow up really fast.
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me about that.
- I had no real mother in my
house when I was a teenager
because of her alcoholism.
There were times where me and my
brothers wouldn't have
gone to school that day if I
hadn't gotten us up.
- What effect has that had on
who you are as Jinkx Monsoon?
- This is my way of making peace
with a dark childhood
and make light of the disheveled
kind of crazy, kooky mom.
And then I adapted into my
mature drag queen
from yesteryear character.
- Right, so--and so you're
saving the Britney Spears
part of your career for later.
- It never even occurred to me
before my lunch with Ru
that maybe the reason I do drag
as an older character
is because I never really
connected with my childhood.
- I think you're
a really bright star
and I'm so happy you're here.
- Thank you.
I'm happy I'm here too.
- [laughs]
- And I'm not gonna eat these.
I'm gonna make a necklace
out of 'em.
- Oh, good.
[laughs]
- What are your unique strengths
that should persuade the judges
and everyone else
to vote for you?
- My unique strengths are that I
have shown you
that time after time,
when presented challenges,
that I could succeed even when I
didn't believe I could.
And I learned that not being
perfect is being perfect.
- Okay, let's stop right now.
What you don't want is you don't
want kind of pageant babble.
- Okay.
- As the kids would say,
keep it real.
You think you can do that?
- Yeah.
- All right.
What are some of the obstacles
that you have faced
and how have you overcome those
obstacles?
- Actually before coming
to this competition,
I wanted to quit doing drag.
I was done.
I was done with the criticism
from the audience.
I was done with nobody
wanting to date me
because I'm a drag queen.
- Okay, but how did you
overcome it?
- Woman, can I speak?
- Remember, I want to...
- Yeah. I--well--
- Get the negative
into the positive.
- I overcame it by realizing
that God has given me a gift.
And I consider myself
a chameleon.
'Cause when the lights, camera,
action, that curtain opens
and you don't know
what's coming out,
that's the excitement of going
to a drag show.
- What would you say are some
of the weaknesses
of your competitors, Roxxxy?
- Jinkx needs to stop being
such a one-shtick kind of girl.
Alaska, in the kids' show,
came out as a boy.
This is a drag competition.
Where's the beauty?
Where's the creativity?
It pisses me off.
- You're showing passion,
so that's all good.
But how can you say this without
being too, kind of, catty?
- Hello, Alaska.
- Hi.
- [laughs]
Now, if you win,
what would it be like
to be part of drag's first
royal couple?
- Wow, I would feel just like
Kate Middleton.
I would rule the drag world
with dignity and grace
and lots of lace front wigs.
- [laughs]
Tell me something I don't know
about you.
What are you afraid of?
- I have a fear of dying.
- Why?
- Because I f--I've worked--
I've worked so hard to get so
many things in my life
that I'm so happy to have.
And I guess it's just a fear of,
like, losing that.
Like, my relationship
with Sharon.
It's like a castle that we built
and I don't want it to--
to go away by me dying,
you know?
It's a crazy love that Sharon
and I have
and it's something that I never
expected to happen.
She's my soul mate.
And I don't know that I've ever
had that before.
- Don't be afraid of that.
Just practice living
in this moment.
Think about how sweet it is
right now.
I am so proud of you.
Good luck, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
- What do you think
are your strengths
that are superior to your
competitors'?
- I'm a captivating performer
onstage
and I think comedy and the
ability to make people laugh
is such a huge and important
part of drag.
- But what about your
competitors?
I noticed you kind of shied away
from that.
- The thing that pushes me out
of my comfort zone the most
is when I have to talk poorly
about my other competitors
because I have a huge respect
for every drag queen.
- You sound like a person who
wants to be positive,
but in this competition...
- Yeah.
- You're gonna need to elevate
yourself up...
- Mm-hmm.
- And move them down.
- Well, hey, Roxxxy.
- Hi, Ru.
- You've done really well with
meeting the challenge head on
with this fearless attitude.
Have you always been that way?
- I've always been a competitor.
That's what drove me
to pageants.
- What do you want people to
take away from your experience?
- I came in here wanting to
represent for the big girls,
and, you know, a big girl has
made the top three.
And I think it's time to crown
a thick and juicy kind of girl.
Being a gay man
and being thicker,
it's harder, but I love it.
I'm representing
for the big girls.
I can't wait to make them all
proud of me and, you know,
let them know that,
hey, love yourself.
- You're an amazing queen.
- Thank you.
- You are an amazing queen.
- Oh, my god.
- Thanks, Roxxxy.
- Thank you, Ru, so much.
This isn't a joke to me.
I've had it.
I've fucking had it.
I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.
[laughter]
- We're right about to do our
courtroom scene,
directed by Mathu Andersen,
in which we all
have to play three distinctly
different characters:
the witness, the defense
attorney, and the prosecutor.
- Ladies, you've been instructed
to create
different characters
for each role.
So blow me away.
Here we go. Action.
- All rise for the honorable
Judge Rudy.
- Order in the courtroom,
hunties.
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.
- As the defense attorney, I
would like to submit my briefs.
- Cut.
Alaska, I 'd like to know what
your inspiration
and motivation for your
character at the moment.
- Her name is Peg Hollis.
She smokes two packs of Misty
Slim Menthol 100s
and she's a hard-ass.
She's going on 60.
40 years in the business.
Graduated law school at 20.
I don't know how that happened.
[all laugh]
- It's a miscarriage of justice.
[laughs]
- "I smoke 80 packs of Virginia
Slims every day."
I'm sorry, that's not funny
to me.
- Okay, and action.
- Those hideous, uh, drag queens
had it coming.
It was a murd--mercy murder.
- Cut.
- Sorry, I messed that up.
- Taking a deep breath,
and... action.
- If I'm guilty of being
anything up in "herrre,"
it's of being fierce.
- And cut. Roxxxy?
- Uh-huh?
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxxxy Andrews.
A ghetto bitch.
- Roxxxy's character of Roxxxy
is definitely Tamar Braxton.
- Where my people at?
Where my people at?
- Dot-com.
- Okay, ladies.
It's time to do musical chairs
and change into your next
character.
Hit the changing rooms.
So here we go.
Action.
- Judge Rudy, the prosecution
would like to submit
the murder weapon.
- Objection!
Reading the witness.
- You want answers?
- We want the "T," stupid.
- You can't handle the "T."
- Jinkx was the most solid
in her characterizations.
She has the leading edge
in this courtroom drama.
And cut.
Big change.
Next role.
Okay, ladies.
I see you're all in different
positions and ready to go...
on action!
- Those damn fucking drag queens
had it coming.
- I say, I say--
- Cut, cut, cut, cut.
One moment.
Just gonna back up a little bit
because, um...
- I said a bad word.
- You said naughty words.
Action.
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove
that the accused is one cold,
hard-blooded bitch.
Biatch.
- Cut.
Roxxxy, what's the motivation
for your character?
- Uh, actually just a bitch.
- Okay.
Jinkx Monsoon?
- Her name is Daisy A. Irwin
and she's a little older than
she tries to pass herself off as
and she's just a simple
Southern lawyer.
- Fantastic. Alaska?
- I hope I don't go to prison,
but if I do,
I hope it's a men's prison.
- [laughs]
Okay, really bring it.
I want to see Satan,
ancient crone, and...bitch.
Action!
- I say, I say, objection.
- And Alaska?
- What's the line?
- "I can't face it."
- I can't face it.
I can't face it.
[sobs]
- What is it you can't face?
- What did you just call her?
- Roxxxy, humor me.
Your spit take
was a bit overly long.
Try and get the water
out of your mouth
so you can get to your line.
- Okay.
What did you just call her?
- Spit takes are usually a bit
more, "Puh!"
Nnn!
- Am I still not doing it right?
- Tight.
It seemed a little bit
problematic for Roxxxy
with the old spit take.
I just need you to snort it out
like a, "Puh!"
"What did you say?"
- I didn't know you wanted me
to say the line.
- You can tell it's really
affecting her
when Mathu calls her out.
The frustration
has gotten to the point
where you can tell she's mad.
- Ladies, guess what.
That's a wrap.
- Whew.
- [groans]
- This isn't even my character
anymore.
I just literally
have the shakes.
This day has been so long.
- [laughs]
My brain is completely gone.
- Melted.
- Are you okay, Roxxxy?
- I'm perfectly fine.
- No, you're not. You're upset.
- You guys are comedy girls,
so your spit takes were fine.
Didn't know a courtroom scene
was comedic.
- Girl.
It's a courtroom scene
that's written to be funny.
This is not<i> NCIS.</i>
- I take what I do extremely
professional and real
and I don't make a joke
out of everything.
And they're gonna read me 'cause
I'm lost
because there's
so much bullshit going on.
So trying to sell comedy,
trying to sell comedy,
trying to outdo each other--
I know what I've done
and I've--
I-I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.
I'm sick of the gimmicks.
I feel that America's next
drag superstar
should take her career a little
more serious
than completely joking
all the fucking time.
I'm so--I've had it.
I've fucking had it.
This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think you--
- This competition
is extremely serious
and it's the rest of my life.
Girl, I'm over it.
Why do I have to make up a name
to who I'm doing?
I'm acting like an attorney.
A bitch.
Why do I have to have some kind
of fucking character?
"Well, I'm so and so.
And I do this
and I'm 80 years old."
No, you're not 80 years old.
You're Jinkx Monsoon
playing a character.
- Roxxxy has admitted
to me before
that she's lashed out at me
when she's felt insecure
with her performance.
And she's obviously
doing it again.
- I'm just frustrated with this
whole fucking competition.
- I'm sorry if you missed the
mark on this challenge,
but stop trying to blame
everyone else
when you don't do well.
- The time has come for you
to defend your life.
[laughter]
- Ah!
- It's the last time we're gonna
see this place.
It's the final day.
And I just want to soak up this
experience
for everything it's worth.
- How did you guys feel
about yesterday?
- Yeah. Um--
- You know--
- I know I had a breakdown,
but the buffoonery that was
going on in that room?
All of our characters
are not supposed to be funny.
- Yes, they are.
- I think they were.
- No, they're not.
- I love how you say, "comedy,"
like it's a bad thing.
- Well, honey,
not all drag is comedy.
- I take comedy very seriously.
Comedy is not poking fun
at drag.
Like, comedy's--
- Well, it's not funny to me.
And the fact that drag continues
to get insulted
in this competition
is not funny to me.
They're making fun of drag.
I take my drag very seriously
and I look good
from head to toe.
Not in the same shoes
since day one.
Not in the same wig
since day one.
Sorry, I change it up.
- So what has been
your favorite moment
throughout this competition?
- Seeing you in the bottom two.
- I just don't get
what's so rewarding
about being hurtful like that.
- I'm not being hurtful.
I'm being truthful.
You asked me.
I gave you an answer.
You skated through this whole
competition.
- For you to just discredit
all my work,
it just shows how immature
and bitter you are.
- I can't hear you.
I'm blow-drying my hair.
- I would never discredit
your form of drag.
- Huh?
- It doesn't make me feel good
to talk to other people the way
you talk to me sometimes.
- I know, you're the victim.
Everybody hates you and nobody
gets you and--
- I'm not a victim.
I've been very strong throughout
this competition.
- Roxxxy's a pageant girl,
and those pageant girls
play some wicked mind games
backstage.
- I know it's gonna get under
her skin.
I want her going in tonight
bothered.
Jinkx is competition to me and
I'm gonna do anything to get her
off her track.
- Victims blame other people
when they don't do well.
- You're getting all angry and--
- I have done well
in this competition
and I love what I do,
so I am not angry.
- This was the gas that I needed
for tonight.
I'm ready to tell the judges why
these two jokes should go home.
They have no idea what's coming
to this runway.
I'm here to win America's next
drag superstar,
and I'm going for blood.
- Alaska, what's been your
favorite part
of this competition?
- Seeing you in the bottom two.
[laughs]
- [laughter]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, judges.
Tonight, it's just family.
Michelle Visage,
can I get a witness?
- Of course.
You got one right here.
- Santino Rice, any objections?
- Just one, Ru.
You are looking too damn fine
tonight.
- Oh.
- [laughs]
- Objection!
Ass-kissing overruled.
- For their final challenge,
our queens starred
in the official music video
for my latest single,<i> </i>
<i>The Beginning.</i>
And tonight, they're ready
to hit the runway
in their very best drag
as they prepare
to defend their lives.
Are you ready for some justice
to be served?
- Bring it.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
- First up, the queen
on everybody's lips,
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Ooh!
- Glamour.
- This is my last time walking
this runway
and I'm feeling
so good right now.
The dress is stone
from head to toe.
I'm giving them a little bit
of my hair.
I'm feeling absolutely
glamorous.
- Foxy Roxxxy.
- She must have just come
from Paisley Park.
- Where my Paisley at?
- [laughs]
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- Aww.
- Fairy tale come to life.
- Very<i> Princess Bride.</i>
- It is.
- I am exuding beauty
from within.
I want them to see how gorgeous
and proud I feel.
- Like, it's soft, earthy Jinkx.
- She's a real
Renaissance woman.
- What kind of sauce
is Renee sauce?
- Ooh, it's good
on some chicken.
- Mmm.
- Up next, 49th state, Alaska.
High fash-i-on.
- That's what she's giving you.
- Yes, she's giving some fear up
in here.
- I'm coming down the runway
and I'm looking like a high
fashion ghoul
and I feel lovely.
- Oh, she got some booty today.
- Oh, yeah.
That's what she got
from her mama.
She's wearing
a lace front dress.
[all laugh]
Welcome, ladies.
The judges' final critique
is now in session.
Let's take a look
at the evidence.
- As the defense attorney, I 'd
like to submit my briefs.
- The state accuses Roxxxy
Andrews
of deplorable acts
of slayin' bitches.
- I plead guilty of being
devastatingly beautiful.
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.
It was a mercy killing.
- The evidence
will prove beyond a doubt
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.
- Objection!
Reading the witness!
- The prosecution would like
to submit the murder weapon.
A size three stiletto.
- But I wear a size 14.
- If the pup don't fit,
you must acquit.
- [laughs]
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
[laughter]
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Tonight, you look fantastic.
And what's been really exciting,
Roxxxy,
is seeing you come in
as a pageant queen
and you leave as a fully
rounded--pardon the pun--queen.
- In that video,
you exuded sex appeal.
Your hairography was on point.
Then in the courtroom scene,
there was a point where
some of the characters started
to blend a little bit for me.
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- You gave so many different,
varied performances.
Tyler Perry better watch out.
- I think her head piece tonight
is adorable,
but the dress
is just not my favorite.
It's very prom-ish. Very '80s.
- But your face looks amazing.
And you moved like you feel
beautiful tonight.
- All right, next up, Alaska.
Hi-eee!
- Hi-eee!
- Tonight, I really loved this
look on you.
The courtroom, your characters
were realized,
thought out, and you may not
be the strongest dancer,
but I think you made it work.
I don't know if I would have
chosen an afro.
- You had a lot to live up to.
And I think now you're--you're
not in anyone's shadow.
You're standing as Alaska.
You're your own queen.
- You've made so many of my
dreams come true being here.
It means everything to me.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Ladies, now we are ready
for your closing arguments.
Convince me
and everyone watching
why you deserve to be America's
next drag superstar.
The time has come for you
to defend your life.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- The reason I should be
America's next drag superstar?
What they don't have, I do have.
I have grace, I have beauty,
I have professionalism.
I want to be a person that kids
look up to.
I am a thick and juicy girl,
and that makes me so proud.
I could never let you down.
And I will be one hell
of a superstar.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Growing up, I was continually
an outcast,
and in my teen years,
I discovered drag.
So even though I was hurting
at home, I was living onstage.
My whole life, I've danced
to the beat of a different drum.
And when I came here, I took
the critiques and I was able to
adapt and grow while still being
true to who I am as a performer.
And anything else was just water
off a duck's back.
- [laughs]
- Thank you, Jinkx.
- Um, can I say something else?
- What's on your mind?
- I said something to Jinkx
earlier today that I just--
it has nothing
to do with the runway,
but I want to apologize to her.
I really didn't mean that,
and I really do love you.
I love you.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Last, but not least, Alaska.
- When it comes
to pleading our case,
Roxxxy and Jinkx totally
copped out.
We're supposed to say
why the other queens
shouldn't be America's
next drag superstar.
My name is Alaska,
and I am hungry
to be America's next drag
superstar.
Not hungry.
I'm practically starving.
As for my fellow competitors
tonight, Roxxxy was faced
with a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.
What did she present?
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.
And Jinkx Monsoon.
During the Sugar Ball,
she failed not just one,
not just two, but three
different looks.
I am the queen who takes the
tragic and turns it into magic.
I take trash and turn it into
treasure.
And having never fallen
into the bottom two,
I am Alaska and I am America's
next drag superstar!
Thank you.
- Wow.
Thank you, Alaska.
And thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the Interior
Illusions Lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, now, just between us
girls, what do you think?
Let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy is the embodiment
of a superstar.
In the music video, she whipped
that hair.
- She a video ho.
- She's thick and juicy.
She--she owns it
and she's come up
with some pretty amazing looks
this season.
- She comes from the pageant
world of drag.
To go from that
to this competition,
she's a fully-rounded
entertainer.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Unlike Roxxxy, Jinkx does not
care at all what she looks like
and will go completely
into a character.
- She's in love with her craft.
And you see it
in everything she does,
but her style is--is lacking.
- But if we saw Carol Burnett
out at a red carpet event
and she looked a hot mess,
are you even gonna care?
- She talked about dancing to
the beat of a different drummer
and that's something each of us
on this panel right now
can relate to.
Miss Alaska.
- The cards were stacked
against her.
I love that she's persevered
through that.
- Alaska's got a really great,
sick, twisted sense of humor.
I like that she was able
to drop down that wall.
Mr. Gorbachev,
knock down that wall.
- [laughs]
- And when she gave us more
vulnerability,
I loved her even more.
Her defend-your-life speech
was the best.
- Well, they worked
with Gloria Allred.
- But she was the only one
out of the three
that read the other two.
- Yeah.
- It was actually part
of the assignment.
- Yes.
- Alaska has evolved
understanding the power,
not only of drag,
but the power of Alaska.
They're all so different.
Let's just break it down.
This week, Roxxxy really rocked
the music video,
Jinkx excelled
at the courtroom scene,
and when it came
to defending her life,
Alaska had the upper hand.
Damn, this is a photo finish.
- Hell, yeah.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
[laughter]
Welcome back, ladies.
Only one of you will be named
America's next drag superstar
and walk away with a prize
package that includes a crown
designed by Fierce Drag Jewels
and a cash prize...
of $100,000.
Now, based on your performance
in this week's final challenge
and throughout the season,
each of you
has earned the right
to lip-sync for your life.
- I have never lip-synced
for my life before, and now
I have to lip-sync against two
other queens for $100,000.
Help me, Mommy.
- Three amazing queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and prove to the world
that you are America's
next drag superstar.
- This is the last chance
to show ourselves to Ru,
the judges, and the whole world.
- I'm so ready for this.
I'm ready to dance,
I'm ready to show them
why I should be America's
next drag superstar.
It's what I'm here for.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

could still go
to any one of you.
Now I need the help of<i> Drag Race</i>

needs all the help you can give,
tonight and all week long.
Now speaking of favorites,
I want to check in with
my countdown correspondents,
Latrice Royale, Willam,
and Sharon Needles.
Welcome, ladies.
- Hi-yee!
- Hey, Ru.
- Can you help me make sense
of this crazy season?
- Ru, the suspense is killing
me, and not in a good way.
My marriage is at stake.
- Boo-hoo. I'm mad.
Season five was all about
performing,
and I could have tore it up,
like an episiotomy.
- Ooh, Ru, I'm living
for these season five girls.
Honey, you've got some funny
characters on this season.
Bitch, I live!
- Well, thank you, ladies.
I'll be checking back with you
in just a minute.
Now, to truly understand
how Alaska, Jinkx, and Roxxxy
ascended to the top three,
we need to do an instant RuPlay
of the bad-ass bitches they beat
down in their battle to become
America's Next Drag Superstar.
Game on.
- Hello, boys.
- Week one, Cincinnati cougar
Penny Tration hit the field
with a seasoned swagger.
Thousands of fans voted to get
her here,
but it took just one devastating
block by rookie
Serena Chacha to send
her packing.
all: Hi!
- College draft pick Serena
Chacha arrived a young pup,
eager to run with the big dogs.
- I have a feeling you just
like to be the only pretty one.
- I just think you're annoying.
- But on her second outing,
a flag on the play...
- Doo-de-doo-de-doo.
- Signaled that Serena was a
little out of her league,
and she cha-cha'd her way out
of the game.
- To the other queens,
pick up a book and go read.
- Hello, girls.
- Big-hearted Banji girl
Monica Beverly Hillz...
- With a "Z."
- Was a prospect with promise.
- Monica Beverly Hillz
is very good at giving face.
- While she didn't always bring
her "A" game...
- Can't you see I'm trying to
get some sunlight--
[stammers]
-<i> Cut!</i>
She bravely shared her "T"
with the rest of the world.
And when she lip-synched
for her life against Coco,
Monica Beverly Hillz
was sent back to
the 9-0-2-1-oh, no,
she better don't.
- Hey, sisters.
- San Francisco treat
Honey Mahogany
brought her own mystique
to the challenges.
- Bitch, I am from Chicago!
- But in her dance debut,
her kicks were incomplete.
- You know, I've never done
Diana before.
- Clearly.
- Hey, y'all.
- Week after week, catch
of the day Vivienne Pinay
felt stiff-armed
by the competition.
- Great.
A bunch of loudmouths.
- But her dance in the end zone
failed to put her
on the scoreboard.
A lackluster lip sync came down
to a coin toss,
and both Honey and Vivienne
hit the showers
in<i> Drag Race's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first</i>
double elimination.
- Oh!
- Oh, word!
- Now, if pretty scored you
extra points,
Lineysha Sparx would have been
an all-star.
Her Tyra-nese performance got
her named MVP.
But sadly, Lineysha's snatch
game was over before it began...
- French fries.
- Leaving Detox to bench
this beauty for good.
- Hey, girls, hey!
- Jade Jolie arrived all
sparkles, rainbows,
and sunshine.
Her laugh was her best defense.
- [laughing]
- But still this queen could
dominate the offense whenever
shade was in play.
- Some people shouldn't come
down and wear a two-piece
because the view
that I had was not too cute.
- But instead of finding
her voice...
- ♪<i> Can I get an amen?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ♪</i>
- She found herself lip-synching
against Coco,
and in the end, sashayed away.
- Uh-oh.
- Hey, ladies! Aah!
- Oh!
- Ivy Winters turned out to be
a triple threat.
She could sew, she could sing,
and she gave great face.
Although sometimes it seemed her
presentation
was a little stilted.
Wah!
Sadly, a fumble in the fragrance
challenge...
- New York City.
- Uh, that's Tokyo.
- Kept this queen from making
the final playoffs.
Texas Tornado Alyssa Edwards
hit the field,
ready to play hard
and settle old scores.
- Game on, bitch.
The sequel.
- She gave game face
for the ages.
- [smacks lips]
- And her countless
Alyssa-isms...
- I don't get cute.
I get drop-dead gorgeous.
- Gave inspiration...
-<i> Back rolls!</i>
- To the nation.
-<i> Why you being cute?</i>
- On the main stage,
this dancing diva
had all the right moves.
But by the telenovella...
- I have the same disease!
- Her pageant prance
was played out.
- What?
- And she was sent home
by her archrival...
Coco Montrese.
- The diva has arrived!
- A Vegas veteran who was
always ready to rumble...
- Don't try it, little boy.
- Or lip-synch the house down.
Ever the underdog, Coco scored
a big win at the roast...
- Pants so high, he look like
he in New Orleans at
Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[laughter]
- But dropped the ball
in the army-navy makeover,
forcing this beauty queen
to take her final bow.
Feeling overwhelmed?
You need to Detox.
This silicone cyclone put in
major work before suiting up
for<i> Drag Race.</i>
- I've had my hips
and my ass done.
I've had my pecs done.
Underneath my eyes done.
My six-pack done.
- And once here,
she had a few surprises
to pull out of her b-b-b-box!
- [clucking] Hi, kids!
- A runway rock star, Detox
never let us see her sweat...
all: Oh!
- Prompting some to accuse her
of coasting toward the end zone.
Ultimately this final four
standout
hit a sugar wall
in the sugar ball.
And after losing her lip sync
to Jinkx,
parting was bittersweet.
- I've had it. Bye.
- Well, there you have it,
skorts fans.
This season's rocky road
to the top three.
Damn!
I need a protein shake.
Coming up...
- The shade of it all.
-<i> With Latrice, Willam,</i>
<i>and Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>Plus never-before-seen</i>
<i>too-hot-for-Drag-Race outtakes.</i>
- Come here and sit on my face,
bitch.
- And for the first time
anywhere,
we reveal<i> Untucked:</i>
<i>The Lost Episode.</i>
- No one's hiding any knives or
shivs on their dresses,
are they?
- Keep tweeting who you want to
be crowned America's Next
Drag Superstar,
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Countdown</i>
<i>to the Crown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
[laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race: Countdown to the Crown.</i>
This has been the stormiest
season on record.
- I could give a fuck.
- One thing's for sure,
the forecast always included
a 100% chance of...
- Shade.
- Early in the season,
super storm Coco collided
with hurricane Alyssa
and let us have it.
- I don't think she wants
to talk about it.
But we're gonna talk about it...
if she doesn't go home first.
- Shade.
- Just pearls hanging off
her boobs, baby.
- Very you.
- Shade.
She's won several pageants,
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.
- Shade.
And then the tears come out.
And the Academy Award goes to...
- Shade.
You need to be worried about
what's going over there with
that same makeup
every single time.
- Look how orange you
fucking look, girl!
- Girls, you're both pretty.
both: Shade.
- Now is it just me, or are you
over this pageant feud mess?
Officially.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
Now I got some extra yummy,
never-before-seen leftovers
from the RuPaul roast.
- Michelle, your nails are
so long,
how the fuck do you wipe
your ass?
- Oh-ho!
- But better yet, how do you
wipe Ru's before you kiss it?
[laughter]
- Let me tell y'all about
Santino.
All the hems on his clothes
be crooked.
You know why?
'Cause he's always looking
at you like this.
[laughter]
- Knock, knock.
all: Who's there?
- Ivy Winters.
all: Ivy Winters who?
- Exactly.
[laughter]
- RuPaul, you don't need
a roast, mama.
By the looks of your face,
it's been roasting
for quite some time.
[laughter]
- Ru, you're always saying,
"You're born naked,
and the rest is drag."
but in your case,
you were born naked,
and the rest was just fucking
terrible.
[laughter]
- Now, joining us live from
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Weather Center,</i>
mother meteorologist
Latrice Royale.
Hi.
- Hi. I got news for you.
- Ooh, child.
Now what do you think of all the
romper room fuckery this season?
- Ru, I have one thing to say.
The shade.
The shade of it all.
- [laughs]
Now, Latrice, does the
competition bring out the worst
in some queens?
Or are they just shady ladies?
- RuPaul, in my experience,
the camera don't lie,
and neither do I.
Oh, and, girls, stop blaming
the editing, okay?
- Bible.
Bible, girl, uh-huh.
Tell it. Tell it!
- But you know what I love
about<i> Drag Race?</i>
Just when you think everything
has gone dark,
out comes a rainbow
of truth and light!
Hallelujah.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's take a look at some of
the most heartwarming moments
this season.
- Hey, Alyssa, this is Dad.
- Oh!
- I just want you to know...
- [cries]
- [cries] I'm proud of you.
And now I'm not ashamed
to tell people my son's gay.
- Oh! Oh, my God.
[crying]
- Forgiveness is free, baby.
Give all you can.
- I've just been holding
a secret in,
and I've been trying so hard
and--
- What secret?
- I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
Every day is hard.
- I invited you here
because you were fierce.
The only person
who does not believe is you.
Stay strong,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I will.
- God makes no mistakes.
You be you, child.
- I continually regret and,
like, second-guess the fact that
I left my youngest brother
with a woman who wasn't ready
to be a mom.
When I'm, like, doing shit like
this, I feel so selfish...
- Don't, Jinkx, don't.
- [cries] To have left
my youngest brother.
- Don't.
Not at all.
- It feels like--right now,
like I've abandoned him.
- You haven't.
- Patience and love, honey.
Patience and love.
- My mother left my sister
and myself
at a bus stop
when I was three.
[cries] I try to stay so strong,
but I'm so weak
at the same time.
[crying]
It just hurts that I was left.
Nobody cared.
- You know, we as gay people,
we get to choose our family,
you know?
We get to choose the people
that we're around.
I am your family.
We are a family here.
- Bless us all.
Bless us all.
This is large and in charge,
chunky, yet funky,
Latrice Royale.
Back to you, Ru.
- Thank you, my queen.
- Aah!
[beep]
- Tonight, we're getting up
close and personal
with each
of our top three queens,
starting in alphabetical order
with the 49th state, Alaska.
Wiggling in from Pittsburgh,
Alaska arrived as a dark horse.
She auditioned for every season,
only to watch her girlfriend
snatch the crown last year.
But when this bowlegged beauty
arrived, she had me at "Hi-yee!"
- Hi-yee!
- Hi-yee!
- Hi-yee!
Hi-yee.
Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.
- She tanked her first challenge
and quickly joined forces
with Rolaskatox.
But after some tough love...
- No!
- Alaska declared a state
of independence.
- Alaska.
- Until last week, she was the
only queen never to lip-synch
for her life.
And, girl, when it comes
to making us laugh,
Alaska has always been
right on the money.
- [whispering]
Your makeup is terrible.
- From the fragrance challenge
to the sugar ball,
she delivered one
of the strongest finishes
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>
And her triumphant testimony
on the main stage last week
showed us why Alaska could be
America's Next Drag Superstar.
So if you believe in Alaska,
let me feel it.

Raphael say about our queens.
Plus,<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Deep Dish with</i>
Willam and Sharon Needles.
- And I'm currently sitting on
my balls, like Mother Goose.
Honk!
- And a Ru-on-Ru
exclusive interview.
And later, we reveal
for the first time anywhere,
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode...</i>
- You can be glamorous without,
like, 1,000 million stones
on your dress.
- Oh, Miss Thing.
- As<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown</i>
keeps on keeping on.
[laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race: Countdown to the Crown.</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans are the best</i>
fans in the whole wide world.
And because of you, our show
is trending on Twitter,
taking over Tumblr,
and winning America's
favorite reality show
on RyanSeacrest.com.
That's RyanSeacrest.com.
Hi-yee!
When it comes to<i> Drag Race,</i>
celebrities are just like us.
When they see something they
love, they tweet all about it.
Rolaskatox had Adam Lambert
gagging.
The legendary Sally Jessy
Raphael lives for Jinkx Monsoon.
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're special.
Shout-out to you.
- And Nicki Minaj is in love
with my girls.
Her favorite new expression...
- All "T," all shade.
- And, Mariah,
what you got, girl?
Now this next queen is so viral,
she's sickening.
Hi, Willam.
- Thanks, Ru.
Hey, superfans, you tweeted us
questions, and I got answers.
[beeping]
@johnbrunskill--
that's a lot of name.
"If you had to pick,
which season five gal
would you kai kai with?"
Coco, she's black.
@mcbrewster,
"You're a friend of Detox."
@fozziebare, "Don't you agree
that we need #LessFishMoreFun?"
No.
If you want ugly,
turn on Discovery Network.
Good-bye.
@bck2mono--
Oh, I've had that too.
[chuckles]
"What was more shocking,
the Honey and Vivienne Pinay
double elimination or yours?"
Mine.
They didn't even throw up.
Fucking amateurs.
@RuPaul, "Love you baby,
but your time is up.
Thanks, gi--"
Oh, I gotta go.
- Thanks, Willam.
And for the record, opinions
expressed by Willam
do not reflect that
of RuPaul Inc.,
Logo TV, President Obama,
or Tuckahoe State Prison
for ladies.
- [hums]
- Now, our superfans don't just
watch the show,
they do recaps and become stars
in their own right.
I love them all.
But these are some
of my favorites.
Can I get a RuCap up in here?
- Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.
- That was best episode ever!
- Whoever is making up these
mini-challenges, bitch,
they need an Emmy.
Did you see--whew!
- My favorite walk
of this runway was Alyssa.
- [laughs]
both: Alyssa Edwards.
- She ain't gonna win.
- With that fucking
faux dog-rat thing.
- [laughs]
- That is if she don't go home
first.
- Like, I wanted, like,
5, 6, 7, 24, 52.
- Jade is a string of pearls
away from becoming a showgirl!
- I am serving you fish, honey.
Fish on a platter.
[laughs]
- It was the best mini-challenge
of any reality TV show,
past, present, and motherfucking
future, bitches.
- Some of the biggest
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
are our extra special
guest judges.
Hold onto your wigs for
celebrity guest stars exposed.
- Do you tuck the balls, too,
or just--
- You gotta tuck them balls,
girl?
- Yes.
- How do you tuck the balls?
- Well--
- Actually, I give a detailed
description in my book,
<i>Workin' It!,</i>
which is available on Amazon.
- You can definitely tell
Alaska has two feet,
but we embrace the two feet,
and we're trying to help her--
- The left--
Everyone has two feet.
Two left feet.
- Sorry, two left feet.
- This one.
Sharp as a knife.
- Anita, I think Coco's
in trouble.
- I think so too.
[laughs] If she had done what
Santiago had suggested--
- Or Santino.
- Or Santino.
- Oh, Santino, I'm sorry!
- Or Santino!
- And from the Fashion Police,
George Kotsiopoulos.
What are you gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?
'Cause my pussy's on fire.
[both laugh]
- It's "bro-cod," black
and with this gold,
horrible "bro-cod,"
but it's, like--
- Are you trying to say brocade?
- No, I say "bro-cod."
- It's brocade.
- Uh, in France, it's "bro-cod."
- It's fucking brocade.
- I don't care where the fuck
you went to school--
- It's brocade.
- Swear to God.
- They so crazy!
But nobody get it twisted
like my girls.
I try to raise them right,
but what you gonna do?
- Whoa!
- [laughs]
- I won the challenge!
- Oh, my God.
Not by my bag!
Not by my bag, not by my bag!
- Aah!
- Some of these girls
are cock-hungry dick pigs.
- I want to see Lineysha naked.
- Trade! Trade!
Come here and sit on my face,
bitch!
- They said, "What do you like
the best about the werk room?"
I said, "There's a lot
of naked men."
- Trade!
- Would they have to blur this?
- I made this for you.
- [laughs] That's wonderful!
- Do you see
what's happening there?
- Gay sex in the service!
- It's time to play America's
new favorite game,
"Cut or Uncut."
[laughter]
Blue! Not a match.
- I sucked.
- Oh, not a match.
- Well, I didn't suck.
I wanted to, but--
Sorry, Mr. Cameraman.
- She bring it
to you every ball.
Why y'all gagging so?
Did you understand that?
If not, you could use
a refresher course
in drag linguistics.
#ShitMyGirlsSay.
- Can you say "not on tonight,"
Miss Roxxxy?
- Not tonight.
- No.
"Not on tonight."
- That makes no sense, girl.
- "Mama, they ain't gonna be
able to read me.
Not on tonight."
Not on tonight.
Not on
tonight.
Not on tonight.
- I've had it.
I have had it.
I've had it, officially!
- Detox, I'ma need you to stop
playing with my outfit.
- Well, I'm gonna need you
to stop relying on your body.
[laughter]
- Whoo!
- Stop relying on that body.
- Stop relying
on that body.
- Stop relying on that body.
- Stop relying
on that body.
- Stop relying
on Sharon Needles.
- The time has come for our
next up close
and personal profile.
Top three queen, the sleeper
from Seattle--Jinkx Monsoon.
- Ow!
[laughter]
- At 14, Jinkx's drag career
started with a wig
her grandmother gave her.
- And I've had it ever since.
- She brought her show biz
skills to RuPaulywood.
- ♪ Can I get an amen ♪
- From the very start, Jinkx
kept getting the same criticism.
- It's rather pedestrian.
- But before you could say...
- Water off a duck's back.
Water off
a duck's back.
- Jinkx became a real contender.
[gasps]
- I love it!
- Ah!
- And her breakout performance
as Little Edie got everybody
talking.
- This is the revolutionary
costume for the day.
- From Snatch Game on,
Jinkx gained momentum.
-<i> Si, si, si!</i>
- But she nearly crashed
at the sugar ball.
At last week's courtroom,
she brought the drama, mama.
- You can't handle the "T"!
- And as one of the most
talented comedy queens ever,
Jinkx has stolen our hearts.
But can she mop the title
of America's Next Drag
Superstar?
What do you think?
Is it monsoon season?
Let us know.
Tweet us @RuPaulsDragRace,

Now, to find out what it means
to be the champion,
I've invited back our reigning
queen Sharon Needles.
- [laughing] Hi, Ru.
How are you?
- Now, everyone wants to know.
Who do you want to win?
- That's an obvious answer.
Lil' Pound Cake.
[both laughing]
- So if Alaska wins, can two
queens live happily ever after?
- Yeah, she spent a year
blowing my prize money.
So I would love to just get
a little bit of that back.
- Now, I wanna ask you
about winning,
and how has it changed
your life?
- This year has been
a nightmare, um, come true.
I've gotten to travel the world,
I've been the face of PETA,
I played Frank Furter in the
<i>Rocky Horror Picture Show,</i>
I came out with a whole album.
Um, what the crown can do
for you
is make all your dreams come
true if you let it.
- Yeah, wow.
- And it's been great to see
kids all over the world identify
with this, you know, kooky,
spooky, bat-shit crazy
drag queen
that I really thought would
just, uh, be making people
laugh in small bars
in Pittsburgh.
- Sharon, any words of wisdom
for America's Next
Drag Superstar?
- What other people think of you
ain't none
of your damn business.
- That's right.
- My advice, when in doubt,
freak 'em out.
And of course, what Lady Bunny
always says, "Retire!"
[both laughing]
- Oh, I almost forgot.
Do you have anything
to shamelessly plug?
- You can buy my album<i> PG-13</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
now available on iTunes.
Oh, and make sure to check out
all the fabulous music
that the<i> RuPaul Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girls</i>

<i>But she never lost her thick</i>
<i>and juicy personality.</i>
<i>She won the first main</i>
<i>challenge,</i>
<i>then formed the super group</i>
<i>Rolaskatox.</i>
<i>A true knockout, Roxxxy always</i>
<i>came out swinging,</i>
<i>on the runway</i>
<i>or in the werk room.</i>
- This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think--
- This competition
is extremely serious.
-<i> Roxxxy proved she could make</i>
<i>us laugh...</i>
- [with lisp] I am ready
to toss your salad, Anita.
Get your life.
-<i> Make us cry...</i>
- [crying]
-<i> And she could even make over</i>
<i>a soldier.</i>
<i>And in the music video,</i>

Don't mess with me, little boy.
And later, the music video world
premiere of<i> The Beginning.</i>
Don't move a love muscle because

is about to pop off.
[laughing]
[laughing]
Now, sometimes when you tuck
things away, they get lost,
especially if you've been
sitting all day.
But lucky for you,
the long-lost episode
of<i> Untucked</i>
has not only been found,
it's been restored,
filled with extra
dramatic sound effects,
and brought to us by its host:
the one and only RuPaul.
Hello, hello, hello.
My dear, you look gorgeous.
Oh, you.
So what do you got for us?
Girl, it's a doozy.
I can't wait.
Rupaul, is it true that you
never get to see<i> Untucked</i>
until the show airs?
Yes, I see it
when America sees it.
They shoot<i> Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> when the</i>
judges and I are deliberating.
So it's not like I can be
in two places at once.
Duh.
Duh!
Now, Ru, while I have you here,
fans are dying to know what was
up with your lighting, girl,
in season one?
We couldn't even see you, child.
"Exsqueeze" me?
And just how damn old are you?
Oh, it's gonna be like that,
huh?
Are those your real teeth?
Well, I bought 'em.
Hey, Urkel, uh, you trying to go
<i>Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on me right now?</i>
Don't mess with me, little boy.
Oh, no "T," no shade,
Miss Thing.
Let's keep it cute.
Yeah, uh-huh.
That's what I thought.
Now, without further ado,
for the first time anywhere,
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode.</i>
Welcome to<i> Untucked.</i>
This week, our top three queens
took it to court,
stating their cases for becoming
America's Next Drag Superstar.
- What they don't have,
I do have.
I have grace.
I have beauty.
I have professionalism.
- I was able to adapt and grow
while still being true
to who I am as a performer.
- Roxxxy was faced with
a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.
What did she present?
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.
And Jinkx Monsoon, she failed
three different looks.
-<i> Afterwards, Roxxxy, Alaska,</i>
<i>and Jinkx</i>
<i>headed to</i>
<i>the Interior Illusions Lounge</i>
<i>to have an Absolut cocktail</i>
<i>and let off some steam.</i>
- So how do y'all feel?
- Well, I wrote out the things
that I was gonna say
specifically about you two.
Then all of it seemed forced.
I was ready to tear down Roxxxy
and compare myself to Alaska.
But on the stage,
none of that seemed to matter.
- I knew exactly where I wanted
to go with it and made,
like, an outline.
But when I went to on the stage,
I was just coming
from the heart.
I made a choice not to call
everybody out on this runway
because doing that is not me.
- I just did the assignment.
I mean, we were supposed to,
like, cite exact things.
- Oh, Miss Thing.
Like, I could've sat there and
critiqued Jinkx and, you know,
critiqued Alaska
and these things--
I didn't wanna go there.
I just wanted to say--
- But I think that's
what they wanted us to do.
The assignment was specifically
not to give pageant answers.
Sorry, it's hard,
but it's our last challenge.
- I don't know.
I-I--all I could say was
that what I have,
you guys don't have, so--
- Like beauty and grace?
You said that onstage.
- No, I know.
- I may not have grace...
- [slurping]
- But I can possess beauty.
You can take a garbage bag
and be a fucking beauty queen.
You can be glamorous without,
like, 1,000 million stones
on your dress.
- It's just how I know
how to do drag.
Right now in the gold bar,
there's a lot of tension.
It was, once again,
my defense going up.
And I realized
that I owed them an apology.
This has been such
a learning experience.
In the pageant world, I feel
like I'm on top of my game.
And coming into this,
it's a whole nother story,
where you're up against
all these girls
that can beat you
at other things.
You're competing to be
the Next Drag Superstar.
And a superstar is not just
someone who can walk a runway
in a gown and be--
you know,
anybody can kinda do that.
- Except us.
- [laughs] Exc--
- Except you two 'cause you--
you can't possess it.
But, you know,
and anybody can do that.
And it's so much more than that.
- You know what's so funny,
is it has really been a similar
experience for me,
but in such a different way.
It got to a point where I felt
so attacked by other drag queens
because I have my own way
of doing things.
And then I come here,
and then all of a sudden
I'm not a pretty girl,
I'm the comedy girl.
Where back home, I'm, like, one
of the prettiest drag queens
there are.
- And I didn't have to bring it
up on the runway,
but I really
wanted to apologize for what
I said to you in the werk room.
It was being mean and--
and I didn't mean it.
- It meant something to me that
you apologized,
just so that our last
interaction together
didn't have to be a fight.
-<i> Wow. Bam, bam.</i>
Oops.<i> </i>
<i>Bam, bam.</i>
Oh!<i> </i>
<i>On fire.</i>
Oh!
You caught me playing
with myself.
I mean, playing my fabulous new
game,
the<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> edition</i>
of<i> Dragopolis,</i>
available May 6th for iPhone
and iPad on the App Store.
<i>Fierce!</i>
Now, which one
of my top three girls
is your Next Drag Superstar?
Are you Team Alaska, Team Jinkx,
or Team Roxxxy?
Don't go away.
Because we've got
the world premiere
of the music video
<i>The Beginning,</i>
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Countdown</i>
<i>to the Crown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
[whirring]
[laughing]
[laughing]
One week from tonight, herstory
will be made as we crown
America's Next Drag Superstar
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Who do you think deserves
to win...
the witty and wild Alaska...
- Hi-yee!
- This year's consummate
chameleon,
evolving at every turn?
Or the sleeper queen,
Jinkx Monsoon,
who brought Broadway brass
and vintage va-va-voom?
Or bronze bombshell
Roxxxy Andrews,
the queen of wham, bam,
thank you, glam?
I wanna hear from you.
Tweet us @RuPaulsDragRace.
Comment on Facebook and make
your voices heard everywhere.
Thanks to my countdown
correspondents,
Latrice, Willam,
and Sharon Needles.
And most of all,
I wanna thank you,
all my squirrel friends
out there watching at home.
We couldn't do it without you.
The world premiere of my new
music video<i> The Beginning</i>
is dedicated to you.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- That's right, baby.
Now let the music video play.
- These are serious allegations.
-<i> We have one thing to say.</i>
all: No comment.
[laughter]
- I plead innocent.
- I'm guilty of being fierce.
- You can't handle the "T."
- You're out of order.

- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Rolaskatox is Roxxxy,
Alaska, and Detox.
- I have narcolepsy.
[snores]
- You'll be writing
and recording
an inspirational anthem.
- Coco, there's a lot
of pressure on you
to start this out.
- Yeah.
Thanks, Detox.
- For what?
-<i> ♪ Can I get an amen ♪</i>
-<i> ♪ Just love yourself ♪</i>
- What's going on with you
and Detox?
- Rolaskatox.
- No!
Cliques can be dangerous.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- There was, like, 20 different
eras going on.
She's consistently a mess.
- This week's winner
is Ivy Winters.
- Thank you so much.
[giggles]
- Coco Montrese,
shantay, you stay.
Jade, sashay away.
- Thank you guys.
- Oh, Jade.
- "Cheers to my fish, fabulous,
and fierce sisters."
- We love you, Jade.
- Oh, God.
Bottom two twice.
I can't let Ru down anymore.
I'm not gonna take it
for granted anymore.
So you bitches
better look the fuck out.
- Oh!
- Ivy, you won your challenge.
- I know!
- Congratulations.
[cheers and applause]
- And you always look amazing
on the runway.
I had my fingers crossed I could
possibly win two challenges
in a row, but, I mean, Ivy,
it was very well-deserved.
- Jinkx likes to play
the "I think I did good,
"but I don't know.
They really hate my runways."
You're acting like
a little wounded girl,
and I'm fixing to call you out.
- Has everyone won
a challenge except--
have you won a challenge?
- Except me--a mini-challenge.
- And me, I haven't won.
- We're the only ones.
- It's just so hard
being here in Sharon's shadow.
She won four challenges.
This is not the place for me
to be supporting cast.
I have to show that I do
stand alone.
all: Rolaskatox.
- I don't want to be part of
Rolaskatox.
I want to be Alaska.
- The winner of<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> receives</i>
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour</i>
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight, extra special
guest judges Leslie Jordan
and Absolut's Jeffrey Moran.
- Rolaskatox.
- Rolaskatox.
It's a new day in the WERK room.
I know what I have to do,
and I'm gonna do it.
Alaska!
- What?
- Oh, she said Alaska.
Did your friend leave y'all?
- No more Rolaskatox?
- We can't do cliques.
It's too dangerous.
I guess it's just Rotox now.
It's hard to say
to Detox and Roxxxy
that I don't want to be
in this little girl group
that we had together.
- Ooh, she broke the group up.
- Smart girl.
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh!
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.
<i>Hey, queens.</i>
all: Hey.
<i>- It's feeding time.</i>
<i>So if you've got a beef,</i>
<i>it's time to start slinging</i>
<i>sass and serving insults.</i>
- Ah!
<i>- But never ever let them</i>
<i>see you choke.</i>
<i>[chokes]</i>
all: Uh-oh!
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru!
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Ladies, in the great
tradition of<i> Paris is Burning,</i>
get ready to visit the library,
darlings.
[cheers and applause]
Because reading is what?
all: Fundamental!
- That's right, that's right.
First up, Detox, the library
is open.
- Oh.
Roxxxy Andrews, condragulations
on the weight loss, but to me,
you're still Boxxxy Mandrews.
[all laugh]
Alyssa Edwards.
Overbites are very "in"
this season.
Too bad your performance here
is so underwhelming.
- Oh-oh!
- [laughs]
- Sharon Needles--what? No?
[all laugh]
I've had it.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Roxxxy Andrews, there are
two types of peanut butter,
creamy and crunchy.
[all laugh]
- I'm not crunchy, baby.
- Detox, you won the challenge.
You can take the chicken mask
off now.
[all laugh]
- [clucking]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Coco Montrese, for someone
who calls themself a top,
you sure do like
being on the bottom.
- Ooh!
[all laugh]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
You're great at the challenges,
but on the runway,
you're a bust.
[all laugh]
- Detox, is Amanda Lepore
your mother?
'Cause there's a lot of silicone
going on there.
- Ooh.
- Jinkx Monsoon,
Boy George called.
He wants his hat back.
- [gasps]
- Ooh.
- Alyssa Edwards.
Never mind.
all: Ooh!
- Ivy Winters.
I can't do it
because reading you
is like reading
a Walt Disney book.
It's simply too easy.
[all laugh]
Detoxic.
Honey, I know you think
you're serving body and look,
but the only thing I'm getting
is<i> The Hills Have Eyes.</i>
- Uh-oh.
- Ms. Coco.
You must be blind
because it looks like
you're using Tang
for your highlights.
- [laughs]
- Aah!
- Ms. Alaska, I think you should
wear a mask
for every challenge.
- [laughs]
I don't want to read
these girls.
I love them so mu--all right,
let's go.
[all laugh]
Alyssa Edwards, Miss USA--
Oh, wait.
[all gasp]
- Why are you laughing?
- Detox, you're so seductive,
but unfortunately, it's illegal
to do it with you
because most of your parts
are under 18 years of age.
[all laugh]
Long story short, the season of
the fish smells like trout.
[all laugh]
I don't know what came over me.
- The library
is now officially closed.
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...
Alaska.
[applause]
- Whoo!
- You shady bitch.
Ladies, for this week's
main challenge,
you're going to get
a chance to read...
me.
[all shout]
- Nuh-uh.
- You'll be competing
in the RuPaul Roast.
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- Proudly presented by Absolut.
Over 30 years ago, Absolut Vodka
was one of the first spirits
to support the gay and lesbian
community.
They were also the first
to launch
a citron and a mandarin vodka,
making the world
a fruitier place,
one cocktail at a time.
Now in that spirit, you need to
write and perform
outrageous material that really
lets me have it...
plus the judges...
plus each other.
No one's safe at a roast,
chickens.
Now to help you prepare,
you'll be working with
three professionals:
the shelarious Nadya Ginsburg...
- [gasps]
- Deven Green...
- Oh!
- And the one and only
Bruce Vilanch.
[all cheering]
- Alaska, you won the
mini-challenge,
so you'll decide the order
of the presenters.
- Oh.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Does anyone have a preference
as to going early, late?
'Cause I don't want to fuck
anyone over.
- I would prefer to go
just in the middle.
- In the middle? Okay.
- Me too, in the middle
for me too.
- I want to go after you.
- Where are you
putting yourself?
- No one wants to go first.
But, I mean, I don't mind
going first.
Is that okay?
- Yeah.
- That's the hardest one.
Wrong move.
- This challenge is important
because everyone knows me
as a comedy queen.
So there's high pressure
right now
to put my money
where my mouth is.
- It's so hard to think of,
like, mean things to say
about her.
- Ivy's very sweet
and well-mannered.
And in a roast,
that's gonna be hard.
- I am just trying to, like,
really rack my brain.
And I still can't think
of one joke.
- Coming up...
- I put myself first.
- Are you going for
Miss Congeniality
or America's next
drag superstar?
- Girl, that's fake to me.
- I'm not acting when I say
I'm insecure about things.
- Bullshit.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- The main challenge this week
is to roast RuPaul,
as well as our fellow queens
and the judging panel.
I just have to kick ass at it,
because at a drag show,
when you bomb,
you don't just hear crickets.
You hear shotguns
getting cocked.
- I can't read this last one.
Because they're gonna be like,
t--
Humph.
- I keep hearing, "Ooh!"
- Oh, my gosh.
- "Ooh, um--"
- [mutters]
- "Oh, no, I can't."
- Oh, my gosh, y'all.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna have to rewrite it.
I'm gonna read y'all
the beginning of mine.
Tell me if it's too much.
"RuPaul, where should I start?
"With the cracked-out
beginning of your career
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance?"
Oh, my gosh.
Y'all, am I just gonna be too--
Is that too much, Roxxxy?
[laughs]
[rubs hands together]
- She's saying her jokes
are so much
and she says her joke, bitch,
and you can hear crickets.
- I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
- You go back in your corner,
and you figure it the fuck out
and come back and talk to us
when you got
something together.
Darling.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all shout]
- Oh, my!
- No, no, no.
- Since nobody knows RuPaul
better than me,
I am here to help you all
with your roast material.
- Oh, my God.
- Hello, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Tell me what you got.
You're a smart one.
- Well, I'm hitting her music,
her movies--
- What about the music?
- Ru, your music
is so auto-tuned
you make Cher sound like
Susan Boyle.
- [laughs]
Good.
It's so nice to see Alaska
again.
- Hi.
- Now, you won
the mini-challenge.
- Yes.
- So you were in charge
of the order.
- Mm-hmm.
- So how did you decide how
everybody was gonna go?
- I asked everyone if they have
a preference
as to if they want to
go in the beginning,
the middle, the end.
And I put myself first.
- Yeah, are--are you going for
Miss Congeniality
or America's
next drag superstar here?
- Um--
- In the end, someone's gotta
go down, right?
- Yeah.
- It could be you.
See you at the roast, baby.
Hi, Roxxxy girl.
- Hi, Michelle.
- Does this challenge
make you nervous?
- Reading is something
I've always done
to the queens at the bar.
You know, they think I'm a mean
girl anyways, but--
- How do you plan on reading
somebody like Ru?
- Her music, how she sings.
- How does she sing?
- It's auto-tune.
- Auto-tune seems to be
a common thing so far.
So you might want to listen,
and if something's repeated,
take it out or make it funnier--
- Than the person before you.
- Yes.
- And I can be funnier
than Alaska.
- [gasps]
- [laughs]
- Keep it funny.
That's all we can tell you.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?
- A little bit nervous,
to be honest.
I don't consider myself
a comedian,
so it's definitely
a challenge for me.
- What kind of topics are you
gonna be roasting Ru on?
- I know he wears
amazing costumes,
so I think I'm gonna
kind of hit on that.
- How are Ru's dresses funny?
I mean, they're flawless.
Give me another one.
- Um, I know Santino being
a sewer and he designs, um--
- Some sewing jokes?
Doesn't sound too funny.
Your page is empty.
- I think I've ripped out,
like, five pages.
I'm really trying to rack
my brain.
- Keep racking.
I'm gonna let you back at it.
Keep on keeping on, baby.
- All right.
- Coco Montrese.
Hi, gorgeous.
- How are you?
- How are you feeling about
this challenge?
- I'm not a comedian by--
by far,
but I'm taking a different
approach than, you know,
a lot of the other girls
in this competition.
I'm gonna be Coco Montrese,
Ru's old childhood friend
from the Brewster Projects.
- Okay.
I think it's important for you,
this challenge, Coco.
- Very.
I've been in the bottom twice.
- So let's deliver
this shit.
- I will deliver.
- All right.
- Thanks.
No RuPaulogies.
I'm not gonna apologize anymore.
I'm gonna show him
what I'm made of.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- Miss Michelle,
the first lady, how are you?
- I love it.
Are you a funny queen, Alyssa?
- With reading, some people
can take it personal.
- Okay, they can take it
personally if it's not funny.
But if it's funny,
you're almost forgiven.
It's, like, given a pass.
- Right.
But you know when you're with
your friends, and you're like,
"Girl, that outfit is tired
and ridiculous.
You look late.
Bitch, you need to go change."
- That's not a joke.
That's a read.
- It is, but it's still
being funny.
- It's not a joke.
- Not a joke, no.
And I've taken it personal
before because I had a girl
in this competition tell me
I was fat in my costume.
- It's not a joke.
Gotta be funny.
- Okay.
- It has to be joke after joke
after joke.
All right, so I'm gonna let you
go back to your work.
- Okay, thank you, Michelle.
- All right, baby.
Good luck.
All right, ladies.
Gather round.
In a moment, you'll be meeting
with your comedy coaches.
And tomorrow we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judges,
star of TV and stage,
Leslie Jordan...
[all cheer]
And Absolut Vodka guru,
Jeffrey Moran.
- Oh, yay.
- So come decked out in
your swankiest cocktail attire.
Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be roasting Ru
in front of a live audience.
- Oh, my gosh!
[all shout]
- Oh, shut up!
- So don't fuck it up.
Byesies.
- Bye.
- [snores]
I do have narcolepsy,
and in the moment where I'm most
worried about my jokes,
my body
starts to shut down.
- You might think I want to say
"Jinkx, wake up."
But sorry, girl.
- [snores]
- Coming up...
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up?
[laughs]
- It has to be funny.
Seriously.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Jinkx is here.
- Hi, Jinkxy.
- Hi, Jinkx.
- Our coaches today are
Deven Green, Bruce Vilanch,
and Nadya Ginsburg.
I am most shaken by Deven Green.
I have been doing her "welcome
to my home" video shtick
for years.
So I'm just gonna rattle through
all of this.
- Cool.
- RuPaul, you are pulled--
[clears throat]
RuPaul in her heyday would have
made--ah.
I ruined it.
- Stop being such an adult,
and be a fun-loving performer.
- Okay.
My career as a comedian
might be on the line here.
- RuPaul, how do you get to be
supermodel of the world?
When you find out,
can you let me know?
- Well, that is a starting point
for somewhere
that you didn't go.
Just go deeper, as somebody
once said to me
who I never dated again.
- Don't be afraid to go out
there and really be as vicious
as you can because that's
the name of the game.
- I would write that down.
It's a great note.
- I'm writing that down.
- Let's talk about
Michelle Visage.
Everybody, Michelle Visage.
She's lovely.
Who did your boob job, Michelle?
Boobsforqueens.com?
They--they do breast plates
for drag queens.
- I think you need something
a little easier to process.
Just make sure you really
drive it home.
- Coco!
- Tomorrow I'm just going with
I'm Ru good friend
from the projects.
Ru don't know I'm gonna be here.
You know, straight from
the hood.
It's gonna be a stretch for me.
- [laughs]
- All right.
- I'ma say, "you know, Ru,
"I want to know
what you gonna do
"when that entourage of makeup
artists you got go on strike.
I seen you do your makeup
by yourself, fool."
- I would be mindful of--
it should be light-hearted,
not malicious and mean-spirited.
- Like her face has been beat
more times than Susan Lucci
at the Daytime Emmys.
- Right.
- Coco is not a comedian.
But RuPaul's long lost friend
from the Brewster Projects
is a comedian.
She tell it like it t-i-is.
And she ain't apologizing for it
while she pat her weave.
- Okay, Mr. RuPaul Charles.
After your less award-earning
role in<i> Starrbooty,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
you should not only sashay away,
but jump off a damn cliff.
[laughs]
- I think the general rule
in a roast is
it's great to be evil,
but it has to be funny.
You gotta have a couple of
jokes, seriously.
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up
with your
no-drag-knowledge mouth?
[laughs]
- Do you have any more jokes?
- [chuckles]
- I'll just start with my whole
spiel about Leslie Jordan.
The movie<i> The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is chock-full</i>
of unbelievable performances.
The most unbelievable is you
being a heterosexual.
Leslie, you're gayer than George
Michael fucking Elton john.
- It's important
that you not rush.
Take your time.
- And find the funniest nugget.
Take it even one step further
with some of the punch lines.
- Ru and the rest of the judges
are expecting a lot out of me.
I have to be funny.
- Roxxxy.
Let's hear your material.
- Okay, let's start with Ru.
Your laugh is as fake as
Lee Press-On Nails.
They're sticky, annoying,
and never fun.
Then again,
so is Alyssa Edwards.
- What do you call it
when you flatline?
- You're dead.
- Code blue.
- Thank you.
More, more.
What else do you have?
- Yeah, what else--what are
your other jokes?
- Okay, the other one I have for
Ru is
"Ru, your acting to me
is very cute.
Unlike all the girls that are
left in this competition."
- Well, that's--
it's not really funny.
It's just an insult.
- When the coaches completely
rejected what I was giving them,
it threw me, and I'm completely
defeated.
Like, first joke off the bat
was just, like,
"Oh, mm, you're not
making us laugh.
Okay, what else do you have?"
And I was like...
I'm, like, redoing my whole
script right now.
That was the first time I just
wanted, like, to leave and cry.
It sucks.
[sighs]
- Today we will be roasting
the legendary Ms. RuPaul.
Not only am I nervous
that we're doing comedy,
but it's in front of
a live audience.
Honey, tonight I am shaking
in my pumps.
- Ms. Jinkx standing over there
looking like the mad hatter
right now.
What's this challenge?
<i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- Coco, why are you still doing
your ventriloquist dummy makeup?
all: Ooh!
- Jinkx try to act like
she innocent
and that she's not reading.
- I don't act
like I'm innocent.
- Now, Ms. Jinkx, I want to ask
you this for real, girl.
Do you feel like you deliver
glamour?
- I don't think I deliver
anything but what I deliver.
And what I've been delivering
lately
has been a big, old confusion.
- That's all bullshit.
I'm not believing that.
- You ain't buyin', Ms. Roxxxy?
She's sellin', and you ain't
buyin'?
- I ain't buyin' shit.
You come across as
"I don't think I'm gonna win,
but I'm just here doing good
until I can't do good anymore."
- I feel like sometimes when I
do well in the challenges,
I don't really get to feel
that great about it
because I get
beat down on the runway.
It's my own thing I'm tackling.
- Girl, that's fake to me.
You know what you can do,
but you play the card
as the innocent,
"I don't know.
Maybe I'm in the bottom two."
And I feel like, you know--
- Yeah, it's just like,
really, girl?
- I'm not acting when I say I'm
insecure about things, though.
- Ms. Jinkx, you know exactly
what I'm saying,
you know
what role you're playing.
- I know what you're saying,
and I do not agree with you.
It is not an act when I tell you
I'm nervous about shit.
That's how I feel.
- Okay, well, girl,
if you're not gonna take
the constructive criticism
and how I'm just trying to
explain to you how I feel.
- Many jokes and two faces...
- Ooh!
- Jinkx Monsoon!
- [laughs]
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, are you ready
for some roasting?
- Bring it on, bitches.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice.
- I am ready to get ribbed for
her pleasure.
- [laughs]
Leslie Jordan, are you scared
just a little bit?
- Terrified.
- Good. You should be.
Absolut's Jeffrey Moran,
what flavor of Absolut
would this be?
- Absolut Pears in the
Garden of Good and Evil.
- Mm, evil.
This week we challenged
our queens
to sharpen their comedic skills
in the first ever
RuPaul Roast.
So enjoy your Absolut cocktails,
and remember, if you can't laugh
at yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna laugh at somebody else?
[laughs]
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Coming up...
- You know at the beginning
of the show
you come in the room, girl,
pants so high.
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[all laugh]
- [laughs]
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, everyone, and welcome
to the first ever RuPaul Roast.
[cheers and applause]
You all know Leslie Jordan.
[cheers and applause]
Don't lie.
No, you don't.
[all laugh]
Leslie Jordan is the only man
on earth
to have fucked more gay men
than Michelle Visage.
[all laugh]
Michelle Visage.
You can take the girl
out of New Jersey,
but you can't keep the girl
from giving blow jobs
to homeless men
along the New Jersey turnpike.
But we're here
celebrating RuPaul.
RuPaul, you've been
in the industry
a long, long, long, long, long,
long, long time.
RuPaul is so old that
the Hindenburg disaster
nearly destroyed
her bat mitzvah.
[all laugh]
RuPaul is so old that her
colostomy bag is made of wood.
[all laugh]
RuPaul is so old that
when she opens her legs,
all you hear is--
[raspy exhale]
[all laugh]
She's done movies, music,
television,
and I have just one thing
to say.
Please stop immediately.
[all laugh]
Thank you, mama.
We love you.
[cheers and applause]
It is my great pleasure
to bring to the stage
our next "entertainer."
Roxxxy Andrews.
And that's Roxxxy with three Xs,
just like her dress size.
- Oh!
- Thank you, Alaska...
a tired, boring, weird,
second-rate version
of your husband.
[audience ohs]
You know, RuPaul, you love it
for all of us
to call you our mom.
How the fuck
can I call you my mom
if you're as old
as my grandpa?
[faint laughter]
Michelle Visage,
with that much makeup,
all of your wigs, and...
light on your face,
maybe we should call you...
Michelle Mirage.
[scattered laughter]
RuPaul, I want to thank you
for having me here tonight.
- Y'all, I'm so happy
to be here.
I never been out the house.
It's been a long time, y'all.
I'm Ru good cousin
from the Brewster Projects.
She didn't know I was
coming tonight.
You didn't know I was gonna be
here, did you?
- [laughs] No.
- And Michelle--you go back
with Michelle
farther than you go back
with me.
You knew Michelle when Michelle
was Michael.
[all laugh]
So I'm flipping through the
channels, I say, "You seen Ru?
Ru on TV!"
I say, "What the hell is he
thinking?"
You know, at the beginning
of the show,
you come in the room, girl.
"Hello, hello!"
Girl, you look like the black
Pee Wee Herman.
[all laugh]
Pants so high.
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[riotous laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- It's gonna be hard to top
Coco.
But look at her.
Who would want to top Coco?
[all laugh]
Michelle Visage is so full
of semen.
Period.
[all laugh]
No, seriously.
She's a whore.
Now on to the grand
high bitch herself.
Ru, what I admire most about you
is your ability
to look at these tired queens
and always find
a compliment for them.
You're so full of shit,
the toilet's jealous.
[all laugh]
Give it up for RuPaul.
- Hello, everyone.
Having sex with Santino is a lot
like Ru's music career...
Awkward.
- You would know.
- [laughs]
- I feel like
whenever Michelle farts,
a fairy gets her wings.
[all laugh]
Speaking of fairies,
hello, Leslie.
RuPaul, with these long legs
and feathers you like to wear,
you're one step away
from looking like
Big Bird's grandmother.
[audience oohs]
[cheers and applause]
- I thought I had auditioned
for<i> RuPaul's Next--</i>
[microphone feedback]
<i>Drag queen of the year.</i>
[microphone feedback]
Little did I know I was walking
into the largest cross-dressing
convention of all time.
[scattered laughter]
But this is about you,
mother Ru...
From the cracked-out nights
in the bathroom
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance.
This was the best bunch
of people
you could get to come judge?
Can I get a gay man?
Santino Rice, what the hell you
know about winning something?
But you and Coco Montrese do
share something in common, okay.
And that's not only
your foolish wardrobe,
but being a runner-up--
- Oh...
- Don't get bitter.
Just get better.
[microphone feedback]
I thank you, and good night.
[applause]
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Wasn't he delightful?
[all laugh]
God bless him,
he tried his hardest.
Oh, fuck.
Where do I fucking start?
Oh, God.
Let's start with Leslie Jordan.
It's great to see you.
[chuckles]
<i>The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is one of my most</i>
favorite movies of all time.
And your performance
was quite unbelievable.
Because you played
a heterosexual male.
You are fucking gayer than the
Fire Island production of<i> Rent.</i>
[all laugh]
But enough with that old queen.
Let's talk about the other
old queen on the panel,
Michelle Visage.
[all laugh]
Let me just look at my little
notes really quick, fuck.
God, I had to write little
to fit all this in.
[laughter]
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Michelle's favorite movie in the
world is<i> Showgirls.</i>
And much like Nomi Malone,
she relies on the talents
of her black friend.
[all laugh]
Ru, you are a fucking legend.
And I just hope that you're
having the time of your life.
Because you don't have much time
left.
[all laugh]
Good night, you guys.
Thank you so much
for coming out.
[cheers and applause]
- Coming up...
- You were trying too hard.
- It was boring,
it was humiliating,
and uncomfortable to watch.
- Wah-wah.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Ladies, it's time for the
judges' critiques.
Let's start with Alaska.
- Hi.
- Comedy is like music.
It's something you hear
or you don't.
And you definitely
hear the music.
- Thank you.
- I thought you looked
beautiful tonight in your LBD.
And up there at the podium,
you were very funny,
but it's tough to go first.
You really should have taken it
even further.
- Moving on to Ivy Winters.
- Hey.
- We both wore green.
- I know.
- Yeah.
- You wore it best.
- [laughs]
- Tonight--I love you in green,
I love the red hair.
Not sure about the gloves.
- I love the gloves.
- I don't think you need them.
- During the roast, your
cards were a bit of a crutch,
and you kept looking at them.
- And you seemed
so unsure of yourself.
You were so nervous.
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- You have a career in or out
of drag in comedy.
You killed.
- Thank you.
- Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.
Let's start with
the runway look...
I love it!
- [laughs]
- Right hair, right makeup.
I am so friggin' proud of you.
- To hear that from
Michelle Visage, oh, my God,
that was worth its weight
in gold.
- Detox.
- Hi.
- You were so mean to me.
But there was a twinkle
in your eye.
Your tongue was firmly planted
in your cheek.
- The one thing I wasn't fond of
was you relying too much
on the word "fuck."
You can let the room breathe.
It's okay.
It was too much.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- You could have been
a little funnier.
And I thought you were trying
too hard.
- Going into the mic
and holding on, like,
for dear life,
I thought that was nerves.
But you're so gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- It wasn't your best moment
tonight.
- Okay.
- It was boring.
It was humiliating
and uncomfortable to watch.
- Coco Montrese.
- Not a roast, but a toast.
Mazel tov.
It was really spectacular.
- Thank you.
- Well done.
- Wanda Sykes, move over.
[all laugh]
It was hilarious.
- Tonight on the runway,
I like your look.
I'm thinking the earrings
and your roots showing,
it added to the humor.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Keep your pace up.
You needed to be quicker.
- It wasn't as smooth.
You could have strung it
together better
so that it was
much more fluid.
- Tonight your dress
is high-end,
and you really needed
some bigger hair to go with it.
- Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Just between us roasted
chickens, what do you think?
Let's start with Alaska.
- Her look
is so predictable now.
- So you want to see
a different silhouette.
- Just once at least.
- Being first means you have
a little more expectation
to step out of the box.
But a lot of the things,
it's like, I sort of expected
them.
- I just loved her.
She just, like, the kind of
knock-kneed,
and standing back there
and quirky and--
[exaggerated laugh]
It was refreshing to me.
- Moving on to Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy sees herself
as not funny,
and I think she was too much
in her head,
trying to
think how she can deliver it.
- And she seemed to be
out of character.
- I'd agree.
Roxxxy was stumbling from one
transition to the next.
It wasn't her night.
- She was really, really,
really nervous.
And I think it was just
a meltdown,
and it's hard to watch that.
- All right.
- Ivy Winters.
- She read her cards
the whole time.
She didn't connect once.
I didn't see her eyes.
I got no emotion from her.
And that's been my problem
with Ivy.
She's like a cardboard cutout.
- I didn't have a problem with
Ivy in that way, Michelle.
She wasn't as rough as some of
the other girls
with segueing from one joke
to the next,
and there was some really funny
moments.
- Coco Montrese.
- Great concept,
great delivery.
Very good tonight for Coco.
Especially coming from where
she was last week.
- Coco came out here tonight
with a new attitude.
She had consistent joke
after joke.
- I almost fell off the chair.
The whole time she was up there,
she stayed in that character.
I died.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Hallelu.
She looked great.
I was so very proud of her.
- I would have loved her
to have played more
with the other queens.
Reading them a little more.
Yes.
- I have two words:
master comedienne.
- All right, next up, Detox.
- We all know she's funny.
She could have done more and got
rid of some of the f-bombs.
- You know, the f-bomb
usually means
that someone's very nervous.
- You can laugh, but it's like,
oh, and another f-bomb,
oh, and another f-bomb.
And it's no longer funny
or bombastic.
- I expected more from her.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- The dress was a disaster
tonight.
I got prom feeling from it.
And then the roast--
wah-wah.
Intimidation.
- Yeah, that was it.
- Was she intimidated
by the other girls?
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- So many funny girls
up there tonight.
- They were--they were funny,
and I think she just--
she melted.
But I think she's beautiful.
- [laughs]
- She looks like
a fairy prince.
[all laugh]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
[laughs]
- [laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Alaska, tonight you proved
you can stand on your own.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
[blows kiss]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
your look tonight was no joke.
Keep it up.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Coco Montrese.
As my hood rat cousin,
you tore me to shreds.
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Condragulations.
[applause]
You've won a custom gown
from SequinQueen.
- Coco Montrese is back.
Yes, God, I'm back, baby.
- Detox...
you're safe.
Alyssa Edwards,
tonight your punch lines
flatlined.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Ivy Winters, you struggled
to connect with the audience.
Roxxxy Andrews, tonight was not
your shining moment.
Ivy Winters...
you're safe.
Roxxxy Andrews, I'm sorry,
my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- All of this stress
has just hit me.
This is honestly the first time
in this competition
that I felt
"You're not good enough."
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.
- Get ready for the lip sync
of your life.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

Go ahead.
- No, tell me about it.
- It just hit me and...
like not feeling wanted
and not being good enough.
I just feel like my mom
never wanted me and--
my mother left my sister
and myself at a bus stop
when I was three.
And I remember it like it was
yesterday.
And, like, I come off
as this strong character.
I try to stay so strong,
but I'm so weak,
and I'm so tired.
[sobbing]
It just hurts that I was left.
Nobody cared.
- We love you.
And you are so welcome here.
You know, we as gay people,
we get to choose our family.
You know, we get to choose
the people that we're around.
You know what I'm saying?
I am your family.
We are a family here.
I love you.
- I love you.
- All right.
I've made my decision.
What you two did on this runway
is the passion
I am looking for.
Shantay, you both stay.
- [cries]
- [cries]
- Thank you so much.
- These are no longer just drag
queens I am competing with.
I'm growing attached
to these people.
We are like the seven sisters
right now.
- My seven sister queens.
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen!

- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you get to enlist these men
into your drag house.
- Oh, shit.
I've never done anyone else's
makeup.
- You are going to be with
Roxxxy Andrews.
- I think it was sabotage.
It pissed me off.
[drum line playing]

- You made a gown for yourself,

the scraps that were kind of
left over.

And after four lip syncs,
Coco is finally gone.
all: "I love you all.
Give them hell, girls."
- I plan on it.
- We love you, coquito.
- I think that her purpose here
was to get that whole Alyssa
and her thing accomplished and,
like, out of the way.
And I think that after she got
that, she was kind of just like,
"That's what I needed."
Coco Montrese was here because
she needed closure with Alyssa.
And you know what?
I'm here to be America's next
drag superstar.
- How about you, Miss Winner?
- Congratulations.
- I won a challenge, yay!
Day one, we walked in here as
Rolaskatox.
And, girl, here we stand with
little Jinkx.
No offense, Jinkx.
- Jinkx--it's like "Rolaskatox!
And Jinkx."
- Rolaskatox and Jinkx.
This is my worst nightmare
come true.
If one of them is given
the opportunity
to sell someone down the river,
they're gonna choose me.
- I have to go plot against
you guys.
- I need to go burn
Jinkx's costumes
from the '40s and
the '50s and the '30s.

- It's the top four.
We're a millimeter away from
being the top three.
And if I have to inch my way to
the top three, I'll do that.
And I deserve it.
It's so crazy

I've had it with you guys
not lip-syncing at all.

Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- You know, every now and then,
a drag queen needs to get things
off her chesticles.
So for today's mini challenge,
we're gonna have a good
old-fashioned bitch-fest.
And we're gonna do it with
puppets.
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- Why?
all: Everybody loves puppets!
- First, pick a puppet
that represents one of your
competitors.
Second, drag it up.
Third, you and the puppet have
a bitch-fest.
- [giggles]
- Detox, you're up first.
I want you to reach deep inside,
and I don't mean the pit crew's
Andrew Christian underwear.
- Oh, man.
Ooh, it's so squishy.
Alaska!
- Next up, Alaska.
- Isn't this a little high?
- Oh, my goodness.
It's like<i> A Fist called Wanda.</i>

It'll be so easy.

On your mark, get set, go!

- I find the rattiest, dirtiest
blonde wig I can find,
then spray-adhesiving it
and rubbing it together,
making it matty and gross.
- I hate you, Detox.

- This is my opportunity to
make fun of Jinkx Monsoon.

- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
Let the bitch-fest begin.
- Detox, it's time to come out.
[as Detox] I've had it.
[normal voice] Detox, come out.
[as Detox] Fuck.
[laughter]
[as Detox] You ever been blown
by a girl with silicon lips?
I call it a slip 'n slide.
I mean, I just want to put my
mouth on it and go like this:
[babbling]
Meh!
[laughter]
- I don't know where she picked
up that slip 'n slide joke.
I've never said that.
I always call my mouth "my Black
&amp; Decker pecker wreckers."
- [as Detox] I've had it.
I've had it. I've had it.
- [laughs]
- [as Alaska]
Detox, I'm so upset.
[normal voice] Why, Alaska?
You look so gorgeous.
[as Alaska] But I don't have
any nice shoes!
Sharon got all the money, and I
can't get anything for myself.
Aah!
[normal voice] My whole idea was
to make her really whiny,
'cause Alaska has this kind of
whiny voice.
[as Alaska] Wah!
[normal voice] Okay, you need to
pull it together,
you bowlegged
fucking son of a bitch.
I've had it with you.
[laughter]
- Jinkx, girl, it's time for
the runway.
[as Jinkx] [snoring]
Jinkx?
Jinkx.
[as Jinkx] [snoring]
Huh? Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Do I look okay?
Can you guys help me with
my makeup?
Michelle told me that my cheeks
were too much.
Is this too much?
Is the blend okay?
[regular voice] So, Jinkx,
you think you're America's next
drag superstar.
[as Jinkx] You know, I try to
seem so innocent all the time,
but I'm really a bitch.
And I'm here to win,
and you guys have no idea.
[normal voice] Okay, Jinkx,
I've had enough.
You can go home.
[as Jinkx] Anyone know which way
Seattle is?
This way.
- That was rude.
- That wasn't rude.
- The shade of it all.
- Roxxxy, you look amazing.
Where'd you get your outfit?
[as Roxxxy] Same place I always
get my outfit, girl.
I made it ten minutes before I
got on the runway.
Hey!
Where my people at?
[normal voice] Oh, my god--
Roxxxy, I don't think that wig
is really working with this
outfit.
[as Roxxxy] That's okay, y'all.
I got another wig underneath!
[laughter]
[normal voice] I'm clocking
that tear-away.
[as Roxxxy]
Girl, I got a tear-away
underneath my tear-away!
- [laughs]
- A swimsuit!
Hey!
Where my people at?
Where my people at?
- Yeah, bitch, you better keep
repeating that,
'cause America's gonna know.
When they buy that song
on itunes,<i> Can I Get a Amen?,</i>
they're gonna say,
"Where my people at?"
- Wow, you girls didn't pull
any punches.
But one of you really made your
fellow queen eat it.
The winner is...
Alaska.
- [as Roxxxy] Hey!
Hey!
Where my people at?
- Ladies, I hope you left room
for dessert,
because for this week's
main challenge,
we're throwing the first ever...
[echoes] Sugar Ball.
You'll each need to whip up
three luscious looks.
First category is...
Super Duper Sweet 16,
teenage party girl.
Second category is Sugar Mama,
executive realness.
Third category is the tastiest
of them all,
Candy Couture.
- Ooh!
- Edible eleganza.
You'll be making high-calorie
fashion
using these sticky and
sweet confections
provided by Candy Warehouse.
Alaska, you won
the mini challenge,
so you get
a 15-second head start.
Go.
[upbeat music]
♪ ♪
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Ooh!
- This challenge is about
sewing and creating.
Aah, my balls!
These bitches don't know how
to sew.
This is my element of drag.
- Does everyone know
what kind of direction
they're gonna go in?
- I know exactly the direction
I'm going in.
- Do you?
- Yes.
I'm going Alexander McQueen
does Christmas.
[chuckles]
- Girl, she's going for
a winter wonderland look, bitch.
- It looks crazy.
Just 'cause you throw some
antlers on your goddamn head
and you call it
an Alexander McQueen look?
Good luck, Jinkx.
- Coming up...
- I've fucking had it.
- Girl, could you please stop
banging?
- Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- [laughing]
[techno music]
- This week's main challenge
is the first ever Sugar Ball,
where we have to create three
different looks--
a Sweet 16 party girl look,
a Sugar Mama executive realness
look,
and a Candy Couture
fashion look.
- I'm gonna eat
my entire costume.
- Alaska, do I remind you
of someone?
- Detox!
- They're not that big of
a stretch, really.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi.
all: Hello.
- How are things going here
on the good ship<i> Lollipop?</i>
- Delish.
- Alaska.
- Hi.
- I came over to borrow a pair
of edible panties.
May I eat this pair?
- You can eat those shorts
all day.
- Oh, wait.
These aren't edible.
[sniffs]
Ew!
- Ew!
- [laughs]
Now I want to hear all about
your Candy Couture look.
- I like, like,
fluffy cotton candy.
- How are you putting the candy
on there?
It's just glued, right?
- Yeah, it's hot glue.
- Huh, interesting.
But you've been criticized
for being a little rough
around the edges.
You know, the stakes
are very high.
And you've really got to wow us
to get into that top three.
All right.
Can't wait to see it.
Hi, Jinkx.
You're not known for being
a seamstress.
- No.
- What are you doing?
- Well, I want to do, like,
Christmas in July candy cane
reindeer monster kind of thing.
- Wait now.
Say that again slower for me,
because I'm trying to get that
all up in there.
- Christmas in July candy cane
reindeer monster.
- Do you think it's too much,
though?
This your Candy Couture look.
- Yes.
- But where's the candy?
- Well, I'm going to look like
a candy cane overall.
- It's a candy challenge.
Where the candy at?
- And I'm very excited to give
the Sweet 16 a shot.
- Now, you know we're not
talking 1916, right?
- [laughs] Yeah.
Is it okay if I'm sweet 16
but in the '70s?
- Well, the judges have
challenged you
to be a little more, you know,
modern, contemporary.
Good luck.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- So how are you gonna bring it
for your Candy Couture?
What do you have planned?
- I'm so in love
with acid green,
and I really want to do some
reptilian-looking...
- Uh-huh.
- Funk.
I don't know what I'm thinking
of yet, but I see it in my head.
- Detox's concept right now
is more based on a color.
I'm not seeing the candy
inspiration in it.
- I'm just trying to play it
all by ear.
- Well, now, looking
around the room,
it looks like you're
a little bit behind.
Now, last week, you were
in the bottom two.
- I know.
- There's a certain expectation
that, um, really just hasn't
been met.
I don't know what to say
about that.
- Right. I don't--
I don't either, honestly.
- Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- It's kind of like a slap
in the face.
Of course I want to be America's
next drag superstar.
That's what I want.
It's something
that I've always wanted.
- All right, get to work.
See you in a minute.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Hey, Ru.
- Now, top four,
every moment counts.
- It's $100,000 at stake here.
- $100,000 at stake.
- And that's no game.
It's gonna be a fight
till the end, baby.
- So tell me about your
Candy Couture outfit.
- My Candy Couture,
I'm going very extravagant,
very extravaganza.
- Now, how's your body-ody-ody
gonna play into this outfit?
- Well, it's a corset,
so I kind of brought it up
over here
so that you could still get
a shape on that side,
a good silhouette.
- Uh-huh.
Well, just, you know, make sure
it flatters your figure
and that, you know, you can
serve true Roxxxy Andrews.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Ru's looking at me funny,
and I'm not sure that he likes
what I'm doing.
- Yeah, yeah. Wow.
- Now what am I gonna do?
- You better bring some hard
Roxxxy candy on the runway.
Get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
All right, gather around,
my little gumdrops.
Now, tomorrow at the Sugar Ball,
we'll be joined my our
extra special guest judges,<i> </i>
<i>CSI</i><span style="bodyStyle"> star Marg Helgenberger...</i>
- I love her!
- Whoo!
- And fashion's most delicious
designer.
Bob Mackie will be here.
[all gasp]
- What?
- Shut up!
- Ahh!
- Bob Mackie has done
Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Cher,
everybody.
He's a master at what he does.
- No pressure.
- Right.
- And there's just one more
thing.
In addition to creating your
three sickeningly sweet looks,
you need perform a<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
opening number.
Now, Alaska, as the winner
of the mini challenge,
you're in charge
of the choreography.
- Oh!
[laughs]
- Oh, god.
- Get your bowleg on.
all: Get your bowleg on.
Get your bowleg on.
- Alaska's got
about this much rhythm.
So this is gonna be
a hot fucking shitty mess.
- I expect to see sugar and
spice and everything nice,
so don't fuck it up.
See you later.
[indistinct chatter]
- After Ru's walk-through,
I look over, and Roxxxy's look
is completely gone.
- Ru said something
about my silhouette, so--
at this point in the game,
if she's saying something,
it's for a reason.
- Right.
- I'm starting
back at square one.
I'm going with this licorice.
It looks like spaghetti.
This licorice is so thin.
But I'm putting on there
one at a time.
It's so tedious.
So this much time,
this much work.
- [whistling]
[pounding]
- Jinkx, really?
I'm stressed right now.
I have a lot to get done.
Like, girl, could you please
stop banging?
- Jinkx and the hammer is
driving me berserk.
And I've fucking had it.
[pounding]
- Huh!
[pounding]
- Merry Christmas.
- Coming up...
- ♪<i> Our lips are glazed ♪</i>
♪<i> Our eyes are candy-crazed ♪</i>
- You're wrong, Jinkx.
Girl, it's left to right.
- 'Cause I don't want
to hit you
when you walk past me.
- If you hit me, I'm gonna
hit you right in the face.
- Aw, fuck.
It isn't going on.
What the fuck was that?
Aah!
I broke my entire outfit.
- [laughing]
[techno music]
- Today we have to come up with
a lip-sync performance
to a song called<i> Sugar Babies.</i>
All right.
- This musical number
is right up my alley.
This is me in my element.
- I'm no Alyssa Edwards when
it comes to choreography.
- You're not a choreographer
to the stars?
- I'm not.
We'll enter in that order--
you, her, her, me.
- You want us to enter and
go where?
And how do you want us to enter?
We all know Alaska is not
the best dancer,
so we don't know
what's gonna happen.

♪<i> The sugar babies ♪</i>
- We gotta do something else
here.
- [coughs]
- 'Cause this is totally cute
for the first part.
- Yeah.
- But then what are we gonna do?
Should we do, like, a little
up, down thing too?
Like, Alaska and I--
[laughs] yeah.
- It's confusing to me, though.
- ♪<i> We are, we are ♪</i>
♪<i> So simple ♪</i>
Alaska's lucky, 'cause if it was
some kind of pop, pop, booty,
kind of pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
it'd be a hot mess.
- That's too complicated.
[laughs]
- It would be funny
if we did something
where we're licking the suckers
and then we're having, like,
a sugar high.
- Why don't we do
the circle thing?
They always do a circle thing.
- Jinkx is acting
a little too wild,
and I know Roxxxy and I are
getting annoyed.
We don't have time for any
of that bullshit.
Which way are you gonna start,
Rox?
- I'll start right to left.
- Okay.
- Left, right.
- Should we all be going
the same way?
- No, opposites.
- I can't see anybody,
so follow me.
- Well, you would have to--
yeah, we'll all follow you.

- Whoa.
- You're wrong Jinkx,

Girl, it's left to right.
It's not science.
- ♪<i> Our lips are glazed ♪</i>
- We're so off.
- We're all relying
on each other
to figure out where we're
moving our candy canes.
And Jinkx is going super fast.
It seems like she's trying to be
a scene stealer,
and that's throwing the rest
of the group off.
- The reason I keep
getting off, Roxxxy--
you pass by me so close
that I don't want to hit you
when I'm doing this.
- 'cause it seems like
you switch.
- Oh, I thought she was fine.
- But you were still off.
- 'Cause I don't want
to hit you
when you walk past me.
- If you hit me, I'm gonna
hit you right in the face.
Just sayin'.
- Roxxxy's grasping at straws
to try to shake me.
I think it's because I've never
had to lip-sync for my life.
And so any chance she gets,
she's coming for me.
- ♪<i> We're sweet as pie ♪</i>
♪<i> The kind you wanna try ♪</i>
♪<i> With jelly-friendly</i>
<i>sugarcoated cones ♪</i>
- So, um, are you not
lip-syncing on purpose?
- I don't know it yet.
I don't even know
what I'm saying.
- I'm just checking.
We're all sort of at least
faking our way through
the lip sync, but, like,
Roxxxy's just, like, not moving
her mouth at all.
It's like, "Oh, okay."
- Do you want me and Detox
to end
with both of our hands up?
Or the right on the right hand,
left on the left hand,
and you in the middle?
- Yeah, that.
- Am I in the middle or
the side?
Where do you want me?
If it totally tanks,
I don't think
that it's anybody else's
responsibility
except for Alaska's.
- Whew!
- We're back in from rehearsal.
We all have a lot to do.
We have three looks to plan
for tomorrow.
And the tensions are high,
so let's get to fucking work.
- So, girls,
it's awfully quiet.
- Yeah, girl, we got work
to do.
- [yawns]
[snores lightly]
There is still so much to do.
And the narcolepsy kicks in,
and it's a struggle just to keep
my eyelids open.
I can't even see what I'm
looking at anymore.
[can rattling]
Oh, fuck.
I'm starting to get so tired.
Like, I'm half asleep,
trying to make a dress.
When I shake myself out of it,
I look at my dress,
and I'm like,
"What the fuck happened?"
This isn't what I wanted it
to look like.
I'm panicking, yeah.
- I've never seen Jinkx
so freaked out,
on the verge of tears.
A little part of me is so happy,
because the judges are finally
gonna see
that she's a whole hot
shitty trailer Christmas mess.
About time.
- Ugh!
- [fake crying]
- It's elimination day,
and we have a lot of work to do
for this Sugar Ball.
At the end of today, there will
only be three of us.
It's scary.
- Is it hideous,
or is it not hideous?
- I mean, it's a lot of stuff
going on.
- I mean, a big part of me
just wants to ditch
the big hoop skirt thing,
but then I only have candy
on my corset.
- Right.
- I'm going back and forth.
It's like cut this and lose
most of the candy
and most of the work I did
or keep this
and risking looking like
a complete joke on the runway.
I feel like an idiot.
- How much work does everyone
have left to do?
- I still have to, like, finish
this jewelry up
and then put a strap
on this dress.
And then I'm gonna start working
on hair.
Did you change anything?
- I just added some more candy,
And I need to finish adding
candy.
I'm liking it a lot much better
now I added these little
carnation things to it.
I'm gonna do a couple more.
- I love it.
- Detox's Candy Couture outfit
doesn't look candy-inspired
in the slightest.
Herein lies the problem
of having a best friend
in this competition.
Roxxxy's so close to Detox,
she can't bring herself to say,
"Detox, that dress doesn't read
as candy."
- Aw, fuck. Goddamn.
What is wrong with this?
I don't know why
it isn't going on.
It's fucking pissing me off.
We're completely running out
of time.
This was supposed to just go on
and look good,
and that's not happening.
[object clatters]
What the fuck was that?
Aah!
- What just happened?
- The candy is falling off.
Chunks of the cotton candy
clouds are just shattering.
- Fuck cok-sucking hell shit.
I broke my entire outfit, so--
- What?
- I don't know how this thing's
going to get down the runway.
I'm completely panicking
right now.
Ow.
- Alaska and Jinkx,
they're both the weakest
in the competition.
- Jesus Christ.
- It's time for them to
lip-sync for their life.
- Coming up...
- It makes me question
your taste level.
- She was a really
promiscuous-looking 16-year-old.
- You know, they want to look
like a whore.

Category is Super Super
Sweet 16.
Oh, my god.
First up, Alaska.
Hi!
- Dad got me this nose for
my birthday.
- Yes.
[laughter]
- It's her 16th birthday, and
her dad paid for everything,
but her stupid friends
won't text her back.
- Young lady, you better not be
sexting.
- Mom, you've ruined
everything!
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, hippy girl.
<i>Almost Famous.</i>
- This is Pacific Northwest
stoner chick extravaganza look.
- Jinkx, I read your diary,
and we need to have a talk.
- My name's not Jinkx anymore.
It's Dreamcatcher.

- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Usher is performing
at my sweet 16.
- Oh!
- She got a marshmallow ring?
- Yeah!
- Where my peeps at?
- I'm loving every minute.
The judges are smiling.
I'm giving them 16-year-old
realness.
- She's 16 going on sickening.
[laughter]
Up next, Detox.
- She's a Pink Lady.
- Pink Ladies rule the school.
- Yeah.
- My sweet 16 look is
'80s-inspired.
I'm working this lollipop,
sexy sweet 16.
- Rizzo's P.G.
- Pass it on.
- [laughs]
- Category is Sugar Mama,
executive realness.
Alaska.
- Cougar lady.
- Yes.
She's serving Barbara Corcoran.
[laughter]
- This woman takes her job
very seriously.
She's coming to visit
the construction site,
and, by god, there better not be
any bullshit.
- Tear down that bitch of

- Tina Knowles, I'm not buying

Category is Candy Couture,
edible eleganza.
First up, Alaska.
I think the material is
a cotton candy blend.
- I was having
some serious issues
with this cotton candy
fantasy.
So I'm feeling beautiful and
right,
but please, candy couture,
don't fall apart.
- Fluff the magic drag queen.
- Mmm.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
It's a hard candy Christmas.
- And her breath
is minty fresh.
I decided not to wear
that damn hoop skirt,
and I couldn't be more pleased
with the way it turned out.
I am the Abominable Snow Jinkx.
- Peppermint patty realness.
- This is a stag party.
[laughter]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Ooh.
- Wow, taste the rainbow.
- Bitches.
- Those judges cannot take this
coutureness.
Miss Thing, I know
my body looks right.
This licorice is exactly where
I need to be laying.
- Melts in your mouth.
- I wonder if her panties are
edible too.
- They are.
- Detox.
Very Splenda in the grass.
- My candy couture look,
it's Detox.
It's electric.
It still has a little touch
of the '80s.
- Lollipopulence.
- Yes.
- Is that some black licorice
I see?
- Uh-huh.
Licorice and lace.
Coming up...
Which one of you sweethearts
does not deserve to be
in the top three?
[dramatic music]
- [laughing]
Welcome, ladies.
Thanks to your candy couture,
I've got a cavity.
And it's throbbing.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Alaska, so<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was</i>
really cute.
I thought that it was
a little simple.
But your sweet 16, perfection.
- I see these girls all over
my part of Los Angeles. [laughs]
And I love how you committed
to the character.
- The cougar lady,
perfect in every way.
And the cotton candy is, to me,
the best representation of
candy.
I knew exactly what you were
when you walked out.
That's important.
- All right, next up
Jinkx Monsoon.
- The<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> number,</i>
you really stood out,
'cause I did like your
googly-eye bit.
- Your sweet 16 party girl,
16 going on 47.
Like, she didn't feel young
at all.
- When I walked
into the werk room,
you had a big hoop skirt
that you had doctored and--
- Oh, yes.
I think it was a good choice
not to try to do too much
in one look.
- Jinkx, you break my heart.
I really want to see candy
glued to every piece of fabric
that you have on.
A hoop skirt
would have allowed you
to glue more candy onto
your outfit.
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Your sweet 16 party girl,
I love that you did the edible
marshmallow jewelry,
although she was a really
promiscuous-looking 16-year-old.
- The executive look, I love.
You just looked like a bitch
on wheels.
I loved it.
- You reminded me of
<i>The Devil Wears Prada.</i>
And I love the candy couture
outfit.
You should make it for yourself
out of real fabric,
because you look great in it.
It's so flattering.
- Up next, Detox.
- I liked your sweet 16
'80s look--
your attitude, the jacket.
And the sugar mama executive
reminded me of, like,
Glenn Close in<i> Fatal Attraction.</i>
- Your candy couture, though...
girl, it's a stretch.
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect
between buying something
off the rack
versus designing something for
yourself.
And it makes me question
your taste level.
- All right.
Thank you, Detox.
Ladies, I hate to end
on a sour patch,
but I have one
final question.
Which one of you sweethearts
does not deserve to be
in the top three and why?
Starting with Jinkx.
- The one who has fallen short
most often up here is Detox.
- Alaska, same question.
- I would say Jinkx Monsoon.
I absolutely love her, but
I feel like there's maturing
that I would like to see.
- Roxxxy Andrews?
- Jinkx Monsoon.
The challenges that she needed
to step outside of her box
and design and be creative,
she didn't do well.
I had to be funny where I had
to be funny.
And it when it landed me
in the bottom,
it landed me in the bottom.
- Detox?
- I do agree
with the other girls.
It's not really a school
for girls.
It's a competition for the best
of the best.
- All right.
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
Now, while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
All right.
Just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Let's start with Alaska.
- Alaska really brought three
fully realized looks.
I liked her sweet 16 number.
- The only thing is, I would've
maybe have liked to have seen,
like, a light color dress.
Like, why black?
- It's the days of wearing
a lot of fluffy pink
doesn't exist anymore.
You know, they want to look like
a whore.
[laughter]
- What's wrong with that, Bob?
[laughter]
- The executive sugar mama,
she committed to who she was
bossing around.
I loved it.
- It could go really bad
for a man in drag
wearing a blazer
and a pair of slacks.
But the way she cut it in
at the waist,
the way she padded herself,
I bought it.
- I thought the candy costume
was the only one that really
said candy when she walked out.
And I think she knows how to use
those legs.
- She's bowlegged.
[laughter]
- Yeah, she is,
but, boy, from the crotch down,
she's a star.
[laughter]
- Detox.
- Her sweet 16 just left me,
like, "Ugh. Really?
I feel like you can do better
than that."
I'm not getting what I want
from her.
- The executive look,
what I liked most
about it was the crazy-ass hair
juxtaposed with that, like,
very sleek suit.
- She was very prepared with
the fashion that she brought.
But then when she is asked to do
something from scratch, like,
the taste level, like,
disappears.
- If they're gonna design
their own dress,
they have to know
how to work that dress.
She didn't work it at all.
She never did anything
except just stumble over it
and trip all over it.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy was the only one
who brought candy
to each and every one
of her looks.
- The sugar mama executive,
I loved her attitude.
There was something--I kind of
liked that it was a short dress,
and she's kind of got, you know,
muscular thighs.
- Her candy couture was my
favorite of the night.
- But we didn't know
that was candy.
- But she worked it.
- When I was backstage
with her,
she had something completely
different,
something that looked like
a candy-coated Dorito.
- [laughs]
That sounds good.
- Yeah, it sounds delicious.
But I questioned it, and she
changed it, you know?
And that's the sign of someone
who is paying attention.
All right,
moving on to Jinkx Monsoon.
- I think she's a terrific
performer.
But as far as the candy couture
outfit goes,
it just didn't really work.
- If you can't tell that your
'70s-inspired look
isn't really doing
the sweet 16 thing,
I don't know when you're gonna
know that.
- She looked like Bette Davis
in<i> Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte.</i>
- [laughs]
- I mean, truly.
That long wig
and that weird lacy, ugly dress.
- Jinkx kind of failed
at every single one
of the things tonight,
although I did feel, really,
that she was getting thrown
under the bus by Rolodex here.
- Rolaskatox.
- Yeah. They're Rolodex.
I think they were like, "Oh,
let's get to the top three
together."
It was like season one
of<i> Survivor.</i>
- [laughs]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Alaska, your candy couture gave
the judges a real sugar rush.
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Ahh!
[applause]
- You've won a private portrait
session
with celebrity photographer
Austin Young.
- I'm in the top three.
I am so happy.
- Roxxxy Andrews, I'm gonna
keep this short...
and sweet.
You're safe.
Condragulations.
You've made it
to the final three.
You may step to the back of
the stage.
Detox, Jinkx Monsoon,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.
- It's more than I can even
process right now.
My body, it's all numb.
- I'm pissed off that I'm here.
It's devastating.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.
- The lights go down, and
the last things I say to myself
are "I love you, Nana" and
"water off a duck's back."
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

Jinkx Monsoon,
shantay, you stay.
Detox, you had me hooked
from day one,
and I can't get you
out of my system.
And now
neither can anyone else.
Now sashay away.
- It's been so magical and
so humbling.
Thank you so much, from
the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you, Detox.
- I'm gonna miss
all of you guys.
I love you.
I love you so much.
- [yells]
It really fucking sucks
that I didn't all the way
to the top three,
like I had intended to.
A better fit
would've definitely been
to have me in the top three.
But I just can't thank Ru
enough.
The only thing I have left to
say is...I've had it.
Bye.
- The top three.
One final challenge stands
between you and $100,000.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- [laughs] All right.
Now let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>

-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.
I've got to shake this off
and move on.
- You'll be debuting
an original drag ballet.
- I can't dance.
- Coco, you pick first.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- What the fuck?
- Here's what I want from you,
Jinkx.
I want to see some glamour.
- The winner is Alyssa Edwards.
- [exhales with relief]
- Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,
I'm sending you both home.
Now, ladies, sashay away.
- Girl.
- After the double elimination,
every girl knows Ru is not
playing the radio.
- Girl.
- Crack.
That's a sign of don't get
too comfortable.
- That was the closest I ever
want to get to the bottom.
To be in the bottom three has
lit a fire under my ass.
Never again.
- I think everyone is just
shocked that Roxxxy Andrews
is in the bottom three.
But I'm not shocked.
She's part of Rolaskatox, and
they've convinced themselves
that they're invincible.
- But you won.
- I wish she would have sent
all y'all bitches home.
[laughter]
- I want you to go home too,
bitch, so you don't throw me
in the bottom again.
Alyssa wanted to act
like she's so real,
but I think it was a pretty
bitchy-ass move to call
me out onstage.
- The one that I would want to
send home is not in this lineup.
I don't see Jade
at the same level.
If she would've asked me who
needed to go,
I would have said that,
because from the view
that I was getting,
it looked like a sausage
squeezed into a two-piece.
It was not pretty.
- You can't take it personal.
- You're a dirty bitch.
- It's not dirty.
I kept it real to your face.
If I wanted to be dirty, I would
have really, really read you.
Ha.
- Well, girl, if you read me,
I would have read you
right back.
- That's a part of the game,
baby.
Welcome to drag.
I knew coming into this
competition that the claws
would come out.
I don't want to scratch
anybody's eyes out.
I just want to scratch my way
to the top.

Sickening.

to find out who wore it best.
And we're going to do it
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> style.</i>
Now, you'll have just 30 minutes
to turn these cuddlers...
- Ooh.
- Into something
red carpet worthy.
I'll decide who wore it best.
Ready, set, style.
[all shouting, laughing]
- Damn.
- How am I supposed to wear
something so goddamn ugly?
- It'll be like everything else
you wear.
- How dare you?
- Oh, really?
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
[camera shutter clicking]
To help me make this sartorial
decision,
I've invited an expert.
From<i> Us Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine,</i>
please welcome senior editor
Ian Drew.
[all cheering]
- Uh, Ru?
Is that a Klein Epstein &amp; Parker
suit that you're wearing?
- Why, yes, it is.
What do you think?
- Well, I think, in this case,
Ru wore it best.
- Aw.
[laughter]
All right.
First up, wearing zebra,
Coco Montrese.
You want some Coco
in your Cocoa?
Next up, Ivy Winters.
Girls gone wild kingdom.
Detox.
She's pairing it with some
DayGlo.
[imitates camera shutter

[laughter]
All right, Ian.
- Yes.
- Who wore it best?
- I'd have to say Detox.
- Ah, Detox.
- Yay.
- Next up, wearing giraffe,
Lineysha Sparx.
[imitates camera shutter

Ooh, look at that manicure.
Roxxxy Andrews.
<i>Jet</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine, this way.</i>
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
Next up, Alaska.
Dear Lord.
African<i> Vogue,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this way.</i>
- I think it was the best makeup
she's worn all season.
- So, Ian, who wore it best?
The name on everybody's lips has
got to be Roxxxy.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
First up wearing pink,
Alyssa Edwards.
Who are the jewels by?
- They're rented.
[laughter]
- A night at the opera.
Jade Jolie, a vision in pink.
- [laughs]
- Thank you, Jade Jolie.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, my.
- The missing Olsen twin.
- Uh-huh.
- She just woke up.
- This way, Jinkx.
- I don't think Jinkx did
anything with the blanket.
She just put the blanket on
and gave it a character...
what she does best.
- All right, Ian.
So who wore it best?
- It is a stiff competition,
I will say.
- Oh.
- But it has to be
Alyssa Edwards.
- All right, Alyssa Edwards.
Well, condragulations
to our best dressed queens.
You've each won an<i> Us Weekly</i>
swag bag.
Now, Ian...
- Yes.
- I'm about to give you
a<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> exclusive.</i>
For this week's main challenge,
we're going to play...
wait for it, wait for it...
Snatch Game.
[all cheering]
- This is what I came here
to do.
- Time to break out your best
celebrity impersonations.
Be fabulous, be a star, and,
most importantly, be funny.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- So what's everybody doing?
What you doing?
- You doing Katy?
- I'm doing Ke$ha.
- [laughs]
- Who are you doing, Alaska?
- Lady Bunny.
- Oh.
It's risky.
- And she just did Lady Bunny
in the last challenge.
- That's very risky.
- Who are you doing, Roxxxy?
- Tamar Braxton, honey.
- [laughs]
- Who?
- Tamar Braxton,
Toni Braxton's sister.
If you don't know her,
you're going to know her.
- Oh, is she coming to life
today?
- She coming to life tonight.
Tonight!
- This is something you should
be strong at, right?
- I'm hoping.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to do Little Edie
from<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
- Who--what?
- Little Edie from<i> </i>
<i>Grey Gardens.</i>
-<i> Grey Gardens?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Who is that?
- Who is it?
- So Jackie O. has this cousin
and this aunt
who went bankrupt
and became shut-ins,
living in a big,
dilapidated mansion.
Little Edie had alopecia and
lost all her hair out of the
stress,
and then she became a big
fashion icon
years after she died.
- Do you think a lot of people
are going to recognize
that character?
- Little Edie is a risky
character.
Not everyone's going to know
who she is.
But I think people should know
who she is.
Here's your pate, mother,
darling.
At least, I think it's pate.
The label's faded.
[both speaking Spanish]
- When you're dealing with
people judging what you do,
you just have to let it roll off
like water off a duck's back.
All right.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Who are you doing?
- Michelle Obama.
- Michelle Obama?
Okay.
- This about to get real ugly.
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look.
- I'm not joking, bitch.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Our main challenge today is
to pick a celebrity character
and play them on
The Snatch Game.
- Freaking out.
- Are you scared you can't make
Ke$ha funny?
- I think I can make her funny.
- Snatch Game challenges your
improv skills, your wit,
and your impersonation skills.
Without these three things, a
drag queen might as well not
call herself a drag queen.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hey, mama.
- Ah, who are you doing?
- Miss Monroe.
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.
- How are you going to make
Marilyn Monroe funny?
- That's a good question.
[laughs]
Um, I think it's just relating
a lot to her movies.
Um...
- Yeah.
What about the funny part?
- I just have to be big
and blonde.
- Well, the tricky thing with
Marilyn, too,
is that she was
the smart dumb blonde.
So that sort of nuance
is not easy to do.
Get it going and make me laugh.
- I will.
- All right.
Alaska.
- Hi.
- 49th state.
- The biggest state.
- Oh, that's right.
It's like its own country.
- I'm my own continent.
- Oh.
- I'm incontinent, though.
- [laughs]
So who are you doing?
- I'm doing Lady Bunny.
- Ex-squeeze me?
Bunny is hilar--
I think she's actually the
funniest person I've ever met.
It's a tricky one.
I want you to be funnier
than Bunny.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- All right.
I'm scared shitless.
How the fuck am I supposed
to measure up to that?
- Hey, Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, okay, I'm getting
psychic feelings.
Um...
let me guess.
Margaret Thatcher?
- No, Ru.
Janet Jackson.
- I love me some Janet.
Now, what made you decide
to do Janet?
- I do Janet six nights a week
in Vegas.
- Really?
Six nights a week?
- Yes.
I really actually studied
everything about her onstage
and offstage.
So, if I don't know this
character,
then I shouldn't be doing drag.
- You got to bring the funny.
- Okay.
- All right.
Hi, Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- I don't know who that could
be.
Let's see--Rachel Zoe
after a fire?
- No, I'm going to do my friend
Ke$ha.
- You're friends with Ke$ha?
- I've worked with her a few
times,
and I've done a bunch of her
music videos.
And, yeah, she's a lot of fun.
- Since you actually know Ke$ha,
how are you going to not sort of
hold back?
- I don't want to, like,
slander her too much.
- Well, that could be a problem.
You got to be willing
to make a fool
out of the person you're doing.
When the camera lands on you,
you have 30 seconds, from the
waist up, to make it happen.
Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Hi, Jinkxy.
- Hi.
You caught me
with one eyebrow on.
- You are a quirky character.
I am just dying to find out...
who are you playing?
- Her name is
Little Edie Bouvier Beale.
- Jackie Kennedy's cousin.
- Yes.
- I love her.
But are you a little worried
that the audience at home
won't know who she is?
- It's a concern I had, but I
kept tossing around, you know,
pop icons I could do, and just--
none of them speak
to me the same way.
I landed on Little Edie because
I really relate to her,
and since I started in this
competition,
I feel even more connected
with her right now.
She's a little misunderstood.
- Yes, well, just make sure you
make Little Edie pop
for the unwashed masses.
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.
I'm going to let you get to it.
All right.
Lineysha Sparx.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- Who are you doing?
- I'm going to do
Michelle Obama.
- Michelle Obama?
- Yes.
- That's an interesting choice.
What made you decide to do
Michelle Obama?
- Because I think that I can
look like her, and--
- It's more than just looking
like the person.
They have to be funny.
Can I hear a little bit
of your Michelle Obama?
What did you serve Obama
for breakfast this morning?
- French fries.
- Um...
french fries.
Yeah.
Michelle Obama,
how are your daughters?
- [laughs]
Aw.
- Who are your other choices?
- I really--
I was thinking Celia Cruz.
- Is a good choice.
- But...
right now I got this choice.
I think it's better.
Celia Cruz--she's the queen of
the salsa,
but I really know that I can
look like Michelle Obama,
so I'm not going to change.
- It's a tough sell--
Michelle Obama.
Just be funny.
Be funny.
- I'm Michelle Obama,
and I approve this message.
- Ladies, gather round.
Now, I'll see you on the set,
with our extra special
guest judges...
MTV royalty Julie Brown
and Downtown Julie Brown.
[all cheering]
Don't fuck it up.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Julie Brown!
- Girl, which one do you think
I should do--Katy or her?
Miss Kim--this is not Kim.
This is too platinum.
I'm not 100% sold on Katy Perry.
I'm really thinking I should
probably switch to Kim from
<i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>
Celebrity impersonation is not
part of my gig,
and that makes me second-guess
myself
and what is the right character
for me.
- I have my makeup
like Michelle Obama.
I have my wig.
But I have in my mind the voice
of RuPaul.
- Do you know enough about
Michelle Obama to make it funny?
- Do you know enough about
Celia Cruz?
- Mm-mm.
My other option is Celia Cruz,
but I don't have the clothes.
I don't have the right wigs.
So...
I don't know.
- I'm worried about Lineysha
because I don't think she knows
what she's doing at this point.
She needs to get it together.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.
- Get your life.
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.
[laughter]
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.
Today it's a battle
of the Browns.
She put the "wubba" in
"wubba, wubba, wubba."
Downtown Julie Brown!
And she's, like, totally
the original valley girl--
Julie Brown.
May I call you
"Uptown Julie Brown"?
- I prefer "just say Julie."
- [laughs]
Now let's meet
our celebrity panel.
Direct from Grey Gardens,
it's Little Edie Beale.
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.
- How is Big Edie doing?
- She's always begging for the
pate, but the label is faded.
I can never tell if it's pate or
if it's giblets for the cats.
[laughter]
- Next, don't break up with her
because she'll write a song
about it.
It's Taylor Swift.
- I can't believe I'm here.
This is so exciting.
[giggles]
- Next, my old, old, old, old,
old friend, Lady Bunny.
- You know, the last time I had
a battle of the Browns was about
ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.
- [laughs]
- Hey, Ke$ha.
- I just woke up here.
- You're at The Snatch Game,
honey.
- What's that?
- Now it's the president of the
rhythm nation, Janet Jackson.
- Hi, Ru. How are you?
- What have you done for me
lately?
- I haven't put out a hit
in a while.
- Next, she's my teenage dream.
Hey, Katy Perry.
Oh, is that your fragrance?
- It is.
Would you like to try some?
- No.
- Okay.
- Good-bye, Norma Jean.
Hello, Marilyn Monroe.
- Hello, Ru.
- Now, is it true that gentlemen
prefer blondes?
- Oh, they do.
You know it.
- Fabulous.
Next up, it's the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.
<i>Hola!</i>
- I'm very fine here.
My English is
no very good-looking.
- Last but not least, it's
Braxton family bad girl...
Tamar Braxton.
- Get your life!
- What's Toni really like?
- Girl, who cares?
This is my first gig without
Toni, and I am so excited.
Boom!
[laughter]
- Okay, here's how the game
works.
I ask the question.
Our celebrity panel fills
in the blanks.
And you give an answer that you
think will match.
First question for Julie Brown.
Lady Bunny is so over politics.
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just blanks.
- Pleasures herself
with the voting wand.
- Let's hear what our
celebrities have to say.
- Little Edie?
- Well, I don't know her
personally,
but she looks older than mother
darling, so I said,
when she steps into the voting
booth, she just seizures.
Spelling?
- Seize--[laughs]
[laughter]
Not a match.
Moving on to Celia Cruz,
the queen of salsa.
Lady Bunny is so over politics.
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just...
- Flip her hair back and forth.
- I think it's "whip your hair
back and forth."
- Uh-huh.
-<i> Si.</i>
- Uh-huh,<i> si.</i>
- No el match-o.
- No match-o?
- No.
All right, we're going to the
original material girl,
Marilyn Monroe.
- She passes out.
I think if it was me, it'd be
the hard decision-making.
I get a little bit light-headed
sometimes.
- Now, you're into politics,
aren't you?
Presidents and...
- Ivy totally didn't get the
joke.
It was an awkward moment.
- Quite the scandal, actually.
[laughter]
With my cousin-in-law, really?
- [laughs] Yes.
- It was in all the magazines
at the time.
[laughter]
- All right, next question is
for Downtown Julie Brown.
- Yes.
- Heather the hoarder is such
a mess.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- When she opens her box.
- Let's see if we get a match
from Taylor Swift.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Falls out of her Taylor Swift
lunchbox.
- Oh, that's a match!
She's got box!
All right, let's move on
to Katy Perry.
- Hi, Ru.
- Did you really kiss a girl?
Have you ever kissed a girl?
- [gasps] Ru, never.
- But--uh, yeah.
Have you ever fucked
a black guy?
[laughter]
Okay, okay.
Heather the hoarder
is such a mess.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Her clutch.
- Sorry.
Not a match.
- I think that immunity for
Alyssa is gonna come in real
handy this week.
- Lady Bunny, same question.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Well, Julie,
I just wrote "anus."
[laughter]
- Same neighborhood--
not a match.
[all awwing]
Next question is
for Julie Brown.
Lady Gaga has finally gone
too far.
She wore a dress made of blank.
- Madonna's leftovers.
- Madonna's leftovers!
Let's go to the stars.
Ke$ha, she wore a dress made
of blank.
- I said "her stupid monsters,"
'cause my animals
are fucking badass.
- Oh, right, that's what you
pop stars call your fans.
- Yeah.
- Let's move on to the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.
- Hey, hey.
- She wore a dress made
of blank.
"A can of tomato salsa."
- Like a big can.
- [imitates buzzing]
Flat.
- All right.
- [scatting]
- Tamar, Lady Gaga's finally
gone too far.
Last week she wore a dress made
of blank.
- Boom!
Who cares?
I'm so sick and tired of hearing
about that bitch.
[laughter]
Tamar's world.
- That's right.
Moving on--this one's for
Downtown Julie Brown.
Paula Deen is out of control.
This morning she put a stick
of butter on her blank.
- On her toothbrush.
- On her toothbrush!
- [laughs]
- Miss Janet Jackson.
- I think she put it
in her panty liner.
- Panty liner.
- I did too.
You want to see what happened?
- Yes.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my God, it's so thin.
- That's impressive.
- Coco's voice as Janet
was so perfect.
But she wasn't able
to make it funny.
- Ru, may I ask you why you
couldn't have gotten me real
celebrities for this game?
- Well...
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.
You could have gotten
Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn
or any one of them.
Instead you got ketchup.
- Ketchup?
- And that must be
Janice Jickson?
- Can I ask you a question, Ru?
- Yes, you can ask me
a question.
- What's a Little Edie?
- Little Edie is a star of
a movie,<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
- Okay, well,
she's not that little.
Who the hell is Little Edie?
I didn't know what that is.
- Okay, moving on--
[singsong] Tamar Braxton.
- Get your life!
- Now, Paula Deen
is out of control.
This morning she put a stick
of butter...
- On her--boom--Louboutins,
'cause her fat-ass feet
don't fit in 'em.
[laughter]
- I really have to pee.
[record scratches]
Can I pee?
- Just a--in just one second.
We're get--we're almost done.
- I'm gonna go ahead and pee
over here by Tamar.
- She's gonna go pee in the
corner.
- [laughing]
[liquid rushing]
Ke$ha!
- Do you have toilet paper?
- Yeah, I'll get somebody
to clean that up.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Detox bathroom break?
[mouthing] Gross.
- All right, I'm afraid we've
run out of time.
And the winner is...
who cares?
[laughter and applause]
Thanks for joining us, everyone.
Until next time, RuPaul out.
Say good night, stars!
both: Good night, stars.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- I don't understand why you're
really trying to, like,
come for me.
- Girl, you came for me.
- It just came off as
"annoying skank."
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Ro...
- Laska...
- Tox.
- It's elimination day, and
with a challenge
like The Snatch Game,
it's definitely a lot more
intense.
- Alyssa, are you glad you had
immunity?
[all oohing]
- I don't do characters.
I mean, this was going to be the
hardest challenge for me,
period.
- At this point, we know Snatch
Game is gonna happen.
- Right.
- You should already have a plan
from the moment you audition.
- America's Next Drag Superstar
is not going to travel the
country being a comedian.
She needs to be sickening.
Do the math.
Jinkx, on the runway, I think
you should've prepared more
than one look.
- Honey, all your outfits
haven't been that clean either.
What you wore--that gold the
other day--
some people shouldn't come down
to wear a two-piece,
because the view that I had in
the safe zone was not too cute.
- I don't understand why you're
trying to, like, come for me.
I mean--
- Girl, you came for me, right
out there,
threw me under the fuckin' bus.
- You're still mad about that,
girl?
I mean, are you intrigued
or something?
- No, honey--
- Obsess much?
- That's one thing I ain't.
One thing I'm not is intrigued.
- Jade, I can speak up
for myself.
Alyssa, every week I've done
a different look.
Like, one time I was space age.
The next time I was
Marie Antoinette.
- No, no, no, no, some people
are coming down the runway
in complete bullshit.
Had I pulled that on the runway,
they would have ripped me
to shreds, and y'all know it.
Jinkx--she's all comedy
and no glamour.
I don't think from day one,
she's put anything on the runway
worth looking at.
- I have dealt with this my
entire drag career, you know?
It's getting frustrating to have
to defend a style of drag
that's completely valid.
When I first got to Seattle,
because I'm kind of quirky,
not a lot of queens took me
very seriously.
- Girl, what if I just went out
there
and not even brushed its hair?
I'ma say, "Well, I was trying
to make it funny.
Everything got to be funny,
right?"
- [voice breaking] Every time
I step into something new,
I have to fight this fight
again.
I don't want to have to keep
explaining myself.
- Miss Coco, you're gonna have
to do a little bit more pink
in the eye.
- You concerned about what's
going on over here when
you need to be worried about
what's going over there with
that same makeup you've been
running on the runway
every single time.
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look, girl.
- Don't start with me.
- You're used to being my
runner-up and being behind me.
Don't switch the game up now,
mama.
- Okay, now, miss Alyssa...
[others whooping]
- Now you pushed it.
- Miss Coco, you're taking it
personal.
I'm joking with you.
- Oh, now I'm not joking, bitch!
You gonna call me a runner-up?
- You ain't never won nothing.
By default, mama--
you take that picture
by default.
- No, I took that picture
'cause you couldn't do the job,
bitch.
- I got that moment, though.
- She got the crown
put on her head.
She got to feel the emotion
of that moment.
She took that away from me.
I'll be damned if I let her take
that away from me here...
not without a fight.
This about to get real ugly.
- You know what's ugly?
Poverty.
[laughter]
- The Jade!
- The Jade of it all.
-<i> And what?</i>
[light applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
are you ready to play?
- Always.
- Santino's in the house.
- You are looking snatchtacular
tonight, Ru.
- [laughs]
- Downtown Julie Brown,
do you feel lucky?
- Very lucky.
- And the hilarious Julie Brown.
Did you have fun yesterday?
- I had such a great time.
- Tonight the queens are
serving their own girlish
glamour on the runway.
Category is...
deadliest snatch.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[electronic beeping]
<i>Commence shake down.</i>
First up, Ivy Winters.
Goldfish.
- It's little she-mo!
-<i> I'm strutting down the runway,</i>
<i>and I could feel my little fin</i>
<i>flopping.</i>
<i>I felt very fishy.</i>
- Now, that's a catch.
- But still very "koi."
[laughter]
Detox.
Ooh, she's a power pouf girl.
- Or a cupcake.
-<i> I'm serving killer jellyfish</i>
<i>realness,</i>
<i>and I'm living for it.</i>
- You know,
you could shoplift in that.
She could steal a ham.
- Jade Jolie.
Chain, chain, chain!
-<i> I'm serving up some bondage</i>
<i>bombshell fish fierceness,</i>
<i>and I am loving it.</i>
- She spent a lot at Home Depot
for that one.
- Yes.
- [laughs]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
It's like a blazer
and no trousers.
- Blazer!
-<i> Miss Thang, I am walking down</i>
<i>this runway like I am</i>
<i>$10 million.</i>
<i>Pose, pose, pose.</i>
- Roxxxy, your pussy is on fire.
- [laughs]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
chicken of the sea.
-<i> I am serving up Seattle boho</i>
<i>chic</i>
<i>with a flair of day out</i>
<i>at the beach.</i>
[giggles]
- She's like a flying fish.
- Brackish, actually.
- Now there are 102 ways
to wear a scarf.
[laughter]
Ooh, Coco, girl.
- All right, little Coco Minaj.
-<i> I am turning it out.</i>
<i>This is my runway.</i>
<i>Thank you, Ru, for letting me</i>
<i>borrow it.</i>
- Those boots are made
for stomping.
- Or wading through a river.
[laughter]
- Alyssa Edwards.
The little mermaid's
all grown up.
-<i> I am the definition</i>
<i>of fishy glamour.</i>
<i>Always and forever,</i>
<i>Alyssa Edwards.</i>
- Mm.
- What's her net worth?
- [laughs]
She has a date with Moby Dick.
- Lucky.
- Lineysha Sparx.
- That is Sheila E. realness.
- If a girl answers,
don't hang up.
-<i> I am serving bawdy,</i>
<i>bawdy, bawdy,</i>
<i>and just a little bit of bitch.</i>
- You know, she's got a leg up
on the competition.
- She does.
- The 49th state, Alaska.
- Something smells fishy.
-<i> I'm holding a brook trout</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>
<i>caught in Lake Erie.</i>
<i>Grandpa would be so proud</i>
<i>and completely horrified.</i>
- Would you like a mint?
- That outfit would go great
with some tartar sauce.
- Mmm.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- It's rather pedestrian.
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your performances in
The Snatch Game
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Jade Jolie...
Coco Montrese...
Alyssa Edwards...
Alyssa, this week you let down
Katy Perry.
I want you to tweet an apology
to her tonight--
#RuPaulogy.
- Yes, ma'am.
- But last week you won immunity
from elimination.
The three of you are safe.
- Katy Perry's fans
are gonna slay me.
It was an embarrassment
to my career.
- Ladies, survey says you
represent the best and the worst
of the week.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Detox.
- The problem is, Ke$ha's not
really that much fun.
It has to be somebody
who's kind of fun.
I just don't want to hang
with Ke$ha.
- Tonight on the runway,
your side silhouette is huge...
like a ball with legs.
- The first thing I thought of
when I heard fishy fierceness
was a jellyfish.
- Really? That's the first thing
you thought of?
You're fiercer than that.
- Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- I thought you did
a wonderful job
with your portrayal of Tamar.
I had a lot of fun and giggles
with you.
- Tonight your boobs
look amazing.
I love a bedazzled muffin.
- The hair is interesting, but
I wish it was a little more
coiffed.
- Next up, the 49th state,
Alaska.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Your Lady Bunny, for me,
was absolutely hilarious.
You have incredible timing.
Absolutely fantastic.
- One thing that was kind of
missing from Bunny
was her voice.
She--it sounded more...
[deep, raspy voice] Like Roz,
you know, than it did--
[high-pitched voice]
Bunny's up here.
[high-pitched cackle]
- Next up, Ivy Winters.
- Your dress tonight I loved.
I mean, I loved the fun
and camp value
that we got with Nemo
eating you.
- [laughs]
- But with Marilyn Monroe,
you lost an icon.
What is the first thing
you think about?
[breathily]
You think about that.
[normal voice] You know...
- I think doing Marilyn Monroe
is next to impossible.
Everybody's done it.
You have to find something that
we haven't seen done to death,
in a way.
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.
- You look absolutely stunning
tonight.
Love the hair and the choker and
the glam rock with the chains
going down.
- Celia Cruz was really generic.
- It's very hard make comedy
in other language.
It's more comfortable for me
make somebody Latino.
- I think you have the skills,
but you just didn't pull it out
of that character.
- All right, next up,
Jinkx Monsoon.
Michelle Visage?
- Jinkxy, I am starting to give
up here.
It's rather pedestrian.
I'm not getting glamour.
- To me, this looks glamorous.
I have big blonde hair--
- This, to me,
is not big blonde hair.
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.
[laughter]
- We do?
- You ruled The Snatch Game.
- [giggles]
- I thought it was absolutely
brilliant,
and I think anybody
who ever does The Snatch Game
should watch what you did.
- Thank you, Jinkx.
Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
[engine turning]
All right, kids,
just between us girls...
what do you think?
Let's start with Detox.
- She looks like a blob,
and I was not happy tonight.
- I disagree.
I thought it was quite
a nice jellyfish.
- To me, it looked like two
giant shower caps--
not hot in any way.
- Did she make you laugh--
Detox?
- It just came off
as annoying skank.
- Roxxxy Andrews...
- Roxxxy nailed that modern take
on Liza with a "Z."
- As Tamar, Roxxxy rocked it.
- [laughs]
- [snaps fingers] Okay?
- Let's go way up north
to Alaska.
Santino, I thought that Alaska's
jokes were crude, rude,
offensive.
She nailed Bunny completely.
- Right on the head.
Yes, the voice was not there,
but she was consistent with her
own made-up voice for Bunny.
- I actually liked her little
fish wiggle on the runway, and,
uh, she's got the tiniest butt
I've ever seen.
- Ivy Winters.
- With someone like Marilyn
Monroe,
you really have to have
the voice down.
- I just don't know
why you'd pick Marilyn.
It seems crazy to me
that you'd pick it
if you can't do the voice
or the character.
- Lineysha Sparx.
- She's a sex shooter.
She's getting phone calls from
Prince right now
to get in his new girl group.
- Or get his outfit back.
- [laughing] Yeah.
But her Snatch Game was lost
in translation.
- It actually reminded me of my
grandma at Christmas with too
much eggnog with a karaoke mic.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- She was like the Meryl Streep
of drag queens.
- 'Cause that bitch turned it
out.
- Completely committed.
Should be committed.
- [laughs]
- I was just wondering if we'll
ever be able to get to see that
ultra-glamazon thing
from Jinkx once.
Not that this is ugly.
She's adorable.
- Who Jinkx reminds me
of is Pandora Boxx.
- Yeah.
- I actually like that dress.
It was just the way
it was styled,
the way she paired the things,
and these are things you can
learn.
- She thought that was big hair.
[laughter]
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
[sighs]
[whispering] My girls.
[laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jinkx Monsoon...
you gave us 50 shades
of<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
You've won a custom jewel
package from Fierce Drag Jewels.
- I won Snatch Game!
A life dream is coming true
today.
- Alaska...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Lineysha Sparx,
as the queen of salsa,
you lacked spice.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- To be in the bottom two
is very hard for myself.
But I don't want to go home.
- Ivy Winters,
your Marilyn Monroe was
one bland bombshell.
Detox, your Ke$ha was,
in a word...
blah, blah, blah.
Detox...
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
Ivy Winters, you are safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- I'm really well-known for
my unique style of lip-synch.
I'm ready to send
Lineysha packing.
- Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.

and there's no barrier
to how far you will soar.
Now sashay away.
[applause]
- [smooching]
- I love you,<i> mami.</i>
- This is the end for me
in this competition,
but I feel very proud to be one
of the family of<i> Drag Race.</i>
[speaking Spanish]
- Condragulations,
my crazy eight.
And remember, if you can't
love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, let the music play.

- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll be creating kidster
television shows.
- I am ready
to toss your salad.
- I like a cheesy salad.
- Vivienne, if you can bring
your energy up to meet Roxxxy...
- You're gettin' lost.
- It was pure hell.
Fuck you, Alyssa.
- Coco is always the victim.
- You committed
the number-one crime.
You bored me.
- Detox, condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Coco Montrese, shante, you stay.
Monica, sashay away.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- We're back in the workroom,
and Monica got sent home.
- I would have been incredibly
sad if Coco would have left.
I mean, she is my most closest
friend here.
I'm not going to be a yin yang
without my yin.
- So what was it like, girl?
- It taught me a big lesson
that, you know,
in this competition,
you have to focus
and concentrate
on what you're doing.
- Right.
- I haven't been focused.
In the whole competition,
Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.
I've got to shake this off
and move on.
- Vivienne, were you scared?
'Cause when you turned around,
Vivienne's face was like--
- I wanted to fucking throw up.
Are you kidding me?
I thought I was going to pull
a Willam.
I was so fucking scared.
You don't even know.
- Vivienne's critique
was basically
that she played little,
and I overshadowed her
in our scene.
She knows that she didn't shine
last week,
so she's got to shine
this week and pull through.
- At first, we were working
really well together,
and our script
was really good,
but once you get there...
At this point, I'm pissed.
I really felt like Roxxxy
overpowered me.
I think that she's
an attention whore.
- Oh, oh, my--ah!
Oh, my god.
- I personally think
that she's annoying.
I'm going to be honest.
I'd like to see Roxxxy go home.

- And it tracks the highs and

I'm a dancer.

you won the mini challenge,
so you're team captains.
All right, Coco, you pick first.
- Alyssa Edwards.
[record scratches]
- What the fuck?
- Well, well, well, I would
have never expected that.
- I'm not no dummy, y'all.
Alyssa is the best dancer,
and she's going to be
on my team.
- Hi, Jinkx.
You go next.
- Ivy Winters.
- [laughing]
- Detox.
- [laughs]
- Lineysha.
- Lineysha.
- Honey Mahogany.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
- A-loose-ka.
- [laughs]
- Oh, wow.
All right, Coco.
- God, Jade is never going to
forgive me for this.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Whoo.
- In the back of my mind,
I kind of felt that I would be
one of the first people
that she would choose.
It kind of was like a slap
to my face,
because we have been so close.
- All right, now, Vivienne
and Jade remain.
Jinkx, who do you pick?
- Jade Jolie.
- Jade Jolie goes to
Jinkx's team,
which leaves
Vivienne Pinay to Coco's team.
- Great.
I find myself again in a team
with a bunch of loudmouths.
- Now, remember, this week...
actions speak louder than words.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- All right, I would like to
read through the script
before we assign any parts.
I feel a ton of pressure being
team captain,
but I kind of
built myself up last week,
and I don't want to take
a step backwards.
All right, I'm thinking young Ru
and Diana Ross.
Then we have Lady Bunny
and gender fuck drag Ru.
- Yeah.
- Does everyone feel good
about this?
- I feel awesome about it.
- Okay.
- I've worked with
Lady Bunny before.
I've made a couple costumes
for her,
and I've gotten to know her
pretty well.
- Ru's mom, you're going to be
the comic relief
right from the get-go.
- I'm the first impression
in this ballet,
and I can't dance.
- Have you had
any formal dance training?
- [mumbles]
- [laughs]
- Can you krump dance, though?
- No, what is that?
- You know, the--
I know you can do that.
- This is--that's my
only dance move.
It's going to be a problem.
- Coming up...
- We'll make you big.
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru though, right?
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.
- Oh. Oh.
- Fuck.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Today, our main challenge
is<i> No Rupaulogies,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> the ballet,</i>
which is the story
of Rupaul's life.
I picked Alyssa for my team.
This could go
really, really good,
or this could go way south.
- In the first scene, there's
a good Ru and a bad Ru,
so there are two Ru's.
- I think it will be good
if we played the good Ru
and the bad Ru.
Ru versus Ru.
- Oh.
Oh, I see where this is going.
- Scene three is
"All my legendary children,
Ru and
America's next drag."
You gonna do Ru?
- I guess.
That's fine.
I think Vivienne should be
America's next drag superstar.
- Okay, that's fine.
- Once again, I'm in a team
with Roxxxy Andrews.
I don't like being
paired with her.
I just don't.
I don't like her energy.
- We'll put big earrings
on you.
Jewels, jewels, jewels,
and just the dress
and the shoes and the--
we'll make you big.
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru, though, right?
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.
- Oh. Oh.
- I feel like the team today is
really underestimating me.
I'm kind of just waiting for it
to blow.
- Hello, hello, hello, hello,
my private dancers.
all: Hello.
- Is everything beautiful
at the drag ballet?
all: yeah.
- Of course.
- I don't believe you.
[all laughing]
Team Jinkx, who have you
assigned the roles to?
- Well, we have Ivy
as the Lady Bunny.
We have Alaska
as Mama Ernestine.
- [laughs]
- I'm your mama.
- Yes, you are.
- And we have Jade
as little Ru.
I am playing gender fuck
21-year-old Ru.
- Oh, dear.
- Yes.
- And who is playing
'60s Diana Ross?
- That would be Miss Lineysha
here.
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?
- Um, not really, no.
- All right.
Now, Ivy, you have
history with Lady Bunny.
- I do.
- I've always wanted to know.
I know you make costumes
for her.
- Uh-huh.
- What is Lady Bunny's
real waist size?
- She's a 28.
[laughs]
- Ooh, you mean her thigh
is a 28.
[all laughing]
- Now, Ernestine is Alaska.
Where are you drawing
inspiration?
- Well, in the voiceover,
it's going to say that she had
a mouth like a sailor, so...
- Yes, she did.
Her favorite saying was...
"You pussy-mouthed
motherfucker.”
- [laughs]
- I'm going to attempt to
convey
with my flailing limbs
Ernestine's strictness,
her strength,
and a face that's like this.
- All right, kids.
I'm going to let you get back
to rehearsal.
Good luck.
all: Thank you.
- Hey, team Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?
Now, which Rupaul
are you playing?
- I am the good Ru,
and alyssa's the bad Ru.
- [laughs]
Now, is this a case
of life imitating art?
- Yeah.
- How did that come about?
'Cause I was pretty gobsmacked
when you chose Alyssa.
I thought that you guys
had a little thing.
- Well, this is a competition,
and like I said,
I'm playing to win.
- Now, who's playing
'90s supermodel Ru?
- Me.
- The glamazon.
I love it, and you're working
with '90s Diana Ross.
Have you ever done
Diana Ross before?
- I've been asked
and actually haven't--
I wasn't able to the one time
they asked me to do it, so...
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Now, Roxxxy,
you are today's Rupaul,
and you're working with
America's next drag superstar,
which would be Vivienne Pinay.
- She's just playing her
for the sketch.
She's not America's
next drag superstar.
[laughs]
- Yeah.
- Now, Vivienne,
you have been criticized
for playing it safe,
playing it small.
- Yes.
- How are you going to
overcome that?
- I, again, have a lot of
big personalities
in my--in my group.
- You absolutely do.
- After last week, I just have
to, fuck it, just be myself.
If people don't like it,
they don't like it.
- Vivienne has to step it up.
- Break a leg.
- I mean, Ru gave her
a warning last week.
I don't think he'll give her
another one.
- Gather around,
my sugar plum fairies.
Now, in a moment,
you'll be working
with two red hot
choreographers.
From Shaping Sound, Travis Wall
and Nick Lazzarini.
[clapping]
And tomorrow on the main stage,
you'll be making
your dance debut
in front of Travis and our
other extra special guest judge,
Chaz Bono.
all: Oh.
[cheering]
- Chaz.
I live for Chaz Bono.
Chaz Bono came out of
Cher's vagina.
- And opera ballet.

and all the girls

- Um...
- Jump off the right foot.
Right foot.
Almost.
And chaine out and turn around
and kiss her.
- Ah.
- A little bit more grander.
Remember, you're playing
Diana Ross.
- I'm playing the role
of Diana Ross,
and I know how to do it.
- You know who Diana Ross is?
- Lineysha's going to bomb
at this.
- All right, take your foot--
you ready for floor?
You're going to jump right,
left, right, right, back.
Back, back, back.
- That's tricky.
- Nick and Travis,
they were, like,
shooting this choreography
on me super fast.
I'm just trying to remember it.
It was so overwhelming.
- This one's really important
for timing,
so you guys have
a lot of work to do.
- If we miss a beat,
it throws off
the whole rest of the piece.
It's going to be a nightmare
if we can't get this perfect.
- Coming up...
- And jump, go.
- They're, like, hesitant.
They're just not willing to
trust each other.
- [squeals]
- Honey kind of sucks.
Watching her
was so uncomfortable.
Fuck my life.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Stretch and extend
all the way over.
Stretch that side.
Today's main challenge is,
we have to tell Rupaul's story
through the art of dance.
This is a very important
challenge to me,
because I own
and operate a dance studio.
Good, and straighten.
And fingers crossed
that everything
just falls into place.
Oh, here we go.
Here we go, they're coming.
One, two, three, four, second,
five, down, seven, up, eight,
back, one, two, three, four.
- The looks on their faces
were, like, "uh-oh."
- Oh, that's real fancy, girls.
And I about shit my pants.
- Bye, kids.
- Bye, guys.
- Psych!
And it worked.
all: Hi.
- Hey, ladies.
How are you guys?
- Good, how are you?
- Are you guys ready
to dance today?
- For sure.
- All right, so let's start
with scene number one.
- Ooh, good Ru, evil Ru.
This one's going to be good.
- After not speaking to Coco
for two years,
and the blow up last week,
and then being picked
for his team today,
I'm hoping that our chemistry
can be there
and we can really deliver.
- I think you should definitely
do the lift.
This is about
trusting each other.
Can you just take her around
this way?
And turn me and go, lift,
like, that way?
- Oof.
- Slide and jump, go.
Jump.
- Ah.
[squeals]
Owie.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Owie.
- Wait.
I feel like they're,
like, hesitant
'cause they're just not
willing to trust each other yet.
They definitely have the most
work cut out for them.
You'd run around her,
you grab her by the throat,
and then you
just let her go.
Go around, go around, go around,
go around, go around.
And then grab him by the throat.
You grab.
Mm, shake, shake, shake, shake.
- It felt so good.
- Grab her hands.
So you'll do six of these.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, passe, and right, left,
right, left, right, left, passe,
and--
- Travis decides to give us
some choreography
that's actually
a little complicated.
- Go.
Right, left.
- Down, down.
- Wait, you're holding wrong.
It's just six steps,
so as much as you can,
try to retain the choreography
just a little faster.
- Okay.
- Honey kind of sucks.
Watching her was
so uncomfortable.
Fuck my life.
- Next.
- What do you want, like--
- [laughs]
- Ooh.
- Wow.
- That's what I do.
- Roxxxy wants all the eyes
on her,
and I'm really waiting
for the moment
where she kind of
messes up,
even though she's
still in my group.
- Cue music.
Jump, jump.
Turn around, and jump.
- Shit.
- Jump.
Go over and around.
Turn, turn.
All right, cool, thank you.
- It's--yeah, it's getting--
yeah.
Roxxxy and Vivienne,
they're probably the weakest
dancers in that group,
so to have them
at the end
makes me a little bit nervous.
Remember, this is about
Ru's life.
Don't fuck it up.

Alaska.
I've been waiting to see.
- Um, it's like this.
It goes...
[trills]
- That's beautiful.
- We're all shitting our pants
a little bit.
Or a lot, in my case.
- You know, when I came back
from college,
my parents actually found
a picture of me in drag.
- Oh, my--oh.
- Like, that's
how they found out.
They basically sent me out of
the country,
'cause they were like,
"You need to get away
from your negative influences.”
- Oh, my God.
- They sent you away basically.
- They sent me to Africa.
Yeah.
I think being a gay person--
we go through things
that I think enable us
to grow in a way
that straight people
don't get to have
that experience.
- I just wish my dad
would have been
a little bit more supportive
of the whole dancing.
When you do something
that makes you so happy,
and other people
try to take your happiness,
it's sad.
We just didn't have
that father-son relationship.
It was very hard for him
to understand me.
I found myself
getting lost in music,
and that's when it sparked me
to become a choreographer.
- I think everything
that we've all gone through
has made us--
- Oh, every road.
- Absolutely.
- And for me to give back
what was given to me,
the gift of
dance and art--it's my world.
- I feel really bad about Jade.
Not picking her right away.
Oh, she didn't even--
she just walked by me
like I wasn't even here.
She's really funny with me
right now.
I got to talk to Jade.
I've been trying to talk to you
all day,
and you've just been
avoiding me.
- Girl, I'm just focused on
my challenge and being here,
just like you're focused
on being here.
My feelings were hurt that Coco
didn't pick me.
Maybe she thought that I wasn't
a strong enough player
as the other girls.
I'm very happy that you picked
the team that you wanted,
and I'm very happy with the team
that I got.
So everything worked out.
Being in the bottom two
every week
just seems to work out for me.
- Oh, girl, I don't need
this today.
I need to get ready.

head piece.
- I know you are filled
with lots of characters,

I want to know if you've got
that in you.
- I believed in
all the debauchery
that you were creating up there
on stage
as young 21-year-old Ru.
- You were so entertaining,
and it was so much fun.
I really had a great time
watching you dance.

your Lady Bunny was maybe
a little too skinny
and too pretty.

- That's a read!

- Ooh!
- All right, next up,
Roxxxy Andrews.
- This look tonight--
there is something
not quite right
in the waist and hips area.
I don't think it's as flattering
as it could be.
You're not as curvy this week.
- I certainly know
what it's like
to not be the lightest
on one's feet.
You have to kind of
make up for it
with attitude and everything,
and I thought that's where
you could have elevated
your performance.
- Next up, Vivienne Pinay.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tonight, you faded into
the woodwork again.
It's a tad pedestrian.
- Look around
at your competition
and what they're wearing.
This is really low-key.
- I think you're actually one
of the most
beautiful queens

- Hey, wait, hold up a minute.

your performance
and, just, I feel like

Who do you think deserves to go
home tonight and why?

- Vivienne.
- Vivienne?

um, I don't see Jade
at the same level.

will deliberate.
All righty.

Let's talk.
What do you think?
Starting with Jinkx Monsoon.
- I do want to see other sides
to Jinkx
that I don't think
we've gotten to yet.
- If she can pull off
the glamazon,
we've got a real contender
on our hands.
- Her dancing wasn't
phenomenal,
but I think she
really made up for that
with committing
to her character.
- Ivy Winters.
- Nobody's more in on the joke
than Bunny,
and Ivy really
played that well.
- Did Lady Bunny ever lift you
up like that, Ru?
- Usually I saw her going down.
[laughter]
Roxxxy Andrews.
- She's out there playing you.
Honest to God, it's been so long
since I've seen you go out
in a leotard.
- She had a tall order
to play you now,
and the "it" thing
that you've got,
I didn't see up on the stage.
- All right, up next
is Honey Mahogany.
Now, here she is, playing
my idol, Diana Ross.
- I found myself watching
Detox the whole time.
- Tonight,
she comes up here again
with a sequin kaftan,
and this, you know, hodge podge.
It was all just whatever.
- Alyssa Edwards,
who is a trained dancer.
Regardless of her technique
and her background as a dancer,
she had the story in her head,
and we could see that.
- I mean,
she just looked so hot,
and I love her walk.
- She danced from head to toe,
between her hands and her toes.
Everything, she articulated
through her entire body,
and it was amazing.
- All right, moving on to
Vivienne Pinay.
- Talk about not delivering.
Even being the crowned drag
superstar--
No, you weren't.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- You were just a regular girl
putting a crown on at the mall.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughs]
[laughs]
- Welcome back, ladies.
This week,
you were all dance troupers,
but one of you stood out
as the prima drag ballerina.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
Alyssa Edwards.
[all applauding]
You've won a custom feather
piece from Mother Plucker,
and you'll receive immunity
from elimination next week.
- I'm at a loss for words,
and that doesn't happen much.
I'm just very thankful.
- Ivy Winters...
you're safe.
- Thank you all.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Honey Mahogany,
as Diana Ross,
we were not swept away.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
Roxxxy Andrews, we challenged
you to step it up,
and you fell short.
Vivienne Pinay,
you are making progress,
but this week,
it was not measured
in leaps and bounds.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you are safe.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
- You may join the other girls.
- Vivienne Pinay,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come.
You need to lip sync
for your life.
- The anger that I have
is preventing me
from being nervous.
Fuck it.
I'm going to do it
to the best of my ability,
because I owe it to myself.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Honey Mahogany.
Vivienne Pinay.
I'm sending you both home.
I'm sorry, my dears.
Neither one of you showed me
the fire it takes to stay.
- In the history
of<i> Rupaul's Drag Race,</i>
there has never been
a double elimination.
- Double elimination?
Of course, it is.
Why wouldn't it be?
- Now, ladies, sashay away.
- I do have talent,
and I do have,
I think, what it takes
to be a performer.
If I could do something
differently,
I would have not worn
this kaftan.
Maybe I just need to
hire a stylist.
- I'm upset, obviously,
because I want to be here
to the end,
but I am beautiful,
and nobody can
take that away from me.
I will always be
the fishiest queen.
Today, tomorrow, next month,
the past seasons,
and the next seasons to come.
- Ladies, from here on out,
I will not tolerate
no half stepping.
Bring me your best.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- [laughs]
Now, let the music play.

- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you'll be starring in two soaps.
Telenovela style.
- Son of a bitch.
It's another acting challenge.
- I have to reform Relaskatox.
- I don't want the judges to
see me relying on a clique.
- Chimichanga!
- [gasps] Oh!
Ay! Ay! Si! Si! Si!
Oy! Oy!
- Alyssa, you need to at least
match what Jinkx is doing.
- That dress is the worst dress
I've ever seen in five seasons.
- When you go to the clubs,
you don't ask the girls,
"Did you sew that,
did you make that?"
I am an entertainer.
- Alyssa,
that's not what this is about.
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
Coco Montrese,
shante, you stay.
Alyssa Edwards, sashay away.
- Girl...
- Agh!
Going into the workroom,
it really was a sweet moment
to see Alyssa leave the stage.
- "The sky is the limit
when your heart's in it."
- How do you feel?
- I feel free.
I feel a weight
lifted off of me.
- Are you making another
fat joke about her?
- Oh! Miss Jinkx!
- I'm happy that this book
is closed.
- Coco believes
that this has closed
a big chapter in her life.
So the hope now
is that she doesn't take
all of that Alyssa aggression
and put it on one of us.
- Now it's time to be
America's next drag superstar.
Thank you, girls.
all: Ooh...
- Jinkx, you bitch.
You're the first one
to win two challenges.
- It was such a toss-up
between you and 'Laska.
- Jinkx is my biggest
competition.
She's really funny,
and so am I, so...
[clicks tongue]
- And Roxxxy was in the top
three too.
- We're trying to get Jinkx
out of here.
She's a big threat, and I don't
know where I got to get you,
but I got to find
somewhere that you lack.
- RuPaul, can we please sew
something for next week?
- No sewing, Ru!
- So I can win a damn challenge!
- Let's just hope
I have enough fabric
to braid myself another dress.
[laughs]
- I'm sorry, my dear.
Your sewing looks like shit.
- I just feel like
there are people
who are just waiting for me
to screw up big-time.
- Your sewing looks like
Coco's performance.
Shit.
- It's turned quickly from

We're back in the workroom,
it's a new week,
and I am terrified
of messing up now.
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail!
Sometimes a drag queen's gotta
do what a drag queen's gotta do,
whether it's laying a foundation
or painting the house down.
You've got to spackle,
Neely, spackle!
- [laughs]
- Remember the golden shower
rule:
Do unto others
as you would have them
do unto Ru.
- Oh...
- What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- Now, to keep you
in fighting shape,
for today's mini challenge,
you're going to go to...
drag booty camp.
- Oh...
- [chuckles]
- So put on your workout gear,
including heels by Le Dame
and boobs from
The Breast Form Store.
Go!
- Ooh.
- Le Dame.
- This must be
what my mom feels like.
Yeah, yeah.
- Ladies, meet your
personal trainer.
From Barry's Bootcamp, Storm.
- Mash.
- Now, the one queen
that outlasts the others...
wins.
- Ooh.
- Let's get it up, come on.
I don't know,
but I've been told.
all: I don't know,
but I've been told.
- Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.
all: Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.
- Pump it, girls.
Pump it, ladies.
Keep that energy up.
Jinkx, you took off your heels.
- They fell off!
- Come on, you call yourself
a drag queen?
- Here we go, ladies.
- Pull up.
Come on, count it off.
- I don't like working out
around other people.
I get ugly when I work out.
- Get up, get up, get up!
- [grunting]
- Detox, you're out.
Keep crunching, come on.
Coco, you're out.
Keep it going.
Roxxxy, you're out.
Up!
It's just between
Jinkx and Alaska.
Come on, now.
- Finally, my opportunity
to push Jinkx
down the proverbial stairs.
- Who's gonna be the last queen
crunching?
- Oh, Jinkx is out.
Alaska wins.
[clapping]
- Whoo-hoo!
Let's do some more!
- Alaska, condragulations.
- Thank you.
- Bye, ladies.
I'll see you at the gym.
- See ya there.
Not really.
- Now, you ladies have bravely
soldiered
through challenge
after challenge.
Now it's time to give back
to those who have
sacrificed so much
to serve this great nation.
Oh, boys!
- [gasps]
- God bless America.
- These gentlemen,
who also happen to be gay,
served our country
before the repeal
of "Don't ask, don't tell."
Thanks to these men,
we have the freedom
to be fierce.
And now, you get to exercise
that freedom
by enlisting these men
into your drag house.
- Oh, shit.
I'm nervous, 'cause I've never
done anyone else's makeup.
- Now, Alaska,
you won the mini challenge,
so you get to pair
the queens with their vets.
- Well, everything happens
for a reason...
- Uh-huh.
- And these men came in
in this order for a reason.
So I want to go straight down
the line, so--Izzy, is it?
- Yes.
- You are going to be
with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Alaska tells RuPaul,
"Everything happens
for a reason."
I think it was sabotage.
I thought we were closer
than this.
It pissed me off.
- Dave, you're going
to be with Jinkx Monsoon.
- Hi, Dave.
- You'll have so much fun
with Jinkx.
Jinkx is my biggest
competition right now,
so maybe it would be an
impediment having an older man.
Steve, you're going
to be with Coco.
- So big and strong.
- Aaron, you're going
to be with lady Detox.
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- And, Alaska,
that means you have Mack.
- I think pairing myself
with the tall, pretty one
is probably
a really good strategy.
- Now, ladies,
we're gonna be looking
for a strong family resemblance.
A true expression of your drag.
Attention!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...
win!
- So you've never,
ever been in drag before?
- No, I have not.
- Okay.
[laughs]
Who are some of your
diva inspirations?
- Uh...
Judy Garland.
- I can see us doing a Judy/Liza
kind of thing together.
- I knew Judy, by the way.
- You did?
- Yes.
- You knew Judy Garland?
What was she like?
- She was actually really nice.
- That's amazing.
I feel like the luckiest drag
queen in this room right now,
'cause I know these young guys
don't have stories like that.
And look, Detox
is more concerned
about sleeping with her, um...
- I can tell.
- Ha!
- Even though I got paired up
with the oldest vet,
I get to work
with one of the sweetest,
coolest people in the room.
- We have to give you body.
- Okay.
- Stand up for me.
- You can't tell in these pants,
but I have a big butt.
- Do you have a big butt?
That's perfect,
'cause I have a huge ass.
Oh, it is a nice butt.
We're still gonna
make it bigger.
- I got a really hot guy.
Like, ah, Jesus.
He's really sweet, and a total
sissy, and I really like that.
I just want all you bitches
to pay attention really quick.
And let Aaron show you
how it's fucking done.
- Oh, my God,
she's done this before.
- I love it!
- I'm not happy at all.
Izzy is shorter
and he's hairy.
I'm pissed.
- Coming up...
Can we see a little bit
of her walk?
- Yeah.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.
- I got--I got it.
- Really?
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Today, we have to make over
our gay vet.
Have you ever worn Leg Avenue?
- [laughs]
No.
- And we have to do a complete
family resemblance runway look.
Is that the Michael Levine
fabric?
Oh, my God,
we're gonna be gorgeous.
[chuckles]
- Give me a little runway.
Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my God, hold on.
I got to see this.
You look like Jennifer Lopez
as Jesus.
[laughs]
- I got another thing comin'
for y'all.
I have a fuel under my ass.
He's going to be
drop-dead gorgeous.
- Get naked.
Let's try this on you.
I'm having a difficult time
working with my partner
because he's fucking beautiful.
[whistles]
So do you have a boyfriend
or anything?
- No.
- Thank you, gay God.
I just got lady wood
for you walking.
- If Detox doesn't
win this challenge,
she'll have no one
to blame but herself.
Here, put on these.
- Okay.
You got to understand
that bending over
can be a trip sometimes.
I have a medical condition.
In fact, I fell down
the other day.
- Dave's kind of top-heavy,
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around.
Hold my hand.
Focus on walking on your toes
a little bit more.
It's a distinct possibility
I'm going to be
in the bottom two tomorrow.
Okay.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.
- I got--I got it.
- You okay?
This big, buff man
in camouflage pants
and a pair of heels...
I never thought I'd be putting
a man's breasts on.
- [laughs]
- Oh, God, Steve,
we've got to pull this off.
'cause if I'm in the bottom two,
this may be my last supper.
- You haven't?
- Uh-uh.
- Well, how'd you
get yours, then?
- My friend made them for me.
- Oh.
- I've seen
a YouTube video of it.
All I have is a pair of scissors
and this really hard foam,
and so I'm just hoping
they'll look passable.
What inspired you to, like,
get into the military?
- I grew up in foster care,
and my 18th birthday,
my foster mom was like,
"You have to find a place
to live.
I'll give you a week."
and so I joined the military,
and I got out of it structure,
discipline...
- Wow.
- And now I'm ready
to be out on my own.
- It shows a great
amount of wisdom.
He said, "My life needs order
that I never got."
It's very admirable.
All right, now remember,
you're a woman, not a man.
Walk softly.
Mack is walking
like a Mack truck driver.
Ladies take soft steps.
Any advantage I thought I had
because of Mack's appearance
completely vanishes
because of the way
that he is holding himself.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- Oh, dear, I see
lots of titties up in here.
Hello, Jinkx and Dave.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- How's it going over here?
- He and I decided we're going
to do a Judy and Liza tribute.
- Oh, my goodness.
- And I've got the backstory.
- Tell me about that.
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.
[record needle scratch effect]
We were talking
one night at dinner,
and she asked me
about the new sleeping pills
that were out.
I told her about a new one,
and she died of an overdose.
- Dave has got Ru speechless.
How do you respond to, "I think
I killed Judy Garland"?
He's a monsoon, all right.
- Well, you know, Dave, she
worked real hard to get there.
All right, listen,
you kids get back to work,
and I can't wait to see ya.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- All right.
House of Alaska.
Mack has big, old titties,
no makeup,
and your skin is perfect.
- Oh, you haven't seen
my walk yet.
- Well, right, uh...
- Can we see a little bit of it?
- It's a work in progress.
It's hard breaking
the man out of Mack.
- Really?
The Armed Services
pushed it inside of you.
I--that came out wrong.
- [laughs]
- You have a lot of work to do.
You better sissy
that walk, Mack.
- You got it, Ru.
- I'll see you guys later.
Detox and Aaron.
Oh, my goodness,
you are working on it already.
- Hi, Ru.
She's my little baby doll.
The first thing
out of her mouth was,
"I need to put shoes on now,"
and she's been sissying
that walk up and down
this entire workroom.
- Good, good.
- [laughs]
- So, Aaron,
Don't Ask Don't Tell--
how has that
affected your life?
- I've served before and after.
And serving before,
it was tough, because I was,
you know, 22 and living
in the Castro,
and, like, gay, gay, gay.
- Yeah.
- And it was such culture shock
coming back in the closet.
- What's it like now?
- It takes
a little weight off you.
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's nice to be able to,
without fear of repercussion,
just really be that person.
- I'm so happy that
you are here with us,
and that you are out and proud,
and I cannot wait to see you.
- Me too.
- Thank you, Ru.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- The house of Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, you've got some
wide hips, there.
Have you done drag before?
- No, never, Ru.
- Never.
- I feel, like,
how do they do that?
I mean, you guys got balls,
seriously.
- Oh, yeah, we do have balls.
- [laughs]
- Steve, now what made you
join the military?
- I always had an issue with
my--with being homosexual.
It was a way for me
to become straight.
I thought I would go in there,
they'll buff you up,
and yell at you.
- When you hear that,
you think about the other guys
that did it too.
Why can't people just let people
be who they are?
- I was young, I was stupid...
- Yeah.
- The Marines did teach me,
you know, how to be a man,
and how to not take things
so seriously.
- A lot like drag.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Now, let me tell ya,
Coco needs your help.
She was in the bottom two
last week.
- Ya gotta bring that up, Ru?
Really?
- She's counting on you
to be a fierce queen.
- [laughs]
- All right, kids,
get back to it.
I will see you
on the main stage.
- Bye, Ru.
- Roxxxy and Izzy--now, Izzy,
have you ever done drag before?
- Never.
- Have you ever worn heels
before?
- Never.
- So are you gonna show a little
of the--[clicks tongue]
You know, 'cause that's what
the Andrews are famous for.
Do you have any peanut butter?
- No.
- [sighs]
- What's the biggest challenge,
in this challenge, for you?
- I want to make sure that
whatever I'm making her,
that she is gonna feel
comfortable 100%.
- Well, I'll let you
get back to it, okay?
- Okay.
By no way, shape, or form do I
think I'm done and feeling good.
- All right,
gather round, everybody!
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges,
two men who know
a lot about makeovers.
From<i> What Not To Wear,</i>
Clinton Kelly will be here.
[cheers and applause]
And from<i> The Fashion Police,</i>
George Kotsiopoulos.
[cheers and applause]
Oh, and one more little thing.
In addition to
walking the runway,
each team needs to come up with
a patriotic
color guard presentation.
So raise your flag high
and don't fuck it up.
Coming up...
- Mack is extremely manly.
- Oh!
We don't know what the fuck
we're doing.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- How do you feel at it?
- I feel alive.
- Our main challenge today
is to make gay veterans
into part of our drag family,
and to come up with a color
guard routine
to present on the runway.
Hmm, hmm, three...
- Oh, fuck.
- We don't know
what the fuck we're doing.
We haven't really
planned anything,
we're kind of making it up
as we go.
Oh!
[laughs]
Closer.
[sighs]
Do you have any ideas?
- Turn, turn, turn.
And turn around.
- Turn around.
- Don't fall, don't fall.
- I won't fall, I'm good.
- Those shoes
are killing you, huh?
Steve is determined to do
his rehearsal in these heels,
but the aches and pains
are all over his face.
Ah!
- Shut up.
- I think as much as Steve
wants to be prepared
for what it takes
to be in these heels...
Take 'em off.
Yeah, just take 'em off.
I don't think
he was ready for this.
- Oh, uh-uh.
- No?
- Oh, no, baby.
I'm gonna fall off of these.
- Are they too high?
- Yeah.
- I don't want you
to hurt yourself.
- I mean, I do have
a medical condition, you know?
- What's that?
- I will be honest with you.
And, uh, I took a medicine, and
it caused me to look like this.
It also wasted the muscles
in my legs.
I just can't hold myself up.
- Okay. We're gonna
find a way to work with it.
- Okay.
- I mean, there's a million
and one things
we can do to overcome this.
And we're a team.
You're not in this alone.
- I'll be right back.
- [whimpers]
Dave is surviving with HIV,
and his body went through
a massive transformation,
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around,
let alone walk in heels,
but Dave's heart is so in it
that he wants
to give it his all.
We're gonna work with it,
not against you.
- Pop that foam, girl.
Pop that foam.
Hey, how you doin'?
[laughter]
I love it.
And...
Can we do that together, though?
- I'm just scared.
I'm scared, I'm scared,
I'm scared.
- All right.
I don't know what color guard
or flag twirling is.
So let's start
from sword fighting.
- And then like that,
and then what if I took
this one away
and then touched yours?
And then, you pull it back.
You're, like... [groans]
[laughs]
Like you just touched my dick,
or my sword fantasy,
whatever you call it.
- Well.
We're figuring it out
a lot on the fly.
[mimics marching music]
Um...
and then what?
- Dave is using the flag
as a cane,
both for comedic
and practical reasons,
but I choreographed our piece
to be well within
his capability.
Come on, Mama!
Come on!
And give the Judy Garland
a little swagger.
I have been trying to pull away
from camp and schtick
in this competition,
but I would rather him be safe
than try to lay all this
complicated choreography on him.
It's me and my mama!
- [laughs]
- Do one around.
- Uhh!
- Mama,
your skirt's falling down!
- I know.
- Oh, Mama!
Tomorrow, I wanna win
for Dave's sake.
- It is time to become women.
- Let's do this.
- Ready or not, here comes Mama!
- Today's elimination day.
I have a bunch of things
to do with Izzy.
We have to get him shaven.
It's time to get some clippers
and get this hair off of him.
[razor vibrates]
Blah! Uhh!
I hate body hair.
- [laughs]
- Fish, dude.
Let's get this chest.
Izzy turned out to be an angel.
He knows that whatever
he has to do to help us win,
he's gonna do it.
He's definitely being a trooper,
no pun intended.
[laughter]
[spits]
You're the only hairy one here?
That's okay 'cause guess what?
We can get rid of hair.
They can't get rid
of those faces.
- Exactly.
- All makeup, no talent.
- "All makeup, no talent"?
Is that what you're saying,
Coco?
Coco and Steve are throwing
a lot of shade,
but let's see when
the faces come out,
'Cause Coco don't know
how to paint faces.
- She's making you a black girl.
- I am not!
- You are, girl!
- All that makeup on his face!
- [laughs]
- Get the fuck away from me,
Detox.
Shit.
I don't paint
other people's face.
That's not something
you can learn overnight,
and I got a few hours.
- Horchata looks like a cross
between one of the Jackson 5s
and a member from<i> Cats.</i>
- Oh, shit.
I look scary.
- Am I doing this right?
You know I don't know
how to glue down brows.
Sweetie, we're in a competition.
I can't help you
or your manly man.
- But look how pretty he is.
- Tell me what happened
when you were discovered
to be a homosexual
in the service.
- The house that I had
in Washington, D.C.,
we had four of us,
two Marines and two sailors.
We decided we wanted to go
to our favorite gay bar
in full uniform, what we called
"high drag" in those days.
There was a spy.
It got back to the base,
and all four of us
were put on notice that
we were going to be discharged
for being gay.
- He's been through everything
that you could guess
a 67-year-old gay veteran
could have possibly
been through.
- One of the boys ended up
being court-martialed
because, in those days,
it was illegal to be gay,
and he ended up in Leavenworth
ward for a year.
- It's so important
to learn about the struggles
that people like Dave have been
through to get us the rights
that we take for granted.
- So that car accident
that you were in--
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened there?
- I was leaving a gig,
and apparently,
there was this guy who got
kicked out of the bar.
He left his car parked
in the middle of the freeway
with no lights on
and was sleeping in his car.
We just ran into him
going 80 or 90 miles an hour.
My face kind of ricocheted
off the windshield,
and I lost, like,
this part of my forehead.
I severed the main artery
in my head, and...
- Oh, my God.
- Like, almost bled out
in a matter of minutes.
- Jesus Christ.
Did that change anything
about you?
- I didn't leave the house
for, like, two months
because I just felt like
such a Frankenstein.
After the accident,
it was pretty traumatizing
because I was in the hospital
for so long,
and I was really weak.
I was so depressed.
I would go visit drag shows,
and they really kinda
pulled me out of that,
and, were, like,
"Just get back into it, girl.
You look fine, you'll be good."
Getting back into doing drag and
throwing myself into my work
really helped me,
but I still can't
grow eyebrows on this side.
Luckily, I can paint them on.
[snickers]
I just pull it down
and then take the rest
of your weed whacker
and pull it all the way back.
- That's not gonna hurt?
- No, just try it.
- [laughs]
- Now, what do you tape it to?
- You pull the tape
up to your butt.
[tape ripping]
It's time for Steve to tuck,
and this is a process.
A very long process.
How the fuck do you do this?
The bucket's slipping out.
- Do I have to come back there
and put it up for you?
'Cause I will.
- Oh, looks like camel toe.
- Camel toe is in this season.
[chuckling]
- [whistles]
Can't walk in it.
- Coming up...
- You were making
major missteps.
- And that was not glamorous.
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.
- Just show us a smile
from time to time.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
[laughs]

- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
for those about
to frock, we salute you.
- Ahoy!
- The great Santino.
- You look gorgeous, Ru.
- Thank you.
From<i> What Not To Wear,</i>
Clinton Kelly!
Guess what I'm not wearing.
[laughter]
Makeup.
[laughter]
It's true.
-<i> Au naturel,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I love it.</i>
- And, from<i> The Fashion Police,</i>
George Katsiopoulos.
Now, are you excited to be here?
- This is more exciting
than the Academy Awards.
Are you kidding me?
- [laughs]
- I love this show!
- So happy to have you here.
This week, we challenged our
queens to earn their stripes
by transforming gay veterans
into members
of their drag family.
Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
- Immediately, I drop a flag.
Bam!
Fuck.
- Our flag routine is fun,
goofy, and weird, just like me.
- Horchata is turning it out.
She's smiling.
She's buckin'.
She's doing her thing.
- Every time I looked over
at Isabella,
she was doing exactly
what she needed to do.
Could not have gone any better.
I think we might
pull through tonight.
- Commence shakedown.
- Ladies, forward march.
From the house of Monsoon,
Jinkx and Fortuna.
- Judy looks more like Liza
these days.
- Yes!
- We are serving mama
and gypsy realness.
I think we really hit the nail
on the head with this one.
Meet me in the middle
and give 'em a little hip!
Here we go, and, oh!
You got it!
[laughter]
Now, that's enter-taint-ment.
The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
- That's the Andrews sisters.
- Uh-huh.
- Bam!
- The look on Izzy's face--
she is feeling it.
She is loving it.
Yeah, bitches, get into it.
- The missing Kardashian
sisters.
- Big booties
must run in the family.
- Yeah.
- The house of Alaska
featuring
Alaska and Nebraska,
cat burglars.
- Okay, that's more
like Miss Nebraska
'cause she is a beauty queen.
- Yes.
- We're feeling good.
We're skipping down the runway.
I'm very proud
of little Nebraska.
- I didn't know Patty Hearst
had daughters.
- Uh-huh.
[laughter]
- The house of Detox:
Detox and Bethadone,
hunting for red October.
- Bethadone and I are stomping
it out and being playful,
and you can just tell that
he's living for himself,
which is the purpose
of this whole challenge.
- America the booty-ful.
Lucky for these girls,
it's fleet week.
The house of Montrese!
Coco and Horchata Montrese.
Mm, I'm thirsty.
- Horchata's giving you nothing
but pure showgirl,
and I'm giving you
nothing but red carpet,
Montrese-style.
- Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.
- Is that your boa, or are you
just ready to flock me?
- [laughs]
Coming up...
- The boots are just
unforgivable.
I hate them.
- Those pads, it looks like
there's hams in there.
- You seem very upset.
- It was a shit show.
- [laughs]
Welcome, ladies!
First up, the house of Monsoon,
Jinkx and Fortuna.
Dave, let's take a look
at your before.
And look at you now.
- As complicated
as your choreography was,
you were both in sync
with one another,
and it wasn't overly complicated
where you were dropping things
or making major missteps.
- You did have
a very difficult task
dressing someone in their 60s,
and I actually wouldn't change
anything about the styling.
I think you guys look
incredible.
- Well, Dave, I'm honored
to have you here,
especially since you're one of
the queens from back in the day.
- I thought you were gonna say
"The oldest."
- [laughs]
- That would be Michelle.
[laughter]
- Up next:
The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
Now, this is Izzy before,
and this is Isabella.
So how do you feel, Izzy?
- I feel like I could give
Santino a mustache ride.
- [shouts]
- Come on with it!
- One thing about
the house of Andrews:
We're hos, miss thang, and this
one came right into it.
- You are absolutely gorgeous.
I love that you did
the traditional Andrews ass,
and you really look like
family members.
- Wow.
- You were in perfect unison
for most of the routine,
which was really fun,
and, Isabella,
that booty shake was seriously
grade A.
I mean,
I could not get over that.
- Next up,
from the house of Alaska,
Alaska, the 49th state,
and Nebraska, the 37th state.
- Ohh.
- Mack, let's take a look
at your before picture,
and let's take
a look at you now.
Ooh, ooh!
Nebraska, tell me about
the challenge.
What was the hardest part?
- I was a little bit
uncomfortable at the beginning,
and as soon as she
brought out the weapons
and I was in the gear,
I was ready for battle.
- Stop using sex
as a weapon, Nebraska.
- [laughs]
- Well, didn't you get
the pretty pearl?
I mean, Nebraska came out,
and I was, like, "Whoa!"
The flag routine
didn't really come off
the way you wanted it to.
I think there were things
out of sync
and falling apart
here and there.
- Those hip pads, I mean,
it looks like there's
hams in there.
- You had, like,
the perfect model to work with,
and it just makes me sad
to see lumpy padding,
and the boots
are just unforgivable.
I just hate--I hate them.
- All right.
Next up: The house of Detox,
Detox and Bethadone.
- Hello.
- This is Aaron before,
and look at you now.
So, Bethadone, what was tougher:
Basic training
or getting up into drag?
- I'm definitely gonna
have to say basic training...
[laughter]
But this definitely wasn't easy.
- I'm interested in why Detox
put that bow in the front
after we read Roxxxy
down for that.
- Oh, 'cause I don't
pay attention to Roxy.
[laughter]
- But you should
pay attention to critiques.
- That performance,
you dropped the flag.
They got twisted up.
God, it was just--
- It was a shit show.
- Bethadone looked like
she was having a lot of fun.
She was really smiling,
and you didn't seem to be
having as much fun.
Just show us a smile
from time to time.
- All right, next up:
The house of Montrese,
Coco and Horchata.
Now, this is Steve before,
and look at you now.
Steve, what was the hardest part
of it for you?
- The heels and the makeup.
- Good, then, it's working.
- [chuckles]
- You guys really went
for, like, the Olympics here
with your flag routines.
It's not necessary.
- I can tell
that you've never done
someone else's hair and makeup.
There's subtle blending
and highlighting
that you didn't do.
- And the irregular hem makes
it seem like you made a gown
for yourself and you gave
your sister the scraps
that were kind of left over.
- You seem very upset.
- It seems like every week,
I'm letting you down,
letting you down,
letting you down.
- Listen, it's part of the game
of being criticized by judges.
I've been in front of any kind
of critic you can imagine.
Have fun with it.
As an entertainer, you know
that if you're not having fun,
the audience doesn't have fun.
You just gotta remember that.
I'm so proud that we got
to share this with these fellas
from the military
and showing them
what they were fighting for.
They don't tell them that
when they enroll,
that you're fighting for our
freedom to dress up in drags.
This is a fabulous country!
And I'm so proud, right now,
to be an American citizen.
All right, a little ki-ki
on the stage.
- Ohh!
- Thank you, ladies,
and thank you, veterans.
Now, while you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, now, just between us
civilians, what do you think?
Jinkx Monsoon and Fortuna.
- When she and Fortuna came out
with their flag routine,
I thought, "Jinkx is going
to be in the bottom,"
but I have to tell you,
she made up for it and then some
with her mother-daughter Gypsy
Rose Lee and Mama routine.
- My only criticism would be
that Dave is 67,
but Fortuna looks
a little bit older than that.
- The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
- It wasn't too complicated,
but what they did do,
it was well practiced,
well rehearsed.
Roxy did a bang-up job.
- Well, I love the Mini-Me vibe
that they were giving out,
and oh, my God,
they should just win
on that padding alone
because I didn't even know
it was padding.
It was amazing.
- What did you think of house
of Alaska and Nebraska?
- I think Alaska
needs to work on her craft.
That transformation
was really weak
compared to
what she had to work with.
- I was not as compelled
by Alaska
as I was by Nebraska,
and I think that's a problem.
- Moving on to the house
of Detox and Bethadone.
- The complicated flag twirling
was a mess, seriously.
- They look like deranged
Raggedy Ann dolls,
and I'm just questioning
whether or not
there's a taste level there.
- Coco and Horchata Montrese.
- Poor Horchata.
I mean, poor, poor Horchata.
- That was not glamorous.
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.
You know, I'm thinking Coco
might need to go
back to beauty school.
- The flag show was a disaster,
and she would never
let herself go out
with a busted-up face like that.
- Never, ever.
- No?
- Please.
- It was like Frida Kahlo.
It was a giant eyebrow
walking down the stage.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
[laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Jinkx Monsoon, your Liza
and Judy-inspired drag
took us over the rainbow.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- I'm safe.
- Roxxxy Andrews, you set out
to turn a salty seaman
into your sexy sister.
Mission accomplished.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
- Girl, you won!
- You and your drag sister have
each won a shopping spree
at American Apparel.
Izzy can decide
if he wants to shop
in the men's
or the women's department.
- Female.
- Gah!
This is my second win.
Finally.
- Coco Montrese.
Tonight, you didn't give us
what we were thirsty for.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Oy.
- Oy.
- [speaks Spanish]
- For the fourth time,
doesn't look too good.
- Alaska, your cross-country
crime spree
didn't steal the show.
Detox, your Marine makeover
hit a snafu.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alaska, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance
of<i> (it takes) Two</i>
by Seduction featuring
Michelle Visage.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- On a scale of one to ten,
my lip-synching
is probably a 25.
- Ready, set, go.
Let's do this.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Detox, shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- I'm sorry.
- Coco Montrese,
I want you to hear this.
You never let me down,
and I am cuckoo for Coco.
Now sashay away.
- [crying]
Thank you.
[whispers]
Thank you.
- Thank you.
[indistinct chatter]
- This is one of the most
amazing experiences of my life.
I did my best.
I think Alyssa and I can put
the past behind us.
I gained a lot of closure, which
I probably would have never got
if it wasn't for RuPaul,
so I'm very happy.
- My fab four.
Condragulations.
Victory is yours!
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.

- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Coco Montrese.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- The pageant
tore our friendship apart.
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later.
- Jinkx, on the runway,
I think you should have prepared
more than one look.
- Every week I've done
a different look.
- Bullshit.
Jinkx, she's all comedy
and no glamour.
- You will be creating
your own signature fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Alyssa's Secret.
- What is Alyssa's secret?
- Son of a bitch.
- Can we see your background?
- New York City.
- Uh, that's Tokyo.
- Oh, is it?
- I have a crush
on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- Red, for filth.
Are you red-y for me?
- Alaska, you're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ha-ha!
- Alyssa Edwards,
shantay, you stay.
Ivy, sashay away.
- Aw, Ivy Winters.
- "I love you girls so much.
You always have a friend in me."
- Girl, she is
an amazing person.
- Yeah.
- Amazing, amazing.
Ivy and I were really connecting
and really feeling very close.
And the person who's been
such a good friend to me
is now gone.
- Coco, now I know
what it feels like
to be in the bottom,
twice.
- Was it horrifying
being up there again?
- No, I'm a performer, baby.
This is what I do.
So if I have to
lip sync for my life
all the way to the final,
I'll do what I got to do.
- So what you're saying
to me is,
"Well, it doesn't matter
about the challenges.
If I fall short every time,
I'll just lip sync my way back."
- I'm confident about
performance.
I'm not confident in my acting.
That horrible cologne commercial
and that Katy Perry and that--
- But those are our challenges.
- Listen, let me explain
something to you.
- No, you're not my mama,
don't explain nothing to me,
sweetie.
- Some people should just
call a spade a spade
and say,
"Hey, I like competition.
I just don't like the work
that comes along with it."
- Coco, you and I need to talk
about something too.
Something that keeps getting
said to me and to Alaska.
I feel like I've been labeled
as a comedy queen
in a belittling way, and--
- Oh, my God.
- There's a double standard
going on right now.
When I do well
in the challenges,
they just kind of
roll their eyes
because I don't have
their respect.
I am working just as hard as
anyone else here at everything.
- Jinkx--
- And to say that you're just
a comedy queen is belittling...
- Jinkx--
- Something I have made my whole
career on--I am talking.
It is something
I work very hard at.
- How many times have y'all
called us pageant queens?
- Jinkx, I told you the same
thing when you brung this up.
That you said "pageant queen."
- That's all I had to say.
- Oh.
- These pageant girls
keep telling me,
"I don't want to be a pageant
girl for the rest of my life."
Well, then, fucking stop
calling me the comedy queen.
I'm sick of that.
- Of course, the pageant girls
are going to discount
the comedy freaks.
The best revenge
is just to do better.

[overlapping greetings]
For today's mini-challenge,
we're going to play
the crying game...
- Oh, no.
- Where you need to cry on cue.
Tears.
So put on some mascara
and meet me
in the sharing circle.
Alaska,
cry me a river.
- Sebastian and I were wed,
but suddenly, last summer,
everything changed.
- It was my first dance recital
ever.
I waved bye to Grandma.
Bye.
- I knew that one day
I wanted to become a woman.
[sobs]
- I know this will be
hard to believe,
seeing as I'm the most polished,
prettiest drag queen here.
- Being an Orange County
housewife...
is not as glamorous
as it seems.
My husband,
he was addicted to sex.
- It gets so hard
being called the bearded lady.
[sobs]
- Separate rooms
on our second honeymoon.
[sobbing]
Oh, God.
- There's nothing more sad
than the tears of a drag queen.
- Maybe it's just time for me
to go home
to Seattle.
- Jinkx was supposed to be
making me cry,
but she was making me laugh.
[laughs]
- [sobs]
- I gave that man everything
I had.
- Detox.
- Um, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm having a hard time
with this challenge.
It's hard for me to even try to
be in character right now.
I really want to be
just completely honest
and just say how difficult
this is.
[sniffles]
I lost my boyfriend
two years ago...
and looking around the room
and seeing
mournful-looking characters,
and I feel like I felt
the day that I saw him dead.
And it's really hard for me
to try to stay out of that
right now.
[sniffles]
[sobs]
I'm not used to being
so vulnerable
and looking so vulnerable,
and I feel very uncomfortable.
- Thank you for sharing
your story.
- I'm so glad that she is
sharing her story.
And it's never something
that's gonna get easy.
But something that every time
you talk about,
will make it easier.
- Okay, girls,
no more tears.
Ladies, thanks again
for sharing.
The two winners of today's
mini-challenge are...
Detox and Alyssa.
Condragulations.
[applause]
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be starring
in two primetime soaps.
And you'll be doing it...
telenovela style.
- Son of a bitch.
And it's another
acting challenge.
- One script is<i> Casa de Locas.</i>
House of the Crazies.
The other,<i> Ella No es Dama.</i>
She's No Lady.
Detox and Alyssa.
First, you need to pick
your cast.
Detox.
- Roxxxy.
- Como?
[laughter]
- Alyssa.
- Jinkx.
- All right, Detox.
- You know I love you, Coco,
but I have to reform Rolaskatox.
- Por que?
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>
[laughter]
- Uh-oh, I don't want the judges
to see me relying
on the crutch of a clique.
- So that means, Coco,
you're with Alyssa.
- After all that drama with
Coco, Jinkx, and me,
we're all on the same team.
Go team Alyssa.
- Caballeros,
start your engines.
And may the best<i> mujer</i><span style="bodyStyle"> win.</i>
[all shouting<i> el grito]</i>
- This is the first time that
members of Rolaskatox are
working together
since I sort of decided that
we should all be free agents.
- [Italian accent]
We are now r-r-r-rich!
- You're so Italian.
- Muy r-r-r-rico.
[both laughing]
- That was perfect.
- It's terrible.
- Sometimes Detox's
sense of humor
gets in the way of
taking the things
that need to be taken seriously
serious.
- Michelle already warned you.
Cliques can be dangerous.
That reunion of Rolaskatox might
be broken up real fast.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
You cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful, Detox.
- Ah!
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God, that's sickening,
miss thing!
You have to use it.
- Today's main challenge is
serving up telenovela realness.
Oh, my God, I love it.
[trills]
- All:<i> Vaya con dios.</i>
- Telenovela is very loud
and in your face and dramatic.
-<i> Muerte.</i>
- And I am carrying his baby.
- [whispering indistinctly]
- Alyssa's not an actress,
but I guess like she said,
"I'll be bad in every challenge
and just get by
on the lip sync."
- I have the same disease!
I'm gonna be real drama there.
- You got to really, like,
bring it in,
'cause you rushing it like,
"I have the same disease!"
- I think Coco is definitely
trying to throw me off my game,
and I have to zone her out.
- Hola, hola, hola.
[overlapping greetings]
<i>Donde esta el drama?</i>
- All:<i> Aqui, aqui, aqui, aqui.</i>
- Hello, team Alyssa.
- La casa de locas.
- Yeah.
So what role are you playing,
Alyssa?
- I am playing a glamorous
woman of the house.
The ruler.
- Uh-huh.
- And Jinkx is my 18-year-old
virginal daughter.
So you cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?
- Yes.
- Coco, in the past,
you and Alyssa
have had your differences.
Have you guys worked through
that?
- No.
- Well, I'm just trying to gauge
how close you guys were
and how big this rift was.
- We were close.
- I'm thinking<i> The Turning Point</i>
with Anne Bancroft
and Shirley MacLaine.
- Let's do Tyra Banks
and Naomi Campbell.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, I'm Tyra Banks.
- Can I hear a little bit of it?
- Mamacita, mamacita,
Pablo asked me
to mar-r-r-ry him.
- Wait a minute,
is she Italian or is she--
- Oh, is it coming off Italian?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Have I been Italian
this whole time?
[laughter]
- If you hear the names of food,
you will violently orgasm.
Read my lines.
[laughs]
- You got a lot of lines
to memorize.
You know, we're down
to six girls now,
and the stakes are very high,
all right?
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
<i>Adios.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thanks, Ru.
- Adios.
- Team Detox.
Oh, my goodness.
- Hi, Ru.
- So you're playing
the young ingenue.
- Yes, I am the virginal
18-year-old.
I think we know
why I'm a virgin.
[laughter]
- Now, Detox, you reunited
Rolaskatox.
- Uh-huh.
- Is that a good idea?
Could it be a little bit of
a easy crutch?
- We just are so full
of personality,
and we have a lot of fun
working together.
- Well, you know,
it's great to have fun,
but you also need to take
this challenge seriously.
Now, Alaska, what are you
worried about in this challenge?
- If every line is over the top,
then it's like, the really,
like, zinger lines lose their--
- I have to take this off.
[laughter]
- Now, Detox,
on the main stage,
the criticism you get is that
we're getting "B" plus.
We want "A" plus from you.
And I'm just interested that
you're going to take it to that
place wearing a mask.
- Whatchu talkin' 'bout,
Willis?
- This is getting down
to the wire.
Somebody's gonna go home.
And you got to make sure
it's not you.
- Right.
- You got a lot of work to do.
Get at it.
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
In a moment, you'll head
to the telenovela set,
and tomorrow on the main stage,
the category is...
<i>Latina lamorosa extravaganza.</i>
- Ooh.
- Señoritas.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
Bye,<i> eses.</i>
- Her critique was about
this mask.
I don't feel it anymore.
- Girl, I've been read too many
times for wearing masks.
- Yeah.
- I've been working with
this mask the whole day.
- I always listen to critiques,
and she told us that
for a reason.
- I think that people are taking
this whole mask thing
a little bit too seriously.
- So we're good on costumes?
- Uh, pretty much.
- Do you think I should wear
this dress, Jinkx?
The gold one.
- Now she's just going through
my wardrobe.
- I don't know what's going on
with Alyssa.
She's over in Jinkx's wardrobe,
trying to find something to wear
for the challenge?
Good luck with that.
- Ow, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- I just stabbed myself.
Girl, all tea, all shade,
the dress doesn't fit.
- [sighs]
- You've got a ton of--
- Bull fantasy fat.
- Alyssa, for a pageant girl,
she sure didn't bring
no clothes.
I think it's time for her to go.
And I don't think I'm the only
one that feels that way.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Meet your handsome leading man.
- What?
- [screams]
- [moans]
- That's your orgasm, Alyssa?
- Have you ever had one?
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Team Detox.
<i>Hola, como esta?</i>
- Oh!
- My group is just about to
start shooting our telenovela,
and we're ready to blow it out
of the fucking park.
- Welcome to this lavish set,

- He is so gorgeous.
I want to have his babies.
- All right.
<i>Accion.</i>
- Diego.
<i>Que paso?</i>
- He is dead.
And now we must determine which
one of us killed him.
- I couldn't kill him.
Diego loved me.
And...
I gave him my virginity.
[all gasping]
And--
- Cut.
Try to keep the pace up.
<i>Accion.</i>
- Bring us the poison.
[glass clinking]
Our poison bit is going on
a long time.
Roxxxy and I are sort of
standing there like--
- Cut.
When you're serving it,
you don't really
have to be serving three
because we can't see that
you're going one, two, three.
- Okay.
- So to make it faster, just--
you know?
- Oh, okay, so--okay.
- Ladies, let's get into
your positions.
Now, Roxxxy, are you inching
over to Wilmer's crotch?
- Only my hand,
but you can't see it, right?
[laughter]
- Horn dog.
- Action.
- [gasps]
- [grunts]
- [gasps]
- Agh!
- Cut.
Could we tighten up
the slapping?
It looked a little,
you know--
- Both: [grunt]
- Agh!
- Cut.
Okay.
Ladies, you're fine.
- What?
- Thank you very much.
- Bye, Wilmer.
- Team Alyssa.
<i>Como esta?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Muy bien.
- Si.
- We're prepared,
and we are prepared
to take this set by storm
and really deliver the drama.
-<i> Accion.</i>
- [gasps]
- It is I who cast the spell.
- You are<i> muy estupida</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
if you think you are going to
take over our<i> familia.</i>
I am serving up
some Sofia "Vergar-r-a-rasa"
realness.
When I'm not talking,
I want to be reacting to what
other people are saying.
- Maria, I have some bad news.
If you hear the names of food,
you will orgasm so violently.
- Chimichanga.
- Ah, oh!
<i>Ay, ay, si, si!</i>
<i>Si, si!</i>
- Nacho grande!
- Ah!
- Ay, ay!
- Oh, oh!
[gasping]
- Cut.
When Jinkxy is doing the orgasm,
Alyssa, you need to at least
match
what Jinkx is doing.
- Okay.
- Ah, come on, Alyssa,
I really, really want you
to pull this off.
We are a team.
- And it's supposed to be
an orgasm, so, you know--
- Yeah.
I was trying to be like
a 48-year-old having it.
- Yeah, but you also want to
steal the scene, you know.
- Yeah, okay.
- Chimichanga.
- [moaning exaggeratedly]
- [whimpering]
- Whoever Alyssa is sleeping
with
is apparently
not doing their job.
- [sobbing]
No!
- And cut.
That's your orgasm, Alyssa?
- Have you ever had one?
- Yeah.
I'm feeling so insecure,
and it's frustrating
because I want to be so fierce
and so sickening,
and I'm not.
- Action.
- Have you seen Maria
or her mother?
- No esta aqui.
- Cut.
- No estan.
- No estan.
- Aqui.
- Aqui.
- Yes.
- No estan aqui.
They are--
Oh, my God.
Wilmer.
Ooh.
- Cut.
- I looked at him,
and I forgot my line.
- Would you like to have dinner
with me?
- [purrs]
I forgot my line, Ru.
- That's not gonna do anything
for us as a group.
I'm nervous because
I don't want my very best
to be overshadowed
by someone else's very worst.
- That's a wrap.
[energetic salsa music]
- Ooh.
- Get ready for the kraken.
- Get ready for the kraken,
darling.
- Coming into tonight's
elimination,
we're all on pins and needles,
because we do not know
what the edited,
finished product
is gonna look like.
Look, someone's gonna go home,
so I need to get my wigs ready.
- Alyssa, if you wear
one more do, bitch,
where you whip it off
to one side--
- Girl, if you wear one more
stretch costume, girl--
- [gasps]
- Go work on your outfits,
'cause I think
you're running out.
- Ooh!
- It's done.
- Wait, wait, wait, Alyssa,
do you have enough stuff
to get through
the rest of the competition?
- Girl, yes, ma'am.
And I can sew if I have to sew.
- Alyssa, you ain't gonna
have to sew
'cause you'll be goin' in
everybody else's wardrobe.
- Oh!
- Ah!
- Hold on now,
let's get something clear.
That was for the challenge.
Baby, I ain't never wore none
of y'all's stuff on the runway.
I ain't never had to,
and I never will.
- Girl, if you had as much
energy in your orgasm yesterday
as you got right now,
we would have been fine.
- Ooh!
- Coco thinks she's smart.
I think it's a part of Coco's
character to take low blows.
When all the pageant stuff
went down,
she did the same thing.
- Are you scared going into
this runway?
- I feel confident
with my look today
because it's a clear concept
from head to toe.
I'm gonna do<i> Dia de los Muertos.</i>
I'm gonna do skeleton makeup.
- Jinkx Monsoon,
the buffoon.
What are you thinking, girl?
You're going out there
as Skeletor?
One judge did say,
I think it was Michelle,
that you're kind of costume-y.
- I really want to wear
this costume.
- But it's a risk.
- If it doesn't land,
it's like me telling jokes.
Then it was,
it was a complete miss.
- Are you single right now?
- I started trying to, like,
kind of date a little bit.
- Yeah.
- Afterwards, um--
Opening up about my ex-boyfriend
is still really difficult.
Our relationship
was so tumultuous,
especially towards the end.
When I ended up trying
to break up with him,
he got really crazy
and started stalking me,
and was, like,
threatening my life
and, like, telling me...
- What?
- He was gonna find me.
Then, two weeks later,
he was dead, so--
You know, I saw the body.
I got to the house,
and there he was.

I've never really talked

the way that I feel.

your makeup looks amazing.
More so than ever before.
- This is the least amount
of makeup I've worn ever.
- [laughs]
- You look stunning.
- Thank you so much.
- And the telenovela,
from the way you moved your body
to your high-pitched voice,
the way you moved your head
when you got slapped.
You took that role, and you did
great things with it,
and I was really impressed.
- Up next, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Tonight on the runway,
you gave us another upbeat walk,
and it works for you.
- Cruella de Vil.
That's what I saw
when you were acting,
which you did a very good job.
- I think you're really,
really gifted.
I could take notes from you,
for sure.
- Thank you.
- Up next, Alyssa Edwards.

It is such a mess.
I don't get it.
I don't get what
it's supposed to be.
- Okay, when you go
to the clubs,

each and every night,
you don't ask the girls,
"Did you sew that?
"Did you make that?
Were you funny the other night
to get here?"
But if you say tonight,
lip sync for your life,
I'm gonna lip sync for my life,
and if I'm able to stay,
I'll do it every damn week
because I am an entertainer.
- Alyssa, every last one of
these girls
are amazing performers.
- I didn't discredit nobody.
- It comes across as if,
"I'm the best entertainer
up here,
"and if I have to lip sync
for my life every night,
I'll lip sync my way
all the way to the crown."
That's not what this is about.

how to connect the pieces.

- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right,
just between us<i> chicas,</i>
what do you think?
Let's start with Detox.
- Tonight on the runway,
this really wasn't Detox's
best effort.
And I expect more from her.
- Well, she slapped very good.
[laughs]
- Which is very important
in a telenovela.
- Yes.
- She was funny-ish
with baby<i> dos</i>
but could have been
so much bigger.
Like, that was
a wasted opportunity.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- She looked so pretty
with that black hair,
and her makeup looked gorgeous.
And her body shape
with the cinch waist.
She just melted my loins.
- Well, I loved seeing her
cinched in like that.
And the hair, and she drew on
the Latin curls.
- Oh, on the face.
That's so cute.
Yeah.
And in the telenovela.
- She was strong.
Everything she did,
the physicality,
her voice, the pitch.
She stood out.
- Roxxxy redeemed herself
this week
from the past two weeks
of kind of letting us down.
- Alaska.
- Ella No Es Dama really was
the better of the two
telenovelas because of Alaska.
- It was a very layered
performance.
She's a gifted comedian.
- Tonight on the runway,
the dress looked really cheap.
But she gave us
a little more ass.
- Yes.
- And you like that.
- Hell, yeah, I like more ass.
[laughter]
- Alyssa Edwards.
What did you think of her outfit
on the runway?
- Whoever made that for her
is fired.
- Thanks a lot, Grandma.
- [laughing]
- And what'd you think of her
in the telenovela?
- That role could have been
so, so big and funny,
because she's so intriguing
to me.
- How is it that
she doesn't know
how to ham it up
in front of a camera?
- She doesn't know
what she's got.
- She was already talking about,
like,
having to lip sync for her life
tonight.
- If that inner dialogue
is saying,
you know,
"I'm gonna fail at this
or I'm not any good at this,"
well, hello,
that's what you get, you know.
- Yes.
- Jinkxy Monsoon.
- She is a very good actress.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
- She took that script,
and she made it her own.
- That takes a really talented
person to be able to do that.
- She looked flawless
in that telenovela.
- Yeah.
- The<i> Dia de los Muertos.</i>
It was shocking.
I think she looked fierce
the way she did it.
- I loved the<i> cojones</i>
it took to do that,
and it really did
catch me by surprise.
Coco Montrese.
- I thought she looked gorgeous.
I mean, this is her color,
the shape,
even the cheapish flowers.
In the novela, there were a lot
of weird choices
and missed opportunities.
A lot of literal acting out,
which is, like, cardinal sin
number one.
- I wanted her to stand out
so much more.
It felt as if her role
was insignificant
until the end
when you realized what it was,
and then you just wished
that it was more than that.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews,

- Wow.
Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Coco Montrese...
shantay, you stay.
- [exhales heavily]
Coco, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- [inaudible]
- [sighs]
- Alyssa Edwards,
the next time you look
in the mirror,
I hope you see what I see--
a triple threat.
A dancer,
a beauty queen,
and one fierce-ass
"entertainter".
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
[applause]
Deuces.
I cannot say
that I'm heartbroken,
because I gave it my all.
And to say that
I am in the top six
of America's finest
in this art form
is a privilege,
and it's an honor.
Always and forever...
[echoing]
Alyssa Edwards!
- Condragulations,
my ferocious five.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- All: Amen.
- Let the music play.

- Ru, you're acting to me, um--
[clears throat]
- What do you call it
when you flatline?
- Fuck.
- I'm not acting when I say
I'm insecure about things.
- It's all bullshit.
- Girl, you look like

[laughter]
- RuPaul's next...
[microphone feedback]
Drag queen of the year--
[microphone feedback]
- Coco Montrese,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Condragulations.
- [cries]
- What's going on?
- My mother
left my sister and myself
at a bus stop when I was three.
It just hurt that I was left.
- As gay people,
we get to choose our family.
We are family here.
What you two did on this runway
is the passion I am looking for.
Shante, you both stay.
- Oh, my god, my god, my god.
My god.
- Oh. Are we all a mess?
- So we're walking
back into the workroom,
and I just finished
having the breakdown of my life.
I know y'all don't understand
what I was saying
'cause I was crying so much,
but it all just hit me.
I have never cried
about being left by my mom.
- Ever?
- Ever!
I was left at a bus stop
by my real mother,
and I was sent to an orphanage.
I've always felt rejection.
Part of me comes off
as such a strong character.
You know, like
when y'all were reading me,
you and Jade and stuff like--
that comes from being rejected.
The way I tend
to react to rejection
is getting very angry.
I was angry, and the easiest
target was Jinkx.
I totally took it out on her.
And that's not fair.
And Jinkx, I'm sorry.
- After seeing what Roxxxy
went through tonight,
I can't stay mad at her,
you know.
We have all been through so much
shit in our lives.
- Roxxxy Andrews is my sister,
and I'm so happy
that she's still here.
But it's still top seven
and not top six.
And I know I'm annoyed.
And I think a lot
of other girls are annoyed.
- This has been rough
fucking day.
I still am the one queen
who hasn't won a challenge.
- I can't believe I got it
with you two in the room.
What the hell?
The two comedy queens of
oh, my god.
I won?
What happened
to the funny girls?
Jinkx, Alaska.
- I just really
want to win a challenge.
- This was a challenge
right up your alley.
Do you feel, like, Coco,
you know--
- These other queens don't think
that I'm a force
to be reckoned with.
Good.
It's called a sneak attack.
I'ma get you, girl.

Hey, ladies.
Can you smell me?
Mm.
It's the sweet

Good luck.
And don't funk it up.
- What?
- Smell?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- Now at this point in the race,

- I bet you are.
Now, ladies,
Andrew has brought his models
to play a little game
of whatcha packin'?
-<i> You know</i>

- [laughs]
- You ask a model to drop trou
and reveal
his Andrew Christians.
- Oh!
- Your job is
to find the matching pair.

Now, the queen that makes all
the matches the fastest wins.
- Oh, my god.
- First up, Ivy Winters.
- [laughs]
- The rest of you,
wait outside for your turn.
All right, Ivy, choose a model.
- Number 9.
[laughs]
- Oh.
- 14, please.
[buzzer]
- Not a match.
Next pick.
- Number 10.
- Damn.
You're gonna put somebody's
eyes out with that thing.
- 18.
[ding]
- We got a match.
How did we end up
in the meatpacking district?
- [laughs]
- Number 6.
both: Red.
- Now wait a minute.
- Wait. Oh, no.
I forgot what one was red.
- [laughs]
- I'm so distracted.
[laughs]
I am trying to memorize what boy
has got what underwear on.
And at the same time,
I'm just thinking,
god, this guy's really hot.
- Pick a model.
- 22.
- Ooh, pretty in pink.
- Oh, my god.
[shrieks]
I could play this game all day.
- It's like the Rockettes
only a lot more cock.
- 6.

Oh, wait.
Son of a bitch.
- Oh, damn it.
- Take them the fuck off.
I've had it.
- [laughs]
- Number 6 and number 7.
[buzzer]
- Ooh, not a match.
Alyssa, you're not doing
very well here.
- No, I'm doing very well.
I'm just not making any matches.
- Exactly, exactly.
- 15 and 7.
[ding]
- We got a match.
I don't know why
but I'm craving a corn dog.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
every straight woman
and gay man in America.
[laughter]
But one of you de-pants
these boys in record time.
The winner is...
Ivy Winters!
- [laughs]
Yay.
[laughs]
- You've won a phone call home.
- [gasps]
- Oh.
- I'm so happy I won
the mini challenge.
I'll be able to call my mom.
- Ladies, you know
you've reached the height
of superstardom when you have
your own fragrance.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be creating and marketing
your own signature fragrance.
- [gasps]
- You'll come up with the scent,
a name, a package, and then
film your own commercial.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...
[magical tone]
Win.
- Damn it, I wanted that.
You cunt.
- I'm so excited.
We've been doing
comedy after comedy.
A perfume ad
is something that me,
a pageant girl,
would like to do.
[bottles clatter]
- [gasps]
- Shit.
- How many did she--
drops did she say goes in?
- It depends on how you make it.
- Alyssa doesn't even
notice that
she's knocked a whole
bottle of oil all over me.
Yeah, I got to start over again.
Alyssa just doesn't think
past her own wig.
You know, it's all about Alyssa.
And it's pissing me off.
- My fragrance
is called Ruanimale.
- Does it smell like me
or does it smell like you?
- It smells like food
and maple and--
- Yeah, it smells like IHOP.
[laughs]
- [laughs]
- For the main challenge,
we have to create a scent...
- Ugh.
[coughs]
- Design a slogan,
the perfume bottle,
and shoot a commercial.
- Does everyone have an idea
of where you want to go?
- Kind of.
I think I've got like
a general idea.
- And what are you
gonna call it?
- Ivy winter's Poison Rosebud.
- [laughs]
That's cute.
- I've always been interested
in making my own perfume.
I've thought about
going to school for it.
I think I'm creative enough
to come up with
a really delicious perfume.
- Oh, it's so good,
I just want to
spray it all over my body
right now.
- [laughs]
- I haven't won a challenge yet,
so it's do or die.
I'm taking my gut reaction
and just running
straight forward with it.
Did somebody get fresh dirt?
I'm using things like dirt,
leather--
earthy and dirty,
which is totally my brand.
Oh, my god.
I love it.
- Mm, what you got going on?
- It's gonna start
like it's the morning after.
- Yeah.
- And have the pit crew
and me, like,
laying on a sofa or something
as if we had a threesome.
- That's a cute idea.
- I've been told continuously
in this competition,
"Girl, I don't get you."
But there's one person
who always gets who I am
and what I'm doing.
And it's Ivy.
- What about you?
- I'm doing a poison rosebud.
[both laugh]
- You know, a rosebud
is a synonym for asshole.
- I know,
that's why I'm using it.
- Just checking.
- Jinkx is amazing.
I feel like
I can relate to her a lot,
and the other girls
are totally threatened,
so that's why they're
all kind of nitpicking at her.
- Any help from me at all,
just let me know.
- Okay, honey.
I got to get back
to my rosebuds.
- Go prune the roses.
- [laughs]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are my little stinkers
doing?
[laughter]
- Alaska.
- Hi.
- Is your fragrance gonna
represent Alaska?
- It is.
It smells delicious,
but it's also a little weird.
- Huh.
- Do you want to smell it?
- Yeah, I would love
to smell it.
It's not gonna make me sick,
is it?
- Well, I hope not.
You're the first guinea pig,
so--
- [inhales deeply]
[groaning]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah,
yeah.
- My fragrance is called Red.
- Has Red been used before?
- Oh.
I think he's right.
Which means
I have to make up a tagline.
- All right, Alaska.
Good luck, and I can't wait
to smell you.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
Look at that bottle.
- Hi, Ru.
- What's the name
of your fragrance?
- My name of my fragrance
is Thick &amp; Juicy.
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's all about confidence.
And you have to embrace
and love yourself.
And like I told you guys,
I've embraced myself
with how I look,
and I want to
share that with everybody.
And wearing this is gonna
help you get confidence.
- Can I smell it?
- The smell is delicious.
It smells like food and maple
and jasmine at the same time.
- Oh, my goodness, yes.
It smells like IHOP.
Ooh, your country breakfast
is ready.
Y'all hungry?
Listen, you have
a lot of work to do here
'cause you know,
you were in the bottom two
last week,
so this has really
got to pop for you.
I'll see you then.
- Okay.
- All right.
Hey, Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tell me about your fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Ruanimale by Coco.
- Ooh.
Does it smell like me
or does it smell like you?
- It smells like me.
- Do you think the title
is a little confusing
for the consumer?
- No, because it says
Ruanimale by Coco.
- Ru is a little concerned
about the name.
But every perfume line
has a spokesperson.
- Okay, all right.
I'll have to check
with my lawyer.
I can't wait
to see the campaign.
See ya.
Alyssa Edwards.
- Hello, Ru.
- This sounds like a challenge
right up your alley.
- Something like that.
[laughs]
- Okay, tell me about your
fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Alyssa's Secret.
- What is Alyssa's Secret?
- Um--
Son of a bitch.
Well, my secret to what?
- Here's Alyssa's secret,
darling.
The secret is, she don't know
what the fuck she's doing.
Here's the secret.
You can't tell Alyssa anything.
Here's a secret.
You can't get Alyssa
in front of a mirror
without taking four hours.
I've had it.
- I would have to really think
what my secret is,
because I wanted the secret
to be left for the imagination.
Ru is definitely not buying
what I'm trying to sell,
so this concerns me.
- Clarify your message, okay?
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi.
- Tell me about your fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Ivy Winters' Poisoned Rosebud.
- Wow, that's a mouthful.
What are you
patterning it after?
- I really wanted to be able
to give women confidence,
to be classy, to be powerful.
- Well, that sounds like
a lot of fragrances.
- That is a lot of fragrances,
yeah.
- As this performer, you have
to be a marketing person too.
And actually break it down,
like, who is Ivy Winters?
And you think, okay.
You put together outfits.
You think, the circus performer.
You think of wacky, young.
But what I'm hearing is,
you're designing this
for a woman 45 and older.
- I completely missed the mark
with this rosebud.
Talking to you, I realize that
this is not really me.
Oh, what am I doing, Ivy?
I gotta get it together.
I'm just, like, thinking,
like, crazy.
I gotta make it happen.
Make it work.
- All right, listen up, ladies.
In a moment, you'll be shooting
your perfume commercials.
You'll be directed
by Michelle Visage
and our extra special
guest judge,
the enterprising singer
Aubrey O'Day.
- [gasps]
Yay.
- What?
- And this week
on the main stage,
come dressed
for your fragrance launch,
where we'll be joined by
one of my absolute favorites,
Joan Van Ark.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ladies,

You guys are asleep

Does this look like we had sex?
- Looks like something.
Action.

- Her legs are really open
for selling perfume.
- Cut.
Remember it's perfume,
not a dildo ad.
So you might want to
take it down just a notch.
- Okay.
- Action.
- Nothing about her
felt like a lady.
Her legs were spread open,
her arms were awkward.
It felt kind of messy.
You look like this.
- Show me, show me, Aubrey.
- Hold on, let me just do
a couple--a little bit longer.
[laughter]
Something like this.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hello.
- Can we see your background

- And action.
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.

that changes your style.
- Cut.
- Remember it's scent,
not smell.
- Not only does it--
not only--excuse me.
Aubrey O'Day, her eyes are
a little intimidating.
- Feel it, girl.
- Ivy Winters, Dress Code.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
- What's the name

- Ruanimale by Coco.
- Blue animale?
- Ru.
- Boo?
- Ru.
- Ruanimale?
- Ruanimale.
Yes.
- And you're wearing leopard
and you're performing
in front of leopard.
- Yeah.
- Coco--damn,
she gave me a headache.
There was so much leopard
happening.
The outfit, the hair--
it felt like a bad, cheesy porn.
- Ruanimale by Coco.
The wild exotic essence
of a woman.
[lion snarls]
- Cut.
- You have so much going on,
especially with your background.
So I would try your hardest
to keep your face
as soft as you can.
- Because everything else
is gonna be so animale.
- Yeah.
- Action.
[lion snarling]
- I feel like I'm watching
<i>The Lion King</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now.</i>
- [laughs]
[elephant trumpets]
- I just don't know how well
she's gonna be able to recover
from all that leopard.
- It's Detox.
- Hi.
- First of all, what's the name
of your scent?
- Heroine.
- Hmm.
- It's kind of a double entendre
of the drug heroin
because my name is Detox
and a heroine,
which is a really strong
female figure.
And I feel like I embody
all of that.
- And action.
- Detox.
[whispers]
Sexy.
[deep voice]
Heroine.
[whispers]
Seductive.
[deep voice]
Heroine.
[whispers]
Get high.
[inhales]
Ah.
- [giggles]
- And cut.
- I don't think whispering
always means sexy.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's trying too hard.
Just mean the word.
- Okay.
- Detox is beautiful,
tall, great hair,
but I don't really
remember the commercial at all.
- Alyssa Edwards.
Action.
- Every woman has a secret.
Mine happens to be
a little bigger.
- Wha--what did you say?
- [laughs]
Oh, girl.
My secret--
[laughs]
I'm a man.
[laughs]
A scent sophisticated
for the everyday woman,
yet strong enough
for the career lady.
- And cut.
- You're real hard right now.
Make me like you.
Right now I'm like, ugh.
She's real pretty,
but her personality is crazy.
- Every woman has a secret.
Um...
uh, what was my next line?
Oh, let me start again.
Sorry.
I just feel so damn tense.
- You look it.
- I can talk to people
all day long,
but the minute someone says,
"Here are the lines,
say it," game over.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Hi.
- So, what's the name
of your scent?
- My scent, just like me,
is Thick &amp; Juicy.
- Action.
- Thick &amp; Juicy,
for the girls that are a little
thick and juicy.
And it smells just like food.
- Cut.
- Okay, we're gonna
do that again.
- [inhales]
Mmm. And tastes
just like my favorite foods.
Maple, chocolate,
and a little bit of everything.
- Cut.
- And smells
just like maple syrup,
chocolate, and watermelon.
- Cut.
I feel like you're making up
your words.
What did you plan to say, Rox?
- I planned to say that
it smells so good
you can eat it,
but then I was, like, "Hold on.
Perfume, you can't eat it."
- Okay.
So, you ended up with,
"I don't know"?
All right.
- Hi, Alaska.
Tell us the name of your scent.
- Red for filth.
- Oh, work!
- Okay, do you have any modeling
or scene work or anything?
- For dangerous, flawless,
seductive, and overpriced.
She's gonna be,
like, turning around and,
like, catching the camera.
And then it cross-fades.
And then turn around.
- Girl.
- Let's do this.
All right.
- Seductive.
Overpriced.
Those all look kind of the same.
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe you should just do it
one right after the other
like Wonder Woman.
Just keep spinning.
- Okay.
- And don't stop.
Dangerous.
Spin!
Seductive!
Overpriced!
[laughter]
- I love Red to filth.
She knew exactly
what she wanted to do,
and she took control.
And at the end of the day,
that's more impressive
than any win you can get.
- I think we've got it.
- Okay.
- That's a wrap, Ms. Alaska.
- Thank you, guys.
- Good job.
- Can I open up to you about
something?
- Mm-hmm.
- I have a crush on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- I love you.
[crying]
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
[overlapping chatter]
- Here we are, again.
Today is elimination day.
And like usual,
I'm scrambling around
and trying to get a really good
runway look together.
I'm going through my suitcases,
and I completely forgot that
I packed this photo book.
I have to show you guys
something.
This is my friend Caldwell's
photo book
chronicling the House of Haute.
- Oh, how much fun is that.
- Oh, my gosh, how neat.
Are you really onstage naked?
- Girl, we do some shit, girl.
With all of, like,
my family and my friends.
That's in the airport
the day Sharon came back
from<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Getting to, like, see this book
that I totally forgot
that I had,
was like a huge,
like, shot in the arm.
[crying]
It was just so, like,
encouraging.
And it just makes me feel
renewed completely.
- I won the mini challenge,
and my prize
is getting to call to my mom.
Hi.
I'm so happy.
[laughs]
- I'm just so happy
to see your face.
[laughter]
- Seeing all the girls having
such tragic stories
with their families,
it made me really start thinking
about how special
you guys are to me.
- Aww.
- And I'm so blessed
to have such an amazing family.
- Yeah.
[laughing, crying]
When I was little,
I did a lot of theater,
and I was always nervous.
And she'd always,
like, squeeze my hand,
just to let me know
that everything
was gonna be all right.
And you know, she's proud of me.
Hmm.
I love you.
- Bye-bye.
- Mwah.
- Can I open up to you
about something?
- Mm-hmm.
- I have a crush on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- I definitely can sense
those kind of feelings
bubbling up.
My biggest fear
is that this is gonna be done,
and she's gonna go back
to New York.
And I'm gonna
go back to Seattle,
and I'm gonna be like, "mm."
[snorts]
- You little scamp, you.
- I don't want to lose my head
or anything.
- Well, you know, that's cute.
- I don't know
how to describe it in words
how much Ivy means to me.
I almost think
that this could be
the beginning
of a relationship.
I'm really excited about that.
- Ivy.
- How was it, Ivy?
- It was so special.

And tonight,
they're ready to mark the runway
with the scent of a drag queen.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[upbeat music]
- First up, Coco Montrese.
Panther on the runway.
- Zebra on the runway.
- Okay.
- I'm serving animalistic
evening gown down.
I feel exquisite.
- I almost wore that outfit.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Alaska.
Lady in red.
A head for business
and a body for sin.
- Yes.
- I'm giving
crazy red executive dreams.
If this look
isn't changing it up,
I'm not really sure what is.
- I own 51% of this company.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- The flounce and the bounce.
- I'm trying to move
as much as possible,
so every little
sparkly rhinestone
just twinkles in their eye.
[laughs]
- She's a Ziegfeld girl.
- Is she getting too old
for that whorey look?
[laughter]
- You're never too old for that.
- No.
- Detox.
- Ooh.
- High fa-shi-on.
- Oh, yeah.
- I see London, I see France.
- You can't fucking
take this body.
You have no choice but to get up
into my cakes and my lingerie
and love every little bit of it.
- Between love and madness
lies Detox.
- [laughs]
- Then of course, rehab.
- Alyssa Edwards.
<i>Dallas</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meets</i><i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meets</i>
<i>Knots Landing.</i>
I am giving 2013 businesswoman,
and I am living
for my gig today.
- Ah, the smell of it.
- Ah, yes.
- Does this skirt
make my damask look big?
- Mm.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
She works for MGM by day
and FOX all night.
- I am floating
down that runway,
and I am just
being cute and lovely.
- Oh.
- And 100% Jinkxy.
- No animals were harmed.
- No animals were harmed, yes.
Roxxxy Andrews, cat suit.
I could read her lips.
- [laughs]
- I turn this corner,
and they're gonna get a load
of this back.
Ow, eat it, bitch.
- Roxxxy Andrews,
the other white meat.
- She can bring home the bacon,
fry it up in a pan,
and serve it.
- There wasn't much going on,
idea-wise.
- I don't even know what you're
selling me,
but I don't want this.
- The perfume smells like
grandma's vag.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Welcome, ladies.
Coco Montrese, let's see your
fragrance commercial.
- Ruanimale by Coco.
Wild.
[lion snarls]
Exotic.
Essence of a woman.
- Ooh!
- As far as the video goes,
too much leopard,
and the guy with the headpiece
makes it gimmicky.
- Tonight, probably
one too many accessories,
but I think
this dress is gorgeous.
- Next up, Alaska.
- Dangerous, flawless,
overpriced.
Whether you're getting
read the house down...
- Your makeup is terrible.
- [laughs]
- Or just ready to go down.
The exciting new fragrance.
Red for filth.
Are you red..."e" for me?
[laughter]
- Absolutely loved it.
The only thing,
when you went south,
I wanted to see a big fat smile
on his face.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.
For the glamorous girl
on the go.
Not only does it smell good,
but it changes your style.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Dress code by Ivy Winters.
The scent that
changes your style.
- Oh, dear.
- There wasn't much going on,
idea-wise.
- There were a lot of
awkward moments,
and as far as
the outfit tonight,
it's ice skater-y.
You're all about a dress code.
- Detox.
- Seduction, addiction,
heroine.
- [laughs]
- Sexy, sultry.
Heroine.
- [laughs]
- The new addiction
for an addictive woman.
Available at the clinic.
[laughter]
- The commercial was so brave
and so out there.
And the voiceover part.
Bravo to you.
- Tonight, something
looks a little unfinished.
It's not quite pushing it
as far as you normally do.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- Every woman has a secret.
And my secret happens to be
a little bigger.
And what exactly is my secret?
[laughs]
Why, it's Alyssa's secret.
For the desired
and the inspired.
- I don't even know
what you're selling me,
but I don't want this.
I want to change the channel.
- You do this thing
with your eyes
and it's like this sexy,
like, open 'em
and then close 'em.
I've gotten this note
a million times
which is why I'm just
passing it your way.
Less is more
'cause it almost gets
a little serial killer-ish.
[laughter]
- Jinkx, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.
[laughs]
I'm just saying, "Water
off a duck's back" to myself.
Um, before my critiques.
- That's a great mantra.
- Words can't hurt you.
Only your own perception
of those words.
- Let's see your
fragrance commercial.
- For the girl
who lives above her means.
For the girl
who just won't give up.
For the girl with a dream.
Delusion.
[laughs]
Convince yourself.
- [laughs]
- I thought
it was the best concept.
No tea, no shade, hunty,
but I think it's my favorite.
- I'll have what she's having.
- [laughs]
- I don't even have enough words
for how happy I am tonight
with your look.
- Thank you.
- All right, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Thick &amp; Juicy.
For the girls who are like me.
Thick &amp; Juicy.
For the girls that like to eat
and don't worry
about being petite.
[inhales]
Mmm.
- Tonight on the runway,
I'm not in love
with that bow placement
right in the front.
When you turn to the side,
it's really kind of
sticking out.
- Roxxxy is another one
who came in with not much
of a concept.
You didn't have anything
written down.
You were just kind of
winging it,
which made it different
kind of each time.
- I know it kind of
seemed confusing to you
when I kept switching my words.
- It wasn't confusing.
It was unprofessional.
- Oh.
- I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Just between us girls,
what do you stink?
We're gonna start
with Alyssa's secret.
Ooh.
- Right?
- It smells like
a Kardashian sex tape.
- If you ask her,
"What's your secret?"
And she's, "Well, I don't know.
I don't know."
She's not delivering her brand
and, therefore, her secret.
- Coco Montrese.
- Ruanimale is by far the worst.
- It smells like mating time
at the zoo.
- Not only is it
kissing your ass,
which I normally
don't have a problem with--
- [laughs]
- But they were supposed to be
expressing themselves
in their fragrance.
- Right.
I think her campaign,
and her in general,
is obvious, unoriginal,
and overdone.
- Ooh, okay.
- Ooh.
- Let's go next to Alaska.
- I enjoyed the commercial,
and I loved her outfit
on the runway
carrying the red theme through.
- I love the perfume.
Hers is the only one
that I would wear.
Everything else
smells like grandma's vag to me.
- [laughs]
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.
- I think she missed everything
completely.
- I'm just clocking that bottle.
It does look like
a Christmas ornament.
And I think
it smells like something
my housekeeper used yesterday
in the bathroom.
- Or did in the bathroom.
- Oh, my goodness!
All right.
Heroine by Detox.
Joan Van Ark,
what'd you think of Detox?
And not your own
personal experiences--
- [laughs]
With it?
I don't share that with you?
Her Detox commercial I loved
because it was very brave
and upfront
and right out there.
- This week,
I wasn't feeling her look.
It looked a little homemade.
- Jinkx Monsoon's Delusion.
- She looked so beautiful
tonight.
I was so very proud of her.
- She had one of the best
commercials,
but it felt very, like,
vaudeville-y.
- All right, let's move on
to Roxxxy Andrews'
Thick &amp; Juicy.
- On the runway,
I wasn't in love with her look.
She had a bit of an open back,
but it wasn't cut out
nearly enough
to save the front of that look.
- The whole thing was tacky.
The outfit tonight was tacky.
The commercial was tacky.
I-I can't.
- [laughs]
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
Detox.
You're safe.
Alaska, this week, girl,
you caused quite a stink.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ha ha!
- You've won a selection
of handcrafted corsets
from corsetconnection.com.
- [laughs]
I'm so happy.
I can't say this win is overdue,
but it's right on fucking time.
- Ivy Winters.
In your commercial,
your dress code
was not strictly enforced.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I did not expect
to be lip-synching.
I can't believe
this is actually happening.
- Coco Montrese.
Safari, so goody.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Alyssa Edwards, this week
you were not as inspired
as we desired.
Roxxxy Andrews,
your Thick &amp; Juicy
was a bit too loosey-goosey.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Alyssa, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I'm disappointed, of course.
I don't want to be known
as being in the bottom
two times in a row.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
- I have a lot to prove.
A lot is riding
on this performance.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

Ivy, I'm going to miss

Ivy Winters!
I love you, Ivy.
- I love you too.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you, guys, so much.
- Oh.
I'm so sad to see Ivy go.
For a while now, I feel like
she's one of the only people
who have tried
to fully understand me.
- I made amazing friends
along the way.
I'm--I'm very happy with what
I've put out to the world.
I'll miss Jinkx the most,
but we'll be
seeing each other soon.
That, I'm not worried about.
It's just so sad.
[laughs]
I'm crying because they're all
gonna miss me so damn much.
[laughs]
- My sickening six, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Now, let the music play.

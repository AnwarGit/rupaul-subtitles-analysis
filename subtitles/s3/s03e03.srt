00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,667
- Ooh!

181
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,533
- They all fools, 'cause I have
an acting company.

182
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,367
So their loss
if they don't pick me.

183
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:22,567
- India.

184
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,934
- Shangela.

185
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,066
- Manila.

186
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,867
- High-five, team.

187
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,133
- Stacy.

188
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:31,333
Of course had to get with
big girl Miss Stacy, honey.

189
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:36,200
- Phoenix, two are left,
Carmen and Mimi.

190
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,233
Who are you choosing?

191
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,667
- Carmen.

192
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,133
- Carmen's coming on over,

193
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:46,066
which of course means that Mimi
is going to Mariah's side.

194
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,233
- By not picking me, the other
team is gonna be sorry.

195
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,967
[people cheering]

196
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,100
- I'm on Phoenix's team,
and I feel amazing.

197
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,767
I feel like that's,
like, the dream team.

198
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,066
We have, like, the most talent.

199
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,567
I'm looking across the room,
and I'm like, "Ugh.

200
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,867
A bunch of boogers."

201
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,767
- In these two envelopes, I have
two scripts,

202
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:08,700
<i>Drag Queens in Outer Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

203
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,333
and the sequel,<i> </i>
<i>Return to Uranus.</i>

204
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,800
- Thank you.

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
- Now, your sci-fi movie
trailers

206
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,333
will make their world debut
on the main stage tomorrow.

207
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,934
Gentlemen, start your engines.

208
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:29,300
And may the best woman win.

209
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,233
[cheers and applause]

210
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,800
- All right.

211
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,166
Let's go scandalous.

212
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,734
I want to be Boobarella.

213
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,600
Hermaphrodite, which is this
genderfuck evil queen,

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,300
mannish and womanly
at the same time,

215
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,533
and is absolutely jealous
of Boobarella's beauty.

216
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:50,467
- The villainess,
Hermaphrodite, is Mimi.

217
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,834
Fitting.

218
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,867
You better get your Oscar,
bitch.

219
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,433
- I'm gonna give you
Meryl Streep realness.

220
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,166
You got to get ugly
to win the prize.

221
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,633
- And, Tweaker,
this is perfect for you,

222
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:01,767
an alien space monkey.

223
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,200
The twinbots,
sexy robot twins.

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,500
Okay.

225
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,767
- Yes.

226
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,133
- I didn't want to pair up
with Shangela.

227
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,700
I mean, I haven't seen
no improvement.

228
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,834
She said she had worked
the whole entire year.

229
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:15,367
Where?

230
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,934
- We're filming
our sci-fi trailer today,

231
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:28,066
and we have to learn lines.

232
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,600
We got to make costumes.

233
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,734
- Yay, we have a great cast.

234
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,934
- Our cast is great, yes.

235
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,100
- We're gonna really win this.

236
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,367
- All right,
let's go over our lines.

237
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,300
- I feel like...

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,266
- Everybody, okay.

239
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,633
Let's start--start just going
over this.

240
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,433
- [clears throat]

241
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:49,800
- Phoenix's leadership skills
are a little questionable.

242
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,133
- All right, y'all ready?

243
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,166
- If you go to Mexico.

244
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,066
- It's actually a lot to
memorize.

245
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:58,567
- I think she was afraid and
really didn't assert herself.

246
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,467
Let's do our table reading.
- Okay.

247
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,266
- Bimborella,
looking for these?

248
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,066
- [high-pitched babbling]

249
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,500
- That's right, Tweaker.

250
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,600
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,834
Prepare to tranny-port aboard.

252
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,567
- Twinbots, stay
on the lookout.

253
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,834
both: We are on the lookout.

254
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,834
- Y'all need to, like, come up
with a voice.

255
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't want you to just use
your normal voice.

256
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,533
You're, like, robots.

257
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,700
- Rosie the robot, she wasn't
really that robot-y.

258
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,734
Her voice was kind of normal,
and...

259
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,333
- Yeah, we can be like,
"Oh, wait a minute."

260
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,100
- And in unison together.

261
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,166
- Yeah.

262
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,667
- Maybe I should have been
team leader.

263
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,467
- Lady Tata's been kidnapped?

264
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,333
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.

265
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,800
- The ship is surrounded
by a force field...

266
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
[laughs]

267
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,133
- We're trying to rehearsal,
and Mimi's being loud.

268
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,333
She's acting like
we're not there.

269
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,333
- I am...your father.

270
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,567
And your mother!

271
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,100
- Back off, Hermaphrodite.

272
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,700
- Your weapons are no good
here.

273
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,734
- That's not the line, baby.

274
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,100
"Your weapons won't work here."

275
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,200
- "Your weapons won't work
here."

276
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,266
- Read it.
- I got it, girl.

277
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,400
You get the punctuation
in your line.

278
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,734
I'll get my lines, all right?

279
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,300
- But just read the script.
You're doing your thing.

280
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,200
No tea.
Just read the scripts.

281
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,567
- Let's refocus.
Let's refocus.

282
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,500
- Mimi already is trying to show

283
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,233
that she is the star
of this group,

284
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,667
that she's standing out.

285
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,667
Miss Mimi, we know
you're talented, honey.

286
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,233
We know you have
the theater background.

287
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:27,667
Can we get through
one read-through, please?

288
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,834
- Hello, hello, hello.

289
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,667
all: Hey, Ru!

290
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:37,233
- Now, I'm just checking in
on my budding starlets.

291
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,667
all: Hey, Ru.

292
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,900
- Let's start with Team Phoenix,
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>

293
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,066
- That's right.

294
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,166
- Now who's playing what role?

295
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,066
- We've got Delta playing
Boobarella.

296
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,300
- Okay.
Pleasure to meet you.

297
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,700
Phoenix, I'm surprised

298
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,100
you didn't take the lead,
Boobarella, for yourself.

299
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,867
- I think she will make
an amazing Boobarella.

300
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,066
She's got this one.

301
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,066
Look--hello!
She's got it.

302
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,934
- And what is Manila playing?

303
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:02,900
- This is the Tweaker.

304
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,834
- Tweaker the she-monkey?
- Yes.

305
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,266
- That's hot.

306
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,133
You do have to create
your own language.

307
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,467
- Yes.

308
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,266
- Can you give us a little
taste of what that sounds like?

309
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:12,333
- I'm gonna be like...

310
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,266
[high-pitched babbling]

311
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,734
- That's beautiful.

312
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,700
- She ordered the Cobb salad.

313
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,633
- Yeah, she...
[laughter]

314
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,834
Now, I want to hear the twins do
a line together.

315
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,200
- Twinbots,
stay on the lookout.

316
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,934
both: We are on the lookout...

317
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,066
for single guys.

318
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,567
[both giggle]

319
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,433
- [laughs]

320
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,200
Oscar!

321
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,333
All right, ladies, work hard.

322
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,367
I don't want to see drag queens;

323
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,400
I want to see movie stars.

324
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,734
All right, get to work.

325
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,934
all: Thank you.

326
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,700
- Team Mariah.

327
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,300
- Hey, Ru, what's happening?

328
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,900
- The cast of<i> Return to Uranus.</i>

329
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
This is an epic.

330
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,300
Now, Mariah, what role
are you playing?

331
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
- Uh, the milkmaid.

332
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,533
[laughter]

333
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,233
No, I'm playing Boobarella.

334
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,133
- You assigned yourself
the lead role.

335
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,333
- Actually, I think it was
slightly unanimous.

336
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,767
- [laughs]

337
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,166
Now, you all picked the sequel.

338
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,100
As you well know, most of
the time, sequels suck.

339
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,367
So you have your work cut out
for you.

340
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:18,500
Make sure
that it's a hit picture.

341
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,600
- Yes.

342
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,867
- All right,
I'm gonna leave you ladies

343
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,133
to get camera ready.

344
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,533
- Cool.
- Good luck.

345
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,767
all: Thank you.

346
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:30,367
- Ladies, on the set, you'll be
visited by Michelle Visage

347
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,100
and our extra-special
guest judge,

348
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,367
the star of the sci-fi series
<i>Caprica,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

349
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:41,767
my favorite Cylon,
Alessandra Torresani.

350
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,367
- Oh, awesome.
[applause]

351
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,934
- Alessandra Torresani.

352
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,533
She is fierce.

353
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:50,300
- Now, they'll be here
to give you some pointers.

354
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,133
This is your chance to shine.

355
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,934
So lights, camera,

356
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,700
and don't fuck it up.

357
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,066
- Okay.
- Okay.

358
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,233
- Got it.

359
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,133
- Good luck, bitches.

360
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,633
- Good luck.
- Thanks, baby.

361
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,834
- I want to know why was I
fucking picked last.

362
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,333
- I don't know.
Why do you think?

363
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,300
- Do you think Phoenix
didn't pick me on purpose?

364
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,633
- I don't know.

365
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,800
- I heard she was--I heard that
she was threatened by me.

366
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,200
- She's threatened by you?

367
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,533
- Or she thought I was
her competition.

368
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,700
- I mean, if she's threatened
by you,

369
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,567
then she would think
that you were good,

370
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,934
and then that would be a benefit
to her

371
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,066
to have you on her team.

372
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,066
- Yeah.

373
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,066
- If she was strategizing

374
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,367
the way you think
she's strategizing.

375
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,700
- I just don't know.

376
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,333
- I didn't think that Phoenix
was threatened by her.

377
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,967
Phoenix hasn't mentioned that.

378
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,867
And I don't know what she could
possibly be threatened by.

379
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:40,834
Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first,

380
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,433
and I don't even think
she's second.

381
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,934
I don't think anyone's placing
any bets on her.

382
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,867
- Hey, hey.

383
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,500
- Team Phoenix is on the set

384
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,533
of<i> Drag Queens in Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>

385
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,433
- Greetings, ladies.

386
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,233
all: Hi.

387
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,500
- I'd like to introduce you to
our guest judge today.

388
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
This is Alessandra.

389
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,467
- Hi, guys.
How are you?

390
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,934
- We will be directing
your performances today.

391
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,166
Let's get this show on the road.

392
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,400
- Let's do it.
- Bring it.

393
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,900
- Okay.

394
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,166
- Take one.

395
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,266
- Tata, twinbots,

396
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,266
we must intercept
the queen's spaceship,

397
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:26,133
or the balls will be held
in Uranus...

398
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,166
forever.

399
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,300
- Cut!

400
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,734
Delta.
- Yes.

401
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,467
- The line is "the queen's balls
will be<i> stuck</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

402
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,967
in Uranus forever."

403
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,133
"Stuck" is the punch.
- Okay.

404
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,066
We must intercept
Hermaphrodite's spaceship,

405
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,700
or the queen's balls will be
stuck in her anus.

406
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,166
- That would be "Uranus."

407
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,767
Just so we're clear,
it's "Uranus."

408
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:45,800
It's a planet.

409
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,967
Family show, honey.

410
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,066
- At this point, I realize

411
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,400
I should have probably spent
more time

412
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,533
memorizing my lines
than primping my hair.

413
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,767
- Action.

414
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,734
- We've arrived on
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.

415
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,300
Prepare to tranny-port
in three, two, one.

416
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,667
all: Dragonauts away!

417
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,133
- Phoenix, you're delivering
all your lines

418
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,100
away from the camera.

419
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,400
We need to see
your gorgeous face.

420
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,433
- Okay.

421
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,400
- Tata, twinbots,
stay on the lookout.

422
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,600
both: We are on the lookout...

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,400
for single guys.

424
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,700
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.

425
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,266
Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.

426
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,667
- Phoenix.
- Yes?

427
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,734
- You keep looking away, girl.

428
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,467
You're giving somebody else
your time.

429
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,667
- Okay.

430
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,934
- I'm like, "Bitch,
just get it together."

431
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,967
- Phoenix, what's your
character feeling right now?

432
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,100
- I think I'm kind of...

433
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,433
I don't really know.

434
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,800
- Exactly.

435
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,300
- Phoenix, let's say that you
are super scared.

436
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
- Okay.

437
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,533
- But you're trying
not to show it,

438
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,200
because you're trying to
impress Boobarella.

439
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,934
- Let's give you one more shot,
Phoenix.

440
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,800
Full of emotion, baby.
We know you got it.

441
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
- Okay.

442
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,400
- Twinbots, be on the lookout.

443
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,166
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.

444
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,633
all: Dragonauts, away!

445
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,633
- Cut.

446
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,934
Okay, Raja and Manila.

447
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,500
- The idea of having
Michelle Visage sitting there

448
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,100
terrifies me a little bit,
because that woman scares me.

449
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
- And action.

450
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,500
- [chitters]

451
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,767
[laughter]

452
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,266
- I'm wearing the smallest
little leotard,

453
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,233
and I'm getting
a huge cameltoe.

454
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,967
Tweaker got pipe.

455
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,600
- Manila, you're all ears,
girl.

456
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,967
- Hmm?

457
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,633
[laughter]

458
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,233
- Action.

459
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,133
- The most gorgeous woman
in the universe?

460
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,333
Don't you need to be a woman
first?

461
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,867
- Kill 'em, Tweaker!

462
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,400
- Whaaa!

463
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,734
[imitating lasers firing]

464
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:43,266
- Manila, do not make fake
sound effect gun noises.

465
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:46,433
It's not your backyard.
It's a movie, darlings.

466
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,500
- I don't know.

467
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,233
- Just look gorgeous
and do your lines.

468
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,367
Action!

469
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,333
- Say what?
- Action?

470
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,400
- Oh.
[laughter]

471
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
- Lady Tata is to become...

472
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,467
my bride.

473
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,633
- Lady Tata would never marry
a Martian like you.

474
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,867
- Cut. Tata, you're giving us
Maya Angelou.

475
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,333
Give us just a little bit more
Maya Angelou.

476
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,533
- Okay.

477
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,767
[laughter]

478
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:20,500
- I am from Crab Nebula, bitch!

479
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,834
- Yeah, Mimi, take it back
a little bit.

480
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:23,900
- Okay.

481
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,967
- Lower the energy
a little bit.

482
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,567
- Okay.
- Action!

483
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,333
- [screams]

484
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,066
- Miss Mimi.

485
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,700
There's a difference
in being talented

486
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,834
and being a showboat.

487
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:40,533
- Boobarella, I see you've
increased your war chest.

488
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,066
- Can I get the line?

489
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,600
- "Prepare to gag on my"...

490
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
- Thank you.

491
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,533
Prepare to gag on my eleganza!

492
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:50,567
[shrieks]

493
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,433
both: Get her, Boobarella!

494
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,767
- Shut the fuck up.

495
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,767
- No!
"Go fuck yourself."

496
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,500
- Go fuck yourself.

497
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,367
My lines have to be fed to me
a little bit,

498
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,066
and I'm like, "Oh, my god.

499
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:07,667
Please do not let me lead
these ladies off a cliff."

500
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,567
- [high-pitched babbling]

501
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,133
both: Has anyone ever told you
you look like an Ewok?

502
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,066
- The hardest part of my role

503
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,734
is to have to share it
with Shangela.

504
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:19,834
I wanted my spotlight.

505
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:20,834
both: Stop flirting!

506
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,066
You stop flirting!

507
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,266
Shut up!
No, you shut up!

508
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:27,934
Oh! Oh!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

509
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,133
- Alexis and I,
as the twinbots,

510
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,266
we delivered when
we hit that set.

511
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,166
both: Dragonauts, away!

512
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,867
- And cut.
Nicely done.

513
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,900
Okay, that's a wrap, ladies.

514
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,066
Congratulations.

515
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,700
[cheers and applause]

516
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,166
Your sci-fi trailers will make
their world premiere

517
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,367
on the main stage tomorrow.

518
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,400
[cheers and applause]

519
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,834
Very exciting.

520
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,433
And Ru has asked you all to come

521
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:55,967
decked out in your finest
space-age couture.

522
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,734
[people gasp]

523
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,066
And we will be joined

524
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,100
by our extra-special, far-out
guest judge,

525
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,900
the legendary Lily Tomlin.

526
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,734
[cheers and applause]

527
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:10,433
- Lily motherfucking Tomlin.

528
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:14,333
You--you really--you don't get
better than that.

529
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,900
- All right, so until then,
live long and prosper.

530
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,433
[cheering]

531
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,100
[alarm beeps]

532
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,533
- Just as we left it.

533
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,767
- We're back in the work room.

534
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,166
Today we're getting ready for
the runway,

535
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,100
and we're all gonna get
decked up

536
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,266
in our shiny, metallic,
futuristic realness.

537
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,867
Miss Manila?
- Yeah?

538
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,633
- My hair is sticking through
in that wig.

539
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,700
Can you trim it?

540
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,967
- What, shave your hair?

541
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,033
- No, I just need you
to just trim the back.

542
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,200
- Can't you get someone else,
like the Delta or someone,

543
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,533
that does hair to do it?

544
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,633
- Mimi starts asking
the other queens,

545
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:58,100
"Will someone come over
and shave my head?"

546
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,767
Girl, what if I shave my head?

547
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,834
- And maybe have, like,
a little piece of hair

548
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,533
hanging down on the side?

549
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,700
That would be cute.

550
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,300
And have, like, a little
spit curl in the front.

551
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
- Do you want
to shave it real quick?

552
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
- Oh, uh-uh.
I don't have time, babe.

553
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,166
- I understand going
the extra mile,

554
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,734
but this is nothing but Mimi
pulling another production.

555
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,867
Her name should be
Cimi Imfurst,

556
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,400
because every time
we turn around,

557
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
she's doing something
for someone

558
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,100
to "see me, see me, see me."

559
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,100
- I feel so vulnerable.

560
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,433
I didn't hit the mark
in the challenge.

561
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,967
I wish I would have spent
a little more time

562
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,300
memorizing my lines,

563
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,700
because I expected more
from myself.

564
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,500
I hate how this thing, like--

565
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,533
you know what I mean?

566
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,467
Like, how is that even
a tight bobbin?

567
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,066
Like, that is not even
gonna work.

568
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:50,867
Now my job is to amp up
what it is that I wear,

569
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,133
how I conduct myself
on the runway.

570
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:57,400
I need to basically give 300%,
not 100%,

571
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,834
'cause it's just not enough.

572
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,333
Forget it. I'm using
somebody else's machine.

573
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,300

How cyborg.

574
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,400
- Yeah, right.

575
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,967
- Yeah, your look is gonna be
on point.

576
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,100
- We will see.

577
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,467
I am team leader.

578
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,200
You know, I want to make sure
everything's perfect.

579
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I need it to be on point.

580
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,233
I'm, like, a fucking nerv--

581
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,400
I, like, never get nervous.

582
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,767
- Why was I the villain?

583
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,066
Do you think of me as a villain?

584
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:22,400
- Yeah.
- How so?

585
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,367
- You could be antagonistic
if you--

586
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,367
- [laughs]

587
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,567
- Mimi, do you feel

588
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,066
that you worked well
with everyone in the group?

589
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,233
- I think so.

590
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,900
I think we had definitely
some clashing, but--

591
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
- Who clashed?

592
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,100
- I think you and I clashed,
girl.

593
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,200
- I think it's because

594
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,667
we both have
very strong personalities.

595
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,166
We both had an idea

596
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,066
of how we wanted the production
and our role to go.

597
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,900
But in the end,
you have to release

598
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,266
and trust each actor to be able
to take the role on

599
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,467
and put their own self into it.

600
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,600
- I'm really proud
of my performance

601
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,734
in the trailer.

602
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,200
I really think I hit it
out of the park.

603
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,066
- Shangela underestimated me,

604
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,600
but I know what I can do,
and now she does too.

605
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,166
So you're cool?
Me and you cool?

606
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,700
- Girl, we're always cool.

607
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Listen, you can take nothing
personal in this life.

608
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,667
- Indeed.
- It has to be really severe.

609
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,967
- I look over, and Mimi puts on
this headpiece,

610
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,800
and I think she looks like
Uncle Fester

611

from<i> Addams Family,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> honestly.</i>

612

in hold for me

I'm sparkling.

- Oh, my god, those eyes.

693
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,233
- She's serving satellite TV.

00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,066
Oh, my stars.

695
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,400
That's some kind of futuristic
chastity belt.

696
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,667
- So I'm on the runway, praying
I don't trip over these shoes,

697
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,567
'cause they are a bitch
to walk in,

698
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:03,567

But I'm feeling good.

700

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
She's blinding me with science.

703
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,433
- I'm walking that runway,
and I'm thinking,

704
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,767
"This hair better not come off,

"and I'll just shake my ass
a little bit

707
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,734
and just hope for the best."

708
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,266
- She's an astronaut.

709
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,734
- She's got a mind
for rocket science

710
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,567
but a body for sin.

711
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,633
Look who we have here.

712
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,266
Representing Atlanta, Mariah.

713
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:33,834
- Our hair looks very similar,
doesn't it?

714
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,233
- Yes, it does.

715
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:38,500
- I truly feel like supermodel
of the universe.

716
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,867
I am stomping that runway.

717
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,934
- She's not having any trouble
with her Tribbles.

718
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:48,400
All right, Delta Work.

719
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,533
She's giving us a total eclipse
of the heart.

720
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:54,333
- I'm hoping the judges are
going to love the difference

721
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,767
between what I'm wearing

722
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:59,066
and the sort of
metal-colored-inspired costumes

723
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,200
that they're seeing.

724
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,133
- She's a real Judy Jetsetter.

725
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,066
Next up, Manila Luzon.

726
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:09,500
That ensemble is just rocking
my universe.

727
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,767
- I'm coming down the runway,

728
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:14,200
and I'm giving evil henchwoman
realness.

729
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,500
I kind of wanted to separate
myself from the other girls,

730
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,800
because I think a lot of girls

731
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,900
kind of had, like,
a similar look.

732
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,266
- She's got a big dipper too.
- She sure do.

733
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,400
- Welcome, dolls.

734
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,767
Now it's blockbuster time.

735
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,700
Team Phoenix, let's take a look
at your trailer.

736
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,400
Help me, Boobarella.

737
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,166
You're my only hope.

738
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,667
- Whoo!

739
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,867
- Delta Work as Boobarella.

740
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:47,734
- I have a hunch things are
about to get a little ugly.

741
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:50,300
Twinbots, be on the lookout.

742
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,367
both: We are on the lookout...

743
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,934
for single guys.

744
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,166
[laughter]

745
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,100
- Carmen Carrera and
India Ferrah as the twinbots.

746
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,233
both: Resetting course.

747
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,433
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three...

748
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:05,066
- Phoenix as Lady Tata.

749
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,333
- Two, and one.

750
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,633
- [laughs]

751
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,600
[warbling]

752
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Bimborella.
You looking for these?

753
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,767
both: Give us back those balls.

754
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,533
- Sarlaccs!

755
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,667
- Raja as Hermaphrodite.

756
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,066
- No one can hear you
lip-synching in space.

757
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,600
Prepare to die.

758
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,300
- [high-pitched babbling]

759
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,066
- That's right, Tweaker.

760
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:32,166
- And Manila Luzon as Tweaker.

761
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:35,500
- Whoo!
Shama-la-la-la-la bing bong.

762
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,233
[weapons whooshing]

763
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:44,934
[laughter]

764
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,166
- Cute.

765
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,533
Wonderful.

766
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,200
- The other group
was all over the map.

767
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm feeling really confident.

768
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
I think we could win this thing.

769
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,400
- Next up, Team Mariah.

770
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,500
Let's take a look at the sequel.

771
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,333
- [cackling]

772
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,700
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.

773
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,400
- Mariah as Boobarella.

774
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,700
- [shrieks]

775
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,734
There's something
I want you to know!

776
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:18,633
I am...your father.

777
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:22,333
- Mimi Imfurst as
Hermaphrodite.

778
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,300
- And your mother!

779
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,133
- Go fuck yourself.

780
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,300
- I did!

781
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,967
That's why I'm your father
and your mother!

782
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,967
- Ew!

783
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,867
- Stacy Layne Matthews
as Lady Tata.

784
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,033
- The gas levels indicate
that Uranus is burning.

785
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,100
both: Hey, Tweaker.

786
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,333
Stop flirting.
You stop flirting.

787
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,033
Shut up!
No, you shut up.

788
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:51,600
- Shangela and Alexis Mateo
as the twinbots.

789
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,000
- [screeching]

790
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,500
- Tweaker, no!

791
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,266
- Yara Sofia as Tweaker.

792
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:00,133
all: Dragonauts, away!

793
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,433
- Damn you, Boobarella...

794
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,333
Ella--ella--ay--ay--ay.

795
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,867
[screams]

796
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,567
[laughter]

797
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:22,233
- I am so happy, 'cause I was
so worried about my accent.

798
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:24,233
But it actually came out
very cute.

799
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:27,800
I'm so proud of myself
right now.

800
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,200
- Ladies, the reviews are in.

801
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,700
And based on your<i> Drag Queens</i>
<i>in Outer Space</i><span style="bodyStyle"> movie trailers,</i>

802
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,500
we've made some decisions.

803
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,500
The winning team is...

804
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,333
[dramatic music]

805
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,266
Team Mariah,<i> Return to Uranus.</i>

806
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,233
[people cheering]

807
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,200
Condragulations.
You are all safe.

808
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,100
- Thank you.
- Yes!

809
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,700
- But three of you emerged as
breakout stars.

810
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,100
Shangela.

811
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,867
Alexis.

812
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:06,400
The twinbots.

813
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,734
Mimi Imfurst.

814
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,734
- I'm feeling super confident.

815
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:14,233
Comparing myself
to everyone else in my group,

816
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,967
I think that I stand a good
chance of winning this one.

817
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:21,066
- I can only choose one.

818
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,066
Oh, damn the rules.

819
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:27,066
Let's call it a tie.

820
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:30,934
Shangela, Alexis,
condragulations.

821
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,500
You have won this challenge.

822
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,533
Each of you will receive a set

823
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:40,066
of hand-sculpted silicone
breastplates

824
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:43,600

825
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,433
[cheering and laughing]

826
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:50,100
Did you hear that, Lily?
Boobsforqueens.com.

827
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,533
- Yes, I did.
[laughter]

828
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:56,633
- However, neither one of you

829
00:32:56,633 --> 00:33:01,066
will be granted immunity
next week.

830
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,066
Team Mariah.

831
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,567
Thank you, ladies.

832
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,166
You may leave the stage.

833
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,633
Team Phoenix.

834
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:19,200
Each of you is up for
elimination

835
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,633
except, of course, for Raja.

836
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,433
You have immunity.

837
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:28,767
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

838
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,266
Let's start with Phoenix.

839
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:33,133
What'd you think of Lady Tata?

840
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,967
- I think you could have been
a little zanier,

841
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,467
especially with a name like
Lady Tata.

842
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:40,367
- I do believe that you were
the weakest link in this cast.

843
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,800
- You just didn't commit.

844
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,066
Because you had fewer lines,
you should have committed 150%

845
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,867
just to show up everyone else.

846
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,400
- India Ferrah.

847
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,166
- I was very taken
with your bosoms.

848
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:56,100
I thought they were just
completely believable--

849
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,600
from this distance, anyway.

850
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,066
- I love, love, love this look.
- Thank you.

851
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:03,233
- This is Judy Jetson
does Vegas.

852
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:04,266
- Thank you, India.

853
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:07,633
All right, up next,
Carmen Carrera.

854
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:10,367
Now, Carmen, you're having some
trouble with your headpiece.

855
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:11,967
- This is, like, kind of
a mixture of super glue

856
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,934
and spray adhesive to my head.

857
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:16,800
It's literally pulling the hairs
out of my scalp.

858
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
- It's such an extraordinary
waistline.

859
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,266
It's just incredible.

860
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,300
You must have had a rib removed.

861
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,100
- I think your outfit today

862
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,433
is poorly conceived
and poorly designed.

863
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,467
- Carmen, stop relying
on that body.

864
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:33,967
- All right.
Thank you, Carmen.

865
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:37,166
Manila,
tell us about your outfit.

866
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:41,233
- I wanted to do, like, a
really sexy, like, Grace Jones,

867
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:43,934
Thierry Mugler-inspired,
like, catsuit.

868
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:44,900
- Well, you failed.

869
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,734
- [laughs]
- No, just joking.

870
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,100
- I thought your character
was great.

871
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,367
- Thank you.

872
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,734
- Very original and unexpected
and totally committed.

873
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:55,600
- Thanks, Manila.

874
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,233
Delta Work!

875
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,567
- You could've gone way out
with that Boobarella character.

876
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:04,333
You seemed more like a
combination of divine and Dali.

877
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,800
And I liked that.

878
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,233
- What is futuristic
about this look?

879
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,667
It looks a little dated, and
other than it being shiny,

880
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,734
I don't see space.

881
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:16,133
I don't see sci-fi.

882
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,467
I don't see the future.

883
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,066
- I sort of was inspired

884
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:23,533
by the look of that 1950s
and '60s feeling

885
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:26,300
of what space-age would be.

886
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,667
- Now, what about
her performance as Boobarella?

887
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,166
- In the performance aspect,

888
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,800
you had to do
a million things at once.

889
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,166
I think for your first time
on film,

890
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,633
I think that was a very hard
character for you to play,

891
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,567
but you did listen to us.

892
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,533
- All right, ladies.

893
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:47,166
I want a piece of advice
from you.

894
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,900
Who should be going home
tonight?

895
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,400
Manila.

896
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:56,500
- I think...

897
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,467
Phoenix.

898
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:58,834
She was our leader,

899
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:02,200
and I think that the leader
has to take responsibility.

900
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Carmen.

901
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,834
- I kind of agree with Manila.

902
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,066
She was our leader.

903
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:07,967
- India.

904
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,266
- Phoenix,
one of the first things

905
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:10,533
she actually told us to do

906
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:13,166
was, you know, change our voices
for our characters,

907
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:17,800
so that's one of the things that
I expected from her as well.

908
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,367
- All right, Phoenix.

909
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,200
- I think for you to come out

910
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,100
in just a catsuit
that I have 15 of,

911
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,433
I don't really think
that's worth $75,000.

912
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,266
- But you're wearing
a catsuit.

913
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:34,233
- I think that I've got
so much more of a $75,000 look.

914
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,333
- Manila, is there something
you want to say

915
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,567
about your $75,000 catsuit?

916
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:39,567
- [laughs]

917
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,967
- I got this made for $100,

918
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,300
so I guess I could make
75...uh, hundred.

919
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,333
- Do the math, honey.

920
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,934
- I'm Asian,
but I don't do math.

921
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:48,600
[laughter]
Sorry.

922
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
- All right.

923
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
All right, Delta,
it's your turn.

924
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,900
Who do you think should go home
tonight?

925
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,567
- Based on the runway
presentation,

926
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,834
I would say myself.

927
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,567
- All right, Raja.

928
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,500
- I just don't like the idea of
the possibility

929
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,934
of my friend leaving,
'cause Delta and I--

930
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,200
I was so excited to see my
very good friend here with me

931
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,066
in this process.

932
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:11,066
I hope that if she has to
lip-synch for her life,

933
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:14,767
that she fucking lip-syncs
for her mother[bleep] life.

934
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,266
You know what I'm saying?
- Amen.

935
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:18,066
- Thank you, Raja.

936
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,300
Thank you, ladies.

937
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,133
Now, while you untuck in
The Interior Illusions Lounge,

938
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:26,667
the judges and I will
deliberate.

939
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,100
You may leave the stage.

940
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,133
All right, ladies, ladies.

941
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,800
Just between us girls,

942
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,133
let's start with Phoenix.

943
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,467
- I was gagging.

944
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:41,600
She was horrible, and she didn't
look very good either.

945
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,266
- She was definitely nervous
the whole time.

946
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:46,467
- But her runway ensemble today

947
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:49,066
looked really futuristic
and great.

948
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,233
- India Ferrah.

949
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,667
- Well, I liked her costume.

950
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,500
It was nicely pulled together
and interesting.

951
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,667
- I was saying, are we gonna
see the boobs every time?

952
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,533
- I have a feeling, yes.
- Yeah?

953
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,700
- [laughs]

954
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,967
- On to Carmen.

955
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,300
- I didn't think her costume
was well designed.

956
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,700
- It's a bikini with a corset.

957
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,233
- She came out, and she had
her sort of head pulled down

958
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:11,433
so that the thing--I thought
she had osteoporosis.

959
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:12,934
- You wanted to give her
some calcium.

960
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:13,967
- Yes!

961
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,867
Is she out of her league?

962
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,800
- She needs to step up
her game.

963
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,100
- Now Manila.

964
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,967
She took what could have been
a disaster of a role,

965
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,433
and she ran with it.

966
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:24,834
- Oh, yeah.
She was great.

967
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,333
- Delta Work.

968
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,867
When she described what she was
doing, a retro look,

969
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,100
I understood it.

970
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,066
It's just the execution of it
wasn't well done.

971
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,367
Did she have trouble
with her dialog?

972
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:36,500
- She did indeed.

973
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,533
We had to go over that
quite a few times.

974
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:41,633
But she really wanted to get it
right, bless her heart.

975
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,266
She wasn't like...
[scoffs]

976
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,800
Like, she really was listening
and really took the direction.

977
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,967
I thought we were happy

978
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,800
with some of the decisions
she made as an actress.

979
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,700
- Now, the decisions she made
as a stylist

980
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,667
on the runway tonight,
not so much?

981
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,233
- She's contacting
a different person in her head.

982
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,900
- Yeah.
- It didn't look Judy Jetson.

983
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,066
- I felt like when she was
standing next to everybody else,

984
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,333
she felt, like, almost sheepish.

985
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,834
- Silence!

986
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:10,433
Bring back my girls.

987
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:16,667
Welcome back, ladies.

988
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,400
I've made some decisions.

989
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,800
Raja, you have immunity.

990
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,066
- Yes, I do.

991
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:25,834
- You're safe.
- Thanks.

992
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:29,600
- Manila, you had us at...

993
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,367
[high-pitched babbling]

994
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,633
Condragulations.
You're safe.

995
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:40,500
- Thank you.

996
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,100
- Phoenix, now, as team leader
and Lady Tata,

997
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,266
you let us down.

998
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:52,133
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

999
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,834
- I do not want to go home

1000
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:58,133
up against people that are
not as good as I am.

1001
00:39:58,133 --> 00:39:59,934
- India Ferrah.

1002
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,100
Condragulations, you are safe.

1003
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,100
Carmen.

1004
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,400
Your runway presentation was
weak and lacked vision.

1005
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,200
Delta,
your Boobarella was curvaceous,

1006
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,333
but your look on the main stage
left us flat.

1007
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,200
Carmen...

1008
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,467
you're safe.

1009
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,433
- Thank you.

1010
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,567
- Delta, my dear, I'm sorry,

1011
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,767
but you are up for elimination.

1012
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,000
- I knew that Ru was gonna
announce me

1013
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,266
to lip-sync for my life.

1014
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:51,700
I don't know that I should have
been there,

1015
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,834
but I didn't think our entire
team should have been there.

1016
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,667
I mean, I thought it was a load
of crap.

1017
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:59,200
- Two queens stand before me.

1018
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,967
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1019
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:07,066
and save yourselves
from elimination.

1020
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:13,200
The time has come for you
to lip-sync

1021
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,967
for your life.

1022
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Don't copy anyone else.

1046
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:11,367

1047

[applause]

1068
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,367
- Wow.

1069
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,233
- Phoenix.

1070
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,467
Delta.

1071
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:10,500
I have made my decision.

1072
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,533
Delta Work.

1073
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,900
Shantay, you stay.

1077
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,700
- [whispers] I'm so happy.

1078
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,533
- Phoenix.

1079
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,133
Rising from the ashes.

1080
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:39,834
For a great queen like you,

1081
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:43,066
this is just the beginning.

1082
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:46,900

1085
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:53,834
- We love you.

1086
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,333
- For me to go home and some of
these people remain

1087
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,834
is very crazy to me,

1088
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,100
especially when I look

1089
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,066
at certain people
in this competition

1090
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:04,934
that definitely are not the best
that America has to offer.

1091
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:12,567
- Ladies, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1092
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,500
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1093
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,233
Can I get an "amen" in here?

1094
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:17,266
all: Amen!

1095
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:19,767
- Now let the music play.

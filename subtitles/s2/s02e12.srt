4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,734
- Some of these girls
in the competition

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:10,967
need a personality lift.

6
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:12,700
- Fuck you too, bitch.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,367
-<i> Watch as my girls dish</i>
<i>a little bit of love...</i>

8
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:16,800
- Pray for me
and pray for my son.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,400
- That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,667
-<i> And a whole lot of shade.</i>

11
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,533
- This woman's gonna cuss me
the [...] out.

12
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:24,533
[laughing]

13
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,767
- Hey, I'm not done talking yet.

14
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:26,834
You will speak when I'm done.

15
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,467
- Ooh.
- Security.

16
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,800
-<i> And we announce your choice</i>

[car engines racing]

20
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:59,467
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i>

21
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,667
People are always asking,

22
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,333
"RuPaul, what's the secret
to the show's success?"

23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,233
Well, the answer is simple.

24
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:12,066
It's magic.

25
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,834
Before your very eyes,

26
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:17,467
12 supernatural men turn
into bewitching beauties

27
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:21,066
and do things that mere mortals
can only dream about.

28
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:23,967
Why, these drag queens
are just plain wicked.

29
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,166
And they got more tricks

30
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,133
than Jesse James
and Tiger Woods combined.

31
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,300
And just as they cast
their spell upon the nation,

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,934
one by one--poof, poof--
they vanish.

33
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,834
But tonight, through the magic
of television,

34
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,867
you can thank your lucky stars,

35
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,700
because all our queens
are back--

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,867
tucked, plucked,
and ready to conjure up

37
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:48,200
a little realness.

38
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:54,567
First up, these two queens came
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

39
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,233
representing the South.

40
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:01,400
Can I get a big hallelu for
Miss Shangela Laquifa Wadley,

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,734
and from Atlanta, Georgia,

42
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,266
Miss Nicole Paige Brooks.

43
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:09,633
Next up, Miss Two-Piece
and a Biscuit herself,

44
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:12,066
Mystique Summers Madison.

45
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,533
The last time these two queens
were together,

46
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,133
they were lip-synching
for their lives.

47
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:22,834
Please welcome back Sonique
and Morgan McMichaels.

48
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,233
Hello, ladies.

49
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,367
all: Hi.

50
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,200
- [laughs]

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,066
All right, girls, let's dish.

52
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,200
- Uh-oh.

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,400
- Shangela, was that corn
on your wrist?

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,734
- Ooh! Yes!

55
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:39,767
This is my new Gaga-inspired
"cornsage."

56
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,200
- A-mazing.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,400
- Yes, I've learned a little bit
in the last year.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,066
- Now, you'd been doing drag

59
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,734
for just a few months
before coming to<i> Drag Race.</i>

60
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,266
Do you think you were too green
to be on<i> Drag Race?</i>

61
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,467
- No, I definitely came
to this competition to compete,

62
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,767
to be a drag superstar.

63
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,800
I mean, did you see the
lip-synch for your life? Okay?

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,333
I definitely came to party
with the people.

65
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,100
But you guys said that I needed
a little bit more time.

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,867
This wasn't RuPaul's school
for girls, all right?

67
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,967
All right!

68
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,967
So I left, learned a little
something,

69
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,200
and then went and won

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,834
this California Entertainer
of the Year pageant

71
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:17,066
and came home with a crown, ow.

72
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,667
- Okay.
[laughing]

73
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,834
So you're snatching trophies
and corn.

74
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,367
- Honey, I'm snatching
everything,

75
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,667
and hopefully a husband is next.

76
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,934
Hallelu.

77
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,266
- Thank you.

78
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:30,734
All right, Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.

79
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:31,900
- Yes, sir.

80
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,700
- I know that you are
a fierce drag mama.

81
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,066
Uh, you're also
a fierce drag papa.

82
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,100
- Yes.

83
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,700
- Did your son get
to see the show?

84
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
- He saw the Barbie part,
when we did the Barbies,

85
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,066
and he's like,
"Oh, Da-da's on TV."

86
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,066
And he got really excited.

87
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,567
But, um, he hasn't seen Nicole
yet.

88
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,066
But there's pictures of me
all over the house,

89
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,066
and you ask him who that is,

90
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,100
and he's like, "I don't know."

91
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,700
I don't think that it's all come
together yet, but it will.

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,633
- How old is he?

93
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,100
- He's four.

94
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,834
- Now, you didn't last as long
as some people predicted.

95
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:58,800
- Yeah.

96
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,867
- Now, what were
your frustrations

97
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,266
with the competition?

98
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:06,333
- I really...liked all
the sorority of the girls.

99
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,300
You know, we were pretty unified
when we were here.

100
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,700
And then I was shocked to see

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,600
Raven talking about everybody
behind our backs.

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,900
To be honest, my feelings--

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,667
- Were you really?
- I was really surprised.

104
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,834
- Really?

105
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,333
See, I thought Raven was
very up-front, like me.

106
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,100
- You didn't say nothin'
behind my back.

107
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,266
- No, of course, not, but,

108
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,600
like, I didn't think Raven did
either.

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,500
- Well, we will discuss that
when Raven comes out.

110
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,467
- Yeah.

111
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,066
- All right, Mystique.

112
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,700
Now, you said you were bringing
up the plus-size gals.

113
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,066
Did you get a lot of support
from the community?

114
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,367
- Yes, I got a lot of people

115
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:42,734
saying, "Thank you for showing
me that I can go out there

116
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:48,633
and just be me and not conform
to, like, society's thoughts."

117
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,633
- Now, some people felt
that you had given up

118
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:52,900
on the last challenge,

119
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,066
that you had sort
of thrown in the towel.

120
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,567
- There's a lot of issues
with that.

121
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,633
I live in Dallas, Fort Worth.

122
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,767
And a lot of the gangs and stuff
was acting up in Mexico,

123
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,400
and they was kidnapping
Americans.

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,066
'Cause my mom works in Mexico.

125
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:11,600
So that morning, I heard that a
lot of Americans was kidnapped.

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,567
So in my head, I was like,

127
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,166
"I don't know
if it's my mom there."

128
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,867
- She's not a drug mule,
is she?

129
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,233
- No, she is not!

130
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,300
- She was okay, right?

131
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
- She was okay, be--

132
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,734
- Well, I have to ask, then,

133
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,500
about why the<i> schmatta</i><span style="bodyStyle"> blouse</i>
and the black pants.

134
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,367
- I mean, the black pants,
they were busted.

135
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:30,333
- But the thing is, I wanted
to be, like, you know,

136
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,300
the up-to-date,
country type of thing.

137
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,934
- Time out! Please.
Real quick.

138
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,867
I'm a native Texan.

139
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,900
And you said I'm representing

140
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,066
the people who really dress
like this in Texas.

141
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,533
This is representative
of how we dress.

142
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,066
That is not representative of
how everyone dresses in Texas.

143
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,166
And your makeup skills are not

144
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,467
how everyone in Texas
does makeup.

145
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,567
- True.

146
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,367
- Well, Mystique, you look
beautiful tonight.

147
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,967
- Thank you.
- You look gorgeous.

148
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,967
All right, Sonique.

149
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:52,934
- Hi.

150
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,633
- Now, I gotta say,
the elimination

151
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,800
between you and Morgan

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,367
was one of the toughest
I've ever done.

153
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,100
'Cause you were both incredible.

154
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,333
- Thank you.

155
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,900
- Did I get it right, though?

156
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,433
- I actually--I don't know.

157
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,367
I thought I was prepared
and everything like that,

158
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,166
and I've learned so much more
about myself

159
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,633
and about my drag
and everything.

160
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,066
But I--I felt like
the whole time I was here,

161
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,333
I was in a dream.

162
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:22,133
- Was it a sweet dream or
a beautiful nightmare for you?

163
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,066
- My mind was always
somewhere else.

164
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,166
- Like, where else?
What are you talking about?

165
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,367
- I don't really feel
that people got a chance

166
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,500
to get to know who Sonique is.

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,200
- And I've heard that there's

168
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
something you want to share
with us concerning that.

169
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,100
- I don't know,
I was always just so...

170
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,066
Um...it's very personal,

171
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,333
and I don't want to...

172
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:49,967
- Can I check on her?

173
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,900
- We'll give her a moment.

174
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,500
- [crying] I know
they don't understand.

175
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,467
And that's--
and that's the reason why

176
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,767
I've been so unhappy
for so long.

177
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,066
- Hey, kiddo, you okay?

178
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,166
What is it, honey?

179
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,133
Talk to me.

180
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,834
- I haven't been happy for
a really long time in my life.

181
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:16,900
And I've never understood why.

182
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,367
I just had to be honest
with myself and...

183
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,200
I've...

184
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,233
I'm a woman.

185
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:28,633
I'm not a boy who dresses up.

186
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,834
The--I feel like the only thing
I've ever done right

187
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:35,600
was go to a doctor
and start transitioning.

188
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,233
I've never been more happier
in my entire life.

189
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,400
- Good.

190
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,433
You want--would you...
join the group again?

191
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,600
- Yeah.

192
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,266
- Maybe we could talk
a little bit about it.

193
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,667
- I'm proud of you.
- Come on, baby.

194
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,066
- Thank you.
I'm so happy.

195
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,066
How's my makeup look?

196
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,467
- Destroyed, bitch.

197
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,667
- Don't do that to me.

198
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:58,800
- All right, ladies,
Sonique is back.

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,700
Do you feel safe to share
something with the group?

200
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,433
- I always knew that there
wasn't something right.

201
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,567
I couldn't ever be boy enough.

202
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,500
I've always been a girl.

203
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,567
I've always been a girl
trapped in a boy's body.

204
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,133
I started doing drag.

205
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:19,900
And...there was just something
about it that wasn't enough.

206
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,934
And I've--I went to a doctor,

207
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,133
and he put me on testosterone
blockers,

208
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,367
and then moved me to hormones,

209
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,066
and my levels are even,

210
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,867
and I've never been happier
in my whole life.

211
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,433
- Well, I know a lot of people
get it confused--

212
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,667
what a transsexual is and what--

213
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:40,233
- There's a line between drag
and transgender.

214
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:43,367
Most transgender girls
do not do drag.

215
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:47,066
You know, they want to live
their life solely as a woman,

216
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:52,066
where drag queens want to get
out of drag and be a man.

217
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,567
When I go home, I ne--
I dread taking off my makeup.

218
00:08:55,567 --> 00:09:00,467
- Listen, I'm so happy and proud
of you for being so courageous.

219
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,066
'Cause I know how hard that is.

220
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,100
You know, I--I'm a man,
I do drag,

221
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,834
and that's what I do for work.

222
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,333
But for you to make
this realization,

223
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,500
to be happy performing
but also to clarify

224
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,967
not only for all of us,
but for yourself,

225
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,066
I applaud you.

226
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,600
And I think it's so courageous.

227
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,400
And you have our support, this
family here, forever, any time.

228
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,767
[light applause]

229
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,367
All right.

230
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:30,667
Moving on
to Miss Morgan McMichaels.

231
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,967
Now, I hear that you are
transitioning from being a man

232
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,066
into a butch man.

233
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,767
Is that right?

234
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:38,834
- [deep voice] Absolutely.

235
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,467
[all laugh]

236
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,567
We're going in different
directions, Sonique and I.

237
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:45,834
- Now, Morgan, you and Mystique
had your moments together.

238
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:46,834
- Did we?

239
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,633
- When?
- When?

240
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,667
- Let's take a look.

241
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,467
- Oh, here we go.

242
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,266
You have no class
and no manners.

243
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,633
- No class, no manners?

244
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,166
You piss me off some more,
I will whoop your fucking ass!

245
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,133
Bitch, I am from Chicago!

246
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,100
[laughs]

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
- Wow.

248
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,166
Morgan, that was intense.

249
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,367
- You know, at the end
of the day, I'm a man.

250
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,633
And I'm not gonna let people
disrespect me.

251
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,367
Now, everything that I said
during the fight,

252
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,266
obviously it was elevated,
and it was heated.

253
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,934
And, you know,
your makeup is your own,

254
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,333
and your hair is your own,

255
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,600
and everything that you do
to make Mystique is fabulous.

256
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,233
I think you're
an amazing entertainer.

257
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,266
- Why, thank you.

258
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,367
I love you too.

259
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,400
We should make out later.

260
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
- Ew.

261
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
- [laughs]

262
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,867
See, no, we had a heart-to-heart
since the whole fight.

263
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:29,900
- Yeah, we've spoken.

264
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
- We spoke.

265
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,033
Some people think we don't talk,

266
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,734
and we're just pissed off
at each other.

267
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,433
- People are under the illusion

268
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,266
that one fight has ended
any chance of a friendship.

269
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,734
- Are there any girls that you
haven't kept in touch with?

270
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,467
- I haven't spoken
with Tatianna.

271
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,800
Like, watching the episodes and,

272
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,967
like, watching the comments
she made about me,

273
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,767
I was not surprised.

274
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,633
I think I was more disappointed.

275
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,200
- So you found out more about
what she said

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,033
once you watched the show.

277
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,433
- Once I watched the episodes,

278
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,066
and she kept calling me a whore,

279
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,934
and I needed to be knocked off
my high horse,

280
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,066
I think it was
from her own insecurity,

281
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,300
'cause I never said a bad word
about Tatianna.

282
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,633
- Well, you'll have a chance
to speak with Tatianna

283
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,200
face-to-face,
and all the other girls,

284
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,333
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>

285
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,900
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

286
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,266
Our next doll
is a dancin' queen.

287
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,300
Welcome back, Sahara Davenport.

288
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,967
From sizzling San Juan,
it's Miss Jessica Wild.

289
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:33,934
<i>Escandalo!</i>

290
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:37,600
When this queen's in the house,
it's a barrel of laughs.

291
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,500
Give it up for Pandora Boxx!

292
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,834
This next queen's natural beauty
is undeniable.

293
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:51,800
Welcome back the ravishing
Tatianna.

294
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,867
The song you just sashayed out

295
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,900
to is the Bangkok Booty Mix
of<i> LadyBoy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

296
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,367
available on iTunes.

297
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,300
Sahara, now, during the show,

298
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,133
we found out that your mother
was a minister

299
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,734
and that your family wasn't that
supportive of your drag career.

300
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:10,166
Since the show, what's happened?

301
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,700
- One night,
I was heading out to a gig,

302
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,066
and I got a text from her:

303
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,834
"I see you on RuPaul's show,
and you look fabulous.

304
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,166
Call me."

305
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,066
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna call her,

306
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,734
and this woman is gonna cuss me
the [...] out."

307
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:22,200
- You thought
it was an intervention?

308
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,500
- Yeah, I thought
it was an intervention,

309
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,333
but I actually called her
the next morning.

310
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,066
She was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you."

311
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,800
- Would you say
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

312
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
is bringing families together?

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,166
- Christian, black families
together!

314
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,800
- All right, praise--

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu!

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,834
[laughter]

317
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,934
- What reaction
do you get from fans

318
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,734
who've watched you on the show?

319
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,300
- I get Facebooks all the time

320
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,333
from little boys who are asking
me questions like,

321
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,834
"I want to tell my mom.
I don't have the strength.

322
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,233
I don't have the courage.
Please help me."

323
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,567
And it's just like,

324
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,066
"I didn't know I was signing up
for that," you know.

325
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,133
I thought I was coming on,
you know, to--

326
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,333
to be fabulous and show
the world my talent and,

327
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,600
you know,
increase my booking fee.

328
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,367
[laughter]

329
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,600
But the show definitely
has given me a voice,

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,066
and it's taught me that,
outside of just the performance,

331
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,266
that we all have a voice
and have a responsibility

332
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,333
to not only our community,
but to the world,

333
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,066
to share and help those in need
as much as we can.

334
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,166
- That's lovely,
and you're absolutely right.

335
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,567
Thank you, Sahara.

336
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,100
Now, Jessica, you had some
issues with your English.

337
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,467
- Yes.

338
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,800
I was so scared when you called
me that I'm on the show.

339
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,066
Because I don't speak English.

340
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,533
But I think, at the same time,
"I'm not gonna quit.

341
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,867
I'm just gonna do it."

342
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,967
- Well, I think your accent
is absolutely charming.

343
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:40,166
- Sometimes I'm lost,
but I'm acting like...

344
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,700
"Oh, oh, yes.

345
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
"Oh, my God, the judges?

346
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,567
"Oh, I love it.

347
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,400
I love it."

348
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,667
- What's the wildest thing
people have written to you?

349
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:54,333
- A mom write me that her son
want to be a drag queen.

350
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,934
And her son have ten years old.

351
00:13:56,934 --> 00:14:01,600
And she said, "Now you show me
that my son is a special,

352
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,100
and I need to love him more
and more."

353
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,400
So I teach people that my mom
love me, no matter what.

354
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,133
So you need to support your
family, because we are specials.

355
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,266
- Yeah.
Thank you, Jessica.

356
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,900
- Thank you.

357
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,133
- Pandora, now,<i> Entertainment</i>
<i>Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> called your elimination</i>

358
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,500
the most controversial.

359
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,934
And at one point in the show,

360
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:25,233
I called you the Susan Lucci
of<i> Drag Race.</i>

361
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,800
You came very close
to winning challenges,

362
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,734
but you never won a challenge.

363
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:30,867
Do you hate me?

364
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,367
- I was the one
that keyed your car.

365
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,467
- Oh, it was you!

366
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,100
- Yeah.

367
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,200
I feel much better now.

368
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
- Oh, good.

369
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,233
So, Pandora, you made
a very brave admission

370
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,934
at one point in the show.

371
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,500
Let's take a look.

372
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
- I tried to kill myself.

373
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,567
- Oh, no, sir.

374
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,533
- I didn't understand.

375
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,600
I didn't know what gay was.

376
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,633
I knew I was totally different,

377
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:49,800
I felt totally alone.

378
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,900
I thought that, you know,

379
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,333
"Well, I'll just take
all these pills

380
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,834
because I don't--
I can't deal with it anymore."

381
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,734
- Now, that was very brave,
and I was very moved by that.

382
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,600
What's the reaction been?

383
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
- I've gotten many emails
from people

384
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,100
saying that they have gone
through the same thing,

385
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,533
and they've felt
the same emotion.

386
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,266
And I actually got, probably,
the most powerful email.

387
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:13,066
Somebody said,
by hearing my story,

388
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,400
that they said
that I saved their life.

389
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,500
I burst into tears.

390
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,834
I was blown away by that.

391
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,266
- It's amazing the power
that you have as queen,

392
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:22,633
and it's quite a gift.

393
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,734
I also remember that you talked
about your father,

394
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:28,300
and that he, you know, wasn't
that accepting of what you do,

395
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,066
and that he had been ill.

396
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,800
- He always accepted me being
gay, but the drag thing,

397
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,233
he just didn't want
to really acknowledge.

398
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,567
- Was there any closure there?

399
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,600
- There was a moment
before he passed away.

400
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,567
It was actually a week
before he passed away.

401
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,166
And he called me and he said
that he watched<i> Drag Race,</i>

402
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,066
and that he was so proud of me,
and he was my number one fan.

403
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,834
And that's the call...

404
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,600
[choking back tears]

405
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,433
That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.

406
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,500
- That's beautiful.

407
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,734
And so many have been waiting
for that call.

408
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,767
Do you have anything to say
about the people out there

409
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,433
who have been waiting
for that call?

410
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,133
- I would just say that know
that you're good enough,

411
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,567
and you're perfect
the way that you are.

412
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,834
And you have to affirm
your life,

413
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,066
and that's what I did before,

414
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:19,467
but it was amazing to at least
have that moment

415
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,500
before he passed away.

416
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,066
- Well, no matter what happens,

417
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,967
I mean,
you always kept us laughing,

418
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,367
and that's worth $1 billion.

419
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,800
- Can I get paid a $1 billion
for it?

420
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,133
[laughter]

421
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,066
- I love that outfit,
by the way.

422
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:37,066
It's your<i> Drag Race</i>
official dress.

423
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,333
- It is.

424
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,967
You know, I'll just go
into merchandising for it.

425
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,233
- I think it's brilliant.
Yeah.

426
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,633
- By Marco Marco.

427
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,967
Well, I came up
with the concept,

428
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,066
and then he did it for me.

429
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,266
- It's brilliant.
- Changed a few things.

430
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,633
- Yeah, it's great.

431
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,900
- It's got it all: the checkered
flag, the runway--

432
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,066
Brilliant.

433
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,400
I figure if
I couldn't win the race,

434
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,100
I'll at least win the race in
this outfit.

435
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,600
- Yes, absolutely.

436
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,100
And I'm sure Santino will have
a lot to say about that outfit.

437
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,333
- [laughs]

438
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,867
And I'm sure I won't listen
to him again.

439
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,233
[laughter]

440
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,333
- I thank you, Pandora.

441
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,500
- Thank you.

442
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
- Tatianna.

443
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
- Hey.

444
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,433
- T-A-T-I.

445
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,633
Yeah, you were one controversial
character on the show.

446
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,800
- Evidently.

447
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,133
- During the show,
you were pretty beat up

448
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,400
by the other girls.

449
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,367
- There was a few nights
that I went back to the hotel

450
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:25,100
and just cried and didn't really
want to talk about it.

451
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,767
'cause I didn't want people
to see

452
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,066
that they were getting to me.

453
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,166
- Did it affect you?

454
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,533
- It definitely affected me.

455
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,467
When I left here, I didn't want
to be around drag queens

456
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,667
for a good minute.

457
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,934
[laughter]

458
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,066
I'll say that right now.

459
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,734
I did not want to.

460
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,333
- Now, in a mini-challenge,

461
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,567
we asked you to throw shade
in front of everyone.

462
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,367
And you kind of froze up.

463
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,367
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,467
- Yet...
[laughs]

465
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,367
You weren't shy about
criticizing others

466
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,367
during your interviews.

467
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,200
- Oh, no.
- Let's take a look.

468
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,066
- Oh, boy. Shall we?

469
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,100
[laughs]

470
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,700
I am so happy
that someone said something

471
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,066
about Morgan's whoreness.

472
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,734
Sonique, she always got
that stank face.

473
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,233
Raven all of a sudden decides
that she to blossom, verbally.

474
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,600
These sparkling 30 years that
she's got behind her,

475
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,367
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.

476
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,567
She's just got to spread it.

477
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,400
- Okay.
- Hey.

478
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,834
- Do you think it's okay to say
something behind somebody's back

479
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,467
as opposed to--to their face?

480
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,066
- I didn't come in with,
like, a strategy of,

481
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,433
"Well, I'm gonna be nice,
and then I'm gonna cut 'em,

482
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:28,567
you know, behind the scenes."

483
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,066
Like, it wasn't like that.

484
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,633
I wanted to speak of others how
I would want to be spoken about.

485
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,700
When someone comes at me wrong,

486
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,300
then that rule's going out
the window,

487
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,934
and I'm talking some shit.

488
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:39,200
- When did I ever say or do
anything to you

489
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,500
to make you say something
about me?

490
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,867
Because I never was
that way to you.

491
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,934
- No one said every single thing
that they thought

492
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,066
to that person.

493
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,266
- Well, neither did you.
- No one did.

494
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,100
I know, I know,
and I'm not saying I did either.

495
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,233
- I definitely did.

496
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,633
You're a little more reserved.

497
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,834
I mean, sure, your legs--
you have great stems, honey.

498
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,166
But you know what I'm saying?

499
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,266
But I just didn't appreciate
the fact that, you know,

500
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,867
you totally slung me, like,
"Oh, she's a whore."

501
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,500
- I didn't mean literally
you are a whore.

502
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,300
- Right.
- Certainly not.

503
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,767
- So, Tatianna, the biggest
critique from the other girls

504
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:14,066
was that they felt you were
getting by on your looks.

505
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,900
Now, how did that make you feel?

506
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,266
- It kind of pissed me off.

507
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,867
- Kind of pissed you off
or really pissed you off?

508
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,867
- It really pissed me off.

509
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,166
- Tell me about it.

510
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,200
- It truly pissed me off.
I'm more than a face.

511
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,734
I have something to say.
I have thoughts.

512
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,100
- You're a great pair of legs
too.

513
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,200
- Thank you.

514
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,633
I think that you saw
that I was progressing,

515
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:30,934
and that I was growing,

516
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:33,266
and I feel like all the other
girls chopped it down to,

517
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,200
"Oh, well, she's just pretty.
She's just Rebecca."

518
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,433
And I'm like,
"No, I'm more than that."

519
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:41,667
Just because I have a more of
a realistic type look sometimes

520
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,834
doesn't mean that I'm any less
of a queen than anyone else.

521
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,266
As long as I have a dick between
my legs and a wig on my head,

522
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,333
I'm a drag queen.

523
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,133
- Dressed.
- Point-blank, period.

524
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,533
And that is the way that it is.

525
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,934
- The criteria gets down
to the charisma,

526
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,633
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

527
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:00,500
And you really can't even
compare all of you, you know?

528
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,100
You're all winners.
You're all winners.

529
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,700
Coming up, we'll be joined by

530
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,433
Raven, Jujubee,

531
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:10,266
and America's Next Drag
Superstar, Tyra Sanchez.

532
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,233
The new Tyra.

533
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:15,033
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

534
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:18,066
Let's welcome back the Laotian
in the house,

535
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:21,433
the incomparable Miss Jujubee!

536
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,233
Early in the competition,

537
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:36,233
this next queen almost sashayed
away, twice.

538
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,333
But she dug deep,
stepped up her game,

539
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,500
and ended up in the top two.

540
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,300
That is so Raven.

541
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,367
This last doll always
stole the show.

542
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,767
And some of these queens
want it back.

543
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,967
America's next drag superstar,

544
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,834
Miss Tyra Sanchez!

545
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,900
[applause]

546
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,066
Tyra!

547
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:14,934
- Hey.

548
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:17,200
- My queen.
Mwah. Mwah.

549
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Gorgeous.

550
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,233
- Thank you.

551
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:21,700
- Have a seat, darling.

552
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,300
You're all here.
How 'bout that?

553
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Look around you.

554
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,567
These are your sisters.

555
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:30,667
Win or lose, love or hate,
we are family.

556
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,900
[shaky voice]
And I am your mother.

557
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,867
- Oh.
- Mommy.

558
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,100
- Jujubee.

559
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
- Hi.

560
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,100
- You talked a little in the
show about being a gay Asian.

561
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,667
Have all the Gasians out there
contacted you?

562
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,667
- Yes.
- What have they said?

563
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,200
- They--they say
that it's an inspiring feat

564
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,567
for me to be on television

565
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:53,433
and talk about my culture
and actually speak Laotian.

566
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,400
And, you know,
my family's really happy.

567
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,867
I'm very excited.

568
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,734
- Have you talked to your mom?
- I have not.

569
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,133
- Now, if your mom
is watching this,

570
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,166
is there anything
you'd like to say to her?

571
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,867
- Thank you for giving me life.

572
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,066
You know, I mean, that's...

573
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,633
That's really
what I have right now.

574
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,900
It's--it's been ten years, but
I need a little bit--I need--

575
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,567
I need a little bit more time.

576
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:13,667
- Another ten years?

577
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,367
- No, I wouldn't--I don't know.

578
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,133
I-I feel bad, and I feel
for her, but I'm not ready.

579
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,533
Maybe Jujubee's gonna help bring
that out,

580
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,333
but it's just
a struggle for me still.

581
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,367
- So you didn't become
America's Next Drag Superstar.

582
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,400
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,767
- What is next for you?

584
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,667
- I'm still gonna
keep doing drag.

585
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,734
I mean, I wanna be in movies.

586
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,066
I wanna be onstage.

587
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,967
I wanna--I wanna play Angel
on Broadway in<i> Rent.</i>

588
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,100
I wanna do it all.

589
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,133
- I think that's gonna happen
for you.

590
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,767
The opportunity has opened up
for each of you.

591
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:46,066
The fact that you made it
into this competition...

592
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:49,200
eh, uh...
just under 300 years old.

593
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,233
I know some things, and the fact
that this happened--

594
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,433
don't take it for granted,
ladies.

595
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,500
The world is yours, but it
depends on what you put into it.

596
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,266
- I agree.

597
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,567
- Now, Raven, you were
in the bottom two twice.

598
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:02,567
- Mm-hmm.

599
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,066
- And you ended up number two.

600
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,600
How'd you pull that off?

601
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,533
- I knew when I fucked up.

602
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:12,533
Like, I knew when I did a bad
job, and I owned up to it.

603
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:16,266
My chicken was the most horrible
chicken in the fucking world.

604
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:17,467
Welcome to another...

605
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,834
Oh, shit.

606
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,467
- So your chicken was funky.

607
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,066
- Really funky, girl.

608
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:25,200
I was so focused on having,

609
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,066
like, a Southern accent...

610
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,166
So then I see that Jessica
was doing a chicken voice,

611
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm like,
"I'm such a fucking airhead."

612
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,934
Why wouldn't I do
a chicken voice?

613
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:38,066
- Now, Raven, you were not shy
during the competition,

614
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:41,433
and you were liberal
in speaking your mind.

615
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,066
Let's take a look.

616
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,500
- Nicole's gone.

617
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,967
Praise the Lord.

618
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,533
She has acrylic toenails...

619
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:52,300
with white French tips.

620
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,266
Tatianna's an airhead.

621
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,633
All she's been doing the past
couple weeks is...this.

622
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:01,266
Tatianna is about face value.

623
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:05,467
So fuck you, Tatianna.

624
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,867
- Fuck you, too, bitch.

625
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:07,900
- Mwah.

626
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,533
- Let me put it out there
real quick.

627
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,633
- Tatianna, how do you feel
about hearing all that?

628
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:12,800
- Um...

629
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,667
I think my feelings
are easily explained.

630
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,734
You're jealous.

631
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,667
You're insecure.

632
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,467
No one that feels that great
about themselves

633
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,967
has to put others down
the way that you do.

634
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:28,166
I have had very negative
feelings towards you

635
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,300
since the end of that show.

636
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,133
Now, I know that
I said some shit.

637
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:37,700
But really, though, how do you
say something like what you said

638
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
to people--like Nicole.

639
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,700
I think Nicole genuinely
thought she made a friend.

640
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,633
- We were not talking about
Nicole and I right now.

641
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,066
We were talking
about you and me.

642
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,633
- Okay, well,
then let me get back to it.

643
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:47,734
- But, I mean, that is a fact.

644
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,300
I really did think
I found a friend.

645
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,266
I was gagged by that.

646
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:51,734
- Until the point--
- Okay--

647
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,700
- I'm not done talking yet.
You will speak when I'm done.

648
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,767
- Ooh.
- Honey.

649
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,233
- Security.

650
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,867
- She has gotten everything that
she wanted to say out about me.

651
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,200
It's my turn.

652
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,700
And I never said anything
hurtful about you.

653
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,066
I said that you run your mouth,
'cause you do.

654
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:08,867
But I didn't, like--I didn't
go for, "Oh, she's fat.

655
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:09,934
"Oh, she's an airhead.

656
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,433
"She's dumb, she's nothing.

657
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,934
They're living for someone
that's nothing."

658
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:14,200
Bullshit.

659
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,834
- When my opinion was asked for,
is when I gave it.

660
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,100
- When you were in an interview?

661
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,800
- When I went into the
interview, they would say,

662
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,867
"What do you think about this?

663
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,066
What do you think about that?"

664
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,633
Here's my opinion.

665
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:26,100
So if it came off and sounded
shitty,

666
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,400
sorry that it sounded shitty.

667
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,300
- No, you're not.
Don't give empty apologies.

668
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,500
You're not sorry for shit.
- Okay, well, then I'm done.

669
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,166
- 'Cause I haven't heard
from you.

670
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,867
The only thing I've heard from
you was, "You're gorgeous."

671
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,500
And then another message,
"You're gorgeous."

672
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,567
- 'Cause you are gorgeous,

673
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,633
and I've told you that
since day one.

674
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,467
You, out of everyone in this
competition,

675
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,467
has the most beautiful face
in this competition.

676
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,667
- I'm more than a face.

677
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,667
- It's just malicious,
just gay faggotry

678
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,333
that I just was not thinking
we were gonna run into here.

679
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,433
- Well, guess what.
We are making a TV show.

680
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:54,667
So don't sit here and act like

681
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,300
we were filming an episode
of<i> 7th Heaven.</i>

682
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,367
- I didn't say that.

683
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,834
- It's a fucking drag
competition.

684
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,166
- Yeah, I know, but, I mean,

685
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,066
but they were all smiling
in my face at one point.

686
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:04,333
- I never smiled in your face,
and I never hung out with you.

687
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,600
So you can sit there and say

688
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,533
that we were cool
and we hung out--we never did.

689
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,633
Every one of you, even Morgan,
can sit here and say,

690
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:10,633
"You're a fucking bitch."

691
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,066
I don't care.

692
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,066
- That's evident.

693
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,200
It's very evident.

694
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,667
That's the problem.
That is your problem.

695
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,200
Your personality is for shit.
- It's not a problem actually.

696
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,100
- You are the one
that is face value.

697
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
Your outside is gorgeous, Raven,

698
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,767
but your insides are dark and
nasty, and I don't like you.

699
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,367
- You were pretty bitchy
yourself, so there.

700
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,467
- I wasn't that bad.
I was not like you.

701
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,233
I wasn't like you.
Let's be clear.

702
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,600
The people I spoke shit about,

703
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,567
I'm sorry, at the point in time,
they deserved it,

704
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:35,767
and I was mad.

705
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,700
But I didn't deserve
what you said about me.

706
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,800
I didn't deserve it
and neither did anyone else.

707
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,633
- So you going, "Oh, I pity you
for the face you have,"

708
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,667
that's not the same thing?

709
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,066
- There's a difference.

710
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:48,066
I'm sorry, but there's a
blatant, obvious difference.

711
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,333
- I know Raven really well,

712
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,967
and Raven's a beautiful fucking
person.

713
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,200
I know you really well,

714
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,066
and I know you're a fucking
beautiful person.

715
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,066
You guys have such
the same traits

716
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,867
that it doesn't work.

717
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,266
Do you know what I'm saying?

718
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:02,834
And I hate--and I hate--
and I hate to say that to you

719
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,600
and to you, because I know you
don't like that,

720
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,834
but there's a lot
of similarities.

721
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,767
So live with it or just don't
talk to each other.

722
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:11,734
- And I will say,
on my last night--

723
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:12,800
or my last day there,

724
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,433
I had a conversation with you,

725
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,500
and I said, "You know what,

726
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,834
"we do have things in common.

727
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:19,100
I don't understand why you hate
me so much."

728
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,066
And it's almost like you look at
me, and you see--

729
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,266
- Well, I don't hate you.

730
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,333
I don't hate you, Tatianna.

731
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,767
- The things that you say,
I can't fathom--

732
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,166
not hating someone,

733
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,800
but then feeling justified

734
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,200
and not wanting to apologize
for the things that you said.

735
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,533
- If it hurt your feelings,

736
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,900
okay, then I am sorry
that it hurt your feelings.

737
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,667
I am not sorry for saying it.

738
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,233
Okay?
- Okay.

739
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,066
- Now, we are overly sensitive.

740
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,166
But your feelings are not facts.

741
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,633
And I said this to the first
season,

742
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:47,266
because they got their panties
in a bunch

743
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,100
over things that are said.

744
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,400
Listen, kiddo,
things are gonna be said.

745
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,667
And you're all highly
intelligent,

746
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,233
you're all highly sensitive.

747
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:59,166
You have to not let it
hurt your feelings.

748
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,233
Raven is a little more seasoned.

749
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:04,800
So her skin is a little bit
thicker, basically.

750
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,834
- It's weathered.

751
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,166
- It's--[laughs]

752
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,967
Raven, you're under a lot
of heat right now,

753
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:12,767
but you've also made millions
and millions of fans.

754
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,800
Would you have done anything
differently?

755
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,900
- I wouldn't have said a lot of
things that I did or said them

756
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,066
the way that I did.

757
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,467
I realize I don't speak
eloquently.

758
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,066
I'm not a lady.

759
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,567
- Oh, no, I think you speak
very eloquently.

760
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:26,800
- Well, thank you.

761
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,867
But I--you know, and I have
the mouth of a trucker.

762
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,266
So I'm like--I guess you could
say I'm an eloquent trucker.

763
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,934
[laughter]

764
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:38,700
I would have worded things
a lot softer.

765
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,734
Because like Pandora said in one
of the<i> Untuckeds,</i>

766
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:44,266
that the next drag superstar
needs to be

767
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,767
basically not such
a wretched cunt.

768
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:46,900
- [laughs]

769
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,567
- So I would have worded things
differently.

770
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:49,767
- Really?
- Yep.

771
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,667
- Now, Tatianna,
Raven apologized,

772
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,734
but you still seem
to be holding onto it.

773
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,800
Why is that?

774
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,367
- 'Cause, you know,
I am sensitive.

775
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,567
And the things that she said
did bother me.

776
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:05,066
And when I came here I, "A," had
no friends in the drag world.

777
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:08,567
I had also never traveled
by myself before.

778
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,834
I'd never been on a plane
by myself before.

779
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,633
I had never been
away from my family

780
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,600
as long as I was by myself.

781
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,433
So I think it just--

782
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,333
you think of someone
in your head a certain way,

783
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,567
and when you watch it,
it's completely different,

784
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:22,600
it kind of--it hurts.

785
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,066
- Yeah.

786
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:29,200
- And I should not have been as
vocal as I was about Tatianna,

787
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,133
about you, again,

788
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,667
and I'm gonna speak to you.

789
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,300
I apologize.

790
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,667
- So, kids, this is the perfect
time for a little hug.

791
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,900
- For your mother.
- For your mother.

792
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,133
- Aw.

793
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,467
Well, Tatianna, Raven,
I hope you feel better.

794
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,800
I know I do.

795
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:54,567
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

796
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,433
Tyra Sanchez.

797
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:57,433
- Hi.

798
00:29:57,433 --> 00:30:00,133
- America's Next Drag Superstar.

799
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,533
Now, some people probably think
this is a controversial decision

800
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:06,100
to have you as
the Next Drag Superstar.

801
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,333
Of all the girls, you received
some of the harshest criticisms

802
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,266
from the other competitors.

803
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:16,700
Expressions like
"lazy bitch,"

804
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,100
"immature,"

805
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,333
"mannerless."

806
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,667
- "Satan's baby."
- "Satan's baby."

807
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,934
How's that make you feel?

808
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:30,834
- When I watched it, I realized
that, at the time,

809
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,100
I was all those things that they
were calling me.

810
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,300
All I can do is, like, apologize
to Sahara and to Tatianna,

811
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,166
all the girls, Jujubee, whoever.

812
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,300
If I hurt your feelings,

813
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,900
if I did anything to,
like, make you upset,

814
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,900
like Pandora, or anyone else,
I can only apologize.

815
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,633
I can't take back what I did.

816
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:53,467
But I can only make
from this day forward better.

817
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:56,367
- Well, you know, a lot of
people who have written in

818
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,633
have very strong feelings
about you.

819
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,200
You know,
they acknowledge the fact

820
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,400
that you are a fierce queen,

821
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,600
but your behavior on the show
turned them off.

822
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,066
Is there anything you want
to say to them?

823
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,066
- And all I could ask is that

824
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,333
for them to reach out
and pray for me,

825
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,066
pray for me and pray for my son,

826
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,400
like, for us
to have a better life

827
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,934
and to be better people
within ourselves.

828
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,700
- Um, coming back here,
you know,

829
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,500
you get to reconnect with people
you haven't seen in a while,

830
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,266
and I saw a complete change
in Tyra.

831
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,066
She's completely not the--

832
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:30,066
not the same Tyra
that I fought with.

833
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:31,433
She's not that Tyra anymore.

834
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,567
- What's changed?

835
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,934
- Just the general demeanor.

836
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,533
It just seems like she's
a lot more like, "Hello."

837
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:40,133
It looks like she wants
to try and integrate.

838
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,367
I didn't get that on the show.

839
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,100
It would be everyone hanging out

840
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,367
and then Tyra separating herself
to a certain extent.

841
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,767
- I think she was just
so focused on a goal,

842
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,233
and that she didn't want to come
and hang out with everyone

843
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,367
because then she would end up
not being focused

844
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,600
on the next day's challenge

845
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,700
and could possibly end up
in the bottom two.

846
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,166
- Is that true, Tyra?

847
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,300
- Before I came here,
I didn't have a place to stay.

848
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,133
I was sleeping
on my drag mother's floor.

849
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,433
I didn't have a job.

850
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,400
When I came here,
my goal was to win.

851
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,166
If I went home empty-handed,
like, that wasn't an option.

852
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,066
But my mom, like,
she always teached me,

853
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,367
when you want something,
you pray for it.

854
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:18,567
And so I stayed prayed up.

855
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,133
That's what I call it,
I prayed up.

856
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:22,967
When I went into the hotel,
I didn't want to hang out.

857
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:26,467
I stayed in my room and, like,
I would ask God for ideas,

858
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,133
creations for the next
challenge, or what to do on,

859
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,633
like, on the runway.

860
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:33,233
Give me the idea that I need
to win this challenge.

861
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:34,600
- She's young.

862
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,834
She have the opportunity
to change, and I think she did.

863
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:40,500
And I just want to say
that I'm so proud of you.

864
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,066
And I feel great that you are
the Next Drag Superstar,

865
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:45,066
because you have
a lot of talent.

866
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,200
A lot of people love you,

867
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,333
and we are going to support you
in your career.

868
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,934
- I'm a fan, I really am.

869
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,934
Like, watching the show,
you can't take it from her.

870
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,133
Watching the show I'm like,
"The bitch turned it."

871
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:59,567
- Well, listen, I think that
your prayers were answered,

872
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,734
and I think that people
will pray for you

873
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:05,633
and your success as America's
Next Drag Superstar.

874
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:09,333
I have to say, you came here
with a drag mother

875
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,066
who clearly taught you
the rules of drag.

876
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,066
In the wedding challenge,

877
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,567
you come out on your knees

878
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,066
behind the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen.

879
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,066
You peekaboo around it,

880
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,667
throw the flowers in the air,

881
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,700
and jump up
without support on your feet.

882
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,200
And when I called you out
after your runway presentation,

883
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,066
you had tears in your eyes.

884
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:37,967
And you pulled the veil
over your face back

885
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:40,200
in the back of the room.

886
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,800
Bitch, your pussy was on fire.

887
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,633
That shit was fierce.

888
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,967
Now, I'm--I told you,
I'm just under 300 years old.

889
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,734
Seen a lot of queens.

890
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:55,333
That kind of behavior
that you had clearly learned

891
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,066
from another elderly queen
such as I,

892
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,867
that's magic.

893
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:05,233
That's magic shit
right there.

894
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:06,700
- Thank you.

895
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,133
- Now, Tyra, how do you think

896
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,867
winning the crown will
change your life?

897
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,600
- This is opening so many doors
for me, and not only me,

898
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,066
for my son, just to make
his life better

899
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:18,967
and to give him the things
that I didn't have.

900
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,767
I actually got custody of him,

901
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,333
so now, this month, he's gonna
be staying with me

902
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,066
from this point on.

903
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:29,200
And I just, like, have everyone
helping me out in so many ways.

904
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
- Tyra, I just have to ask you.

905
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,834
Aside from your beautiful,
bejeweled bosom,

906
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:38,066
is there a secret
to your smile?

907
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,934
- Yes, I got a new smile,

908
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:44,533
not because of the reading
that we had.

909
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:49,233
- Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue canceled?

910
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:52,633
Your grill is fucked up.
- Oop!

911
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,967
- The barbecue is back, honey.

912
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,834
- The barbecue is back on.

913
00:34:56,834 --> 00:35:00,133
And not because of what people
were saying on the Internet.

914
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,200
I did it for myself.

915
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,166
Got it fixed,
got it straightened.

916
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,800
I even got my voice deepened.

917
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,300
[laughter]

918
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,533
- Can they do that?

919
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:08,567
- They can do that.

920
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,100
It goes deeper and deeper
every day.

921
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,800
[laughter]

922
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,700
- All right, coming up,
the girls get their chance

923
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,867
to judge the judges
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

924
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,467
keeps on keeping on.

925
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,834
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

926
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,367
Now, drag queens are always
getting judged.

927
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:36,166
Every once in a while,
it's nice to give a little back.

928
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:39,400
So, girls, sharpen your claws

929
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,700
for two of my favorite people
in the world.

930
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,600
Please welcome back our resident
biological woman,

931
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Merle Ginsberg,

932
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,433
and the always fashionable
Santino Rice.

933
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:54,467
Now, the two of you
are L.A. party people.

934
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:59,300
Who out there surprised you
that were fans of the show?

935
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,400
- I did a little job
interviewing people

936
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,700
on a red carpet,

937
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,900
and I had to interview Johnny
Weir, the great skater,

938
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,100
and I'm so excited to meet
Johnny Weir.

939
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,834
And I put out my hand, he goes,

940
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,700
"Oh, I love you.
I love<i> Drag Race."</i>

941
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,066
I was like, "I can't even
believe this is happening."

942
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:16,066
- Now, Merle,
this season on our show,

943
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:19,066
what stood out fashion-wise?

944
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:22,066
- Well, Tyra's looks
just blew me away.

945
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,133
They really did.

946
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:26,967
They were so Paris runway,
Christian Dior.

947
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:30,433
And I just kept wondering,
how the hell did she do that?

948
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,633
- When you are
in a situation like this

949
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,800
and the whole world is watching,

950
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,667
yeah, you hot glue things
to your body,

951
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,533
you super glue earrings
to your ears.

952
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,934
You see where people's
dedication and passion is

953
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,800
and how bad you want this.

954
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,734
- You chop off those toes
to fit in those shoes.

955
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:49,900
- Yeah.

956
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,300
- Now, Santino, you saved
your harshest criticism

957
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,834
for Pandora Boxx.

958
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,767
Tell me this, Pandora,
how did it feel

959
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,567
when you were being critiqued
on the runway?

960
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,133
- It was horrible.

961
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:04,233
It's hard to be up there getting
critiqued, and it did affect me.

962
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,600
And by the wedding challenge,

963
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,633
that's really where I kind
of--I had a breakdown.

964
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,066
I had a breakdown in my room,

965
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:11,700
because I just went in there and
just cried because I was like,

966
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,367
"I don't know what to do.

967
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,800
"I feel like I'm listening.

968
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,533
"I feel like I'm trying
to do what--

969
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:20,066
the best I can and to take
everybody's critiques

970
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,066
and do it."

971
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,567
But when you're told that,

972
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:23,767
"I don't like your style,"

973
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,700
I kind of didn't know
where to go from there.

974
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,066
- All I could say is, Pandora,

975
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,667
do you feel like,
out of all these queens,

976
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,467
you have the best personal style

977
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:36,700
and you were the most
fashionable every challenge?

978
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,400
- Um, I definitely don't feel
that I was,

979
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,734
but that's not
my strongest suit.

980
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:42,767
- Sure.

981
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,200
- But, you know,
I can hire a stylist.

982
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,700
And some of these girls
in the competition

983
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,967
needed a personality lift,
and you can't get one of those.

984
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,967
- You're right.
You're absolutely right.

985
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,133
And seeing you today, Pandora,

986
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,500
I think you look amazing.

987
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,200
I think what you're wearing
is funny, it's young.

988
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
You look stylish, hip,

989
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,767
but there were times
where you came out,

990
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:07,400
and it seemed like it was kind
of a rehabbed pageant gown

991
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,700
or something that wasn't quite

992
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,433
up to your personality
and your comedic timing.

993
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,500
- It's about knowing thyself

994
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
and presenting that
on the stage,

995
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,300
and you can never go wrong.

996
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,333
- The biggest thing I learned
is not to second-guess myself.

997
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,066
Because every outfit that got
a really harsh critique,

998
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,967
there was another one that I was
gonna wear instead and I said,

999
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,100
"Wear that other one."

1000
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,400
and I changed my mind
at the last minute

1001
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,834
and just kept what I had on.

1002
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,400
So I wish I would have listened
to my inner voice that said

1003
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,533
that, you know, "You need to--

1004
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,133
You need to wear
the better outfit."

1005
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:37,800
- What do you have to say about
Santino's outfit tonight?

1006
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,400
- [laughs]

1007
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,834
- I love homeless chic.

1008
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:41,834
I think it looks great.

1009
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,300
[laughter]

1010
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,900
- You know what, let's all
together, all the contestants,

1011
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,400
let out a primal yell directed

1012
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,533
towards the judges' panel
over here.

1013
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,800
Just yell it out.

1014
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,333
One, two, three.

1015
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,567
[all yelling]

1016
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,967
- [laughs]

1017
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:04,066
Merle, Santino, thank you
so much for coming back.

1018
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,433
Now when we return,
the viewers have voted,

1019
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:10,400
and I will announce your choice
for the fabulous

1020
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,533
Las Vegas Miss Congeniality

1021
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:15,934
and the final lip-synch
for your life.

1022
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,700
So don't fuck it up.

1023
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,900
Stay tuned.

1024
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,600
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>

1025
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,900
Well, my dolls, it's been
a wild, magic carpet ride.

1026
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Thanks for taking drag out
of the closet

1027
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,200
and into the hearts of America.

1028
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,767
Once again, all hail the queen,
Miss Tyra Sanchez,

1029
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,967
America's Next Drag Superstar.

1030
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,900

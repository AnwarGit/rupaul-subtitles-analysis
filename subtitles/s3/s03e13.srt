- Have a rubber catch

Oh, there's a message.

52
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,900
- Good-bye again.

Best of luck to everyone.

54
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,066
Turn it out and don't be

55
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,967
a sprepper.

56
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:21,900
- Don't be a sprepper.

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,967
Sprepper is this combination

58
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,233
of Sprite and Dr. Pepper.

59
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,066
It's sweet, but it's not
delicious.

60
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,867
- Raja, it's your turn.

61
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,233
- I've never done this before.

62
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,100
You guys have all done this
before I have.

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,233
Oh, BGB, girl.

64
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:37,200

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,867
I'll give ya a call.

67
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,333
I lost my cherry to being the
bottom two.

<i>- Finally, people.</i>

69
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:45,867

00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,633
- I did a little bit.

71
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,600
I thought I was gonna go home

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,767
because of some guy that I'd

73
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,066

<i>It was almost me.</i>

76
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,200
My only game plan at this point

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,367
is just to kick everyone's

78
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,066
asses, and I'm so close.

79
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,367

minutes to pitch one product,

112
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,433
own drag, and the one queen

113
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,567
who convinces me to order

114
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,400
her product will win.

115
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,400
You've got 20 minutes to put

116

spokesqueen look.

00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,166
All right.

Ah!

<i>a clue.</i>

124
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,500
- The first thing I thought of
was you're not my tucker.

125
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,967
It's fresh out of my own drag.

126
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,066
It's something that I rely on
most often,

127
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,667
and why not sell it?

128
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,066
- I don't know if I look good in
brown hair, but...

129
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,533

Be right back. My gaff.

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,500
You take this part that would
normally cover your genitals,

and you stretch it over your
face, and it has invigorating

powers that immediately wakes
you up.

138

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,900

can own this--Raja's gaff.

140

- Hi, America. I'm Yara Sofia.

It's kind of hard to find

your body.

166
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,800
You know, we are drag queens.

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,433
You can use the pop-it-on

00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,200
for your ass Alexis.

186
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
The booty, the pads, everything

187
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,066
that you need to be a complete

188
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,333
drag queen for only two payments

189
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,900
of $19.95.

190
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,066
This is Alexis Mateo for RuVC.

191
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,133
- Hi.

192
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,300
all: Hi!

193
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,400
- Wow, wow. Ooh!

194
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,066
What do we have here?

195
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,633
Let's see what I ordered.

196
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,100
This is always so exciting.

197
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,333
- Yeah!

198
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,333
- Open it, open it, open it.

199
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,200
all: [cheer, applaud]

200
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,900
- It's a pop-it-on!

201
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,266
- A pop-it-on!

202
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,500
[laughs]

203
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,233
Say what, the pop-it-on!

204
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,467
Ah, she bought the pop-it-on!

205
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,934
Finally I--I win the mini
challenge.

206
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,767
- Yara, your prize for winning

207
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,767
the mini challenge is...

208
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,433
$1 million.

209
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,867
- What?

210
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,967
Gee! Whoo!

211
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,467
- Well, well, actually,

212
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,333
darling, it's 1 million Ru
dollars.

213
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,433
- Oh!

214
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,500
- Yes.

215
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,867
- What happened?

216
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,700
- Now, the pit crew was up

217
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,800
all night cooking up this dough

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,767
at Cat Print.

219
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,066
While these may not pay your

220
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,834
bills, they could come in handy

221
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,900
a little later, because it is

222
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,066
time for the most expensive

223
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,066
challenge in<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

224
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,700
her-story!

225
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,233
This week we are throwing

226
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,100
a make-dat-money ball,

227
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
and each of you will have to

228
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,367
come up with a portfolio

229
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,867
of three different looks

230
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,400
that you could take to the bank,

231
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,233
honey.

232
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:49,066
First category--Swimsuit Body
Beautiful.

233
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,734
You need to create a bathing

234
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,834
suit hot enough to attract

235
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,967
a billionaire.

236
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:59,300
Second category--
Cocktail Attire After 5:00.

237
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,233
You need to create a flirty,

238
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,133
short dress where all that

239
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,066
glitters is gold.

240
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:10,333
Third category--Evening Gown
Eleganza.

241
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,667
- Work.

242
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:16,500
- Using 2 1/2 million Ru paper
dollars,

243
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,567
you need to create a dress that
literally screams money.

244
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:26,533
Yara, because you won the mini
challenge,

245
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,300
you have an extra million

246
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,967
dollars to play with.

247
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,133
Gentlemen, start your engines.

248
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,667
And may the best woman win.

249
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
- We have three challenges

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,633
in a row that have multiple

251
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,934
looks for the runway.

252
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,266
Like, are you exhausted?

253
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,333
'Cause I'm exhausted.

254
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,667
- I feel like I'm a glamorous

255
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,266
sweatshop worker, if you will.

256
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,667
- That's just 'cause you're
Asian.

257
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,367
- [laughs]

258
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,867
- [sighs] Have you ever made a
swimsuit before?

259
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,900
- No, I haven't--
I've never made one.

260
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,066
- What're you gonna do
for a swimsuit?

261
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,367
- A gold swimsuit.

262
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,633
All I hear from the judges

263
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,734
all the time is that my body's

264
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:04,567
not right, that my walk is not

265
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,233
right, that my hair is not
right.

266
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,967
<i>I cannot please all the judges,</i>

267
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>but that doesn't define</i>

268
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,367
<i>who I am.</i>

269
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:14,433
I mean, there's nothing wrong

270
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,900
with my body at all.

271
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Probably something wrong with

272
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,433
Michelle's and Santino's body,

273
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,900
but it's not--nothing wrong

274
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,967
with my body.

275
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,333
I'm just the girl that wears

276
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,033
the pads and the titties

277
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,300
in the show.

278
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,333
- Alexis mentions her

279
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,600
insecurity coming in,

280
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,033
and it's all in her head,
I think.

281
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,967
- But they're not, like,
sleeping on you, Alexis.

282
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,166
Like, they love you.

283
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,400
You have a great personality.

284
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,767
- It's just bullshit.

285
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,100
I don't know.

286
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,934
It doesn't make any sense to me.

287
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,066
- Why are you saying that

288
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,934
the judges are against you?

289
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,700
You have win three challenges,
girl.

290
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
- Now because of that,

291
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,734
I'm gonna get all fucked up.

292
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,734
- Fuck glue gun.

293
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,100
- Did you burn yourself?

294
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
- Fuck, fuck.

295
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,734
- Today's main challenge

296
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,700
is to make three distinct

297
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,567
money looks--uh, a swimsuit,

298
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,066
a cocktail dress, and an evening

299
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:13,567
gown--for Ru's make-dat-money
ball.

300
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,900
- Where's the only
fucking glue gun?

301
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,100
- We're stressed out, 'cause

302
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,467
it's gonna be a long day, honey.

303
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,100
- Some craziness.

304
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,467
<i>I know there's a lot of people</i>

305
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,633
<i>that think that I'm gonna do</i>

306
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,934
<i>wrong in this challenge.</i>

307
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,166
I don't have a clue

308
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,667
how this is gonna turn out.

309
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,800
I have never worked with this

310
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,066
kind of material, and every time

311
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,834
I try hard, I get shit.

312
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,233
- Girl! That--oh, maybe you

313
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,667
wanna start over.
- Um, I hate it.

314
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,834
I think we're all in a great
panic at this point.

315
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,333
There's very, very little time,

316
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,567
and I can feel the stress

317
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,533
in the room.

318
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,367
Oh, I hate starting over.

319
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,400
I can't stand this anymore.

320
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,066
- Hello, hello, hello!

321
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,200
-<i> Hola!</i>

322
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,367
- Are you ready for the

323
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,934
make-dat-money ball?

324
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,133
- Yes.

325
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,433
- Not yet.

326
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,834
- Hi, Alexis.

327
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:11,767
- Hi, Ru!

328
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,133
- Does this challenge frighten

329
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,133
you at all?

330
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,467
- Yeah, I am worried about it.

331
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,900
Like, it's so difficult.

332
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,066
I'm not a pro.

333
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,166
I'm not a designer.

334
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,433
- Okay, all right.

335
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,233
So, are you gonna do a whole

336
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,633
gold storyline here?

337
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,667
- You know what, Ru,

338
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,800
I have no clue what I want

339
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
to show on the stage.

340
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,300
<i>I'm talking to Ru,</i>

341
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,433
<i>and it was not going well.</i>

342
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,333
That scares me a lot.

343
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,867
- Who's your biggest
competition?

344
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,767
- It is Yara.

345
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,266
Yara have everything that I love

346
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,467
in a drag queen.

347
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,500
Her mind is very high-fashion,

348
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,166
and her personality is so,

349
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,633
so big.

350
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,066
Plus she's Puerto Rican.

351
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,934
- Uh-huh.

352
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:48,834
- So, if I don't win this

353
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,900
competition, another

354
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,066
Puerto Rican should be crowned.

355
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,066
- [laughs]

356
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,266
All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru!

357
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:56,633
- All right.

358
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,233
Yara Sofia.

359
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,266
- Hi!

360
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,600
- Tell me about money.

361
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,667
Are you free-spending,

362
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,800
or are you very frugal?

363
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,066
- I'm very free-spending.

364
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,500
- [laughs]

365
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,934
- I'm broke, but I'm still

366
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,600
fabulous.

367
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,467
- If you win the $75,000,

368
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,266
are you just gonna spend it?

369
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,233
- I am gonna move probably

370
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,066
to the states.

371
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:20,266
Puerto Rico, it's hard to find a
job.

372
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,066
- It's hard to find a job here
too.

373
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,066
- Yes, I know, but it--

374
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,166
in Puerto Rico, it's more hard.

375
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,133
- Do you make a living

376
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,333
making dresses?

377
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,400
- Yes. My inspiration
is Bob Mackie.

378
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,633
- You could be the next
Bob Mackie.

379
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:32,867
We need another Bob Mackie.

380
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,300
We need more wearable art.

381
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,367
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,166
I want to risk the American
dream.

383

And that's why I'm here, I'm--

386
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,467

396
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,967
- Well, no, I knew that, like,

397
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,400
I was gonna be in for the long
haul.

398
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,500

401
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,233
- So, is it safe to say you

402
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:11,467
didn't come to the competition

403
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,500

404
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,600

405
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,266
- Uh, well, both.

406
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,600
I love meeting new people,

407
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,734
so I'm gonna make a lot of

408
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,266
friends, but if I have to stab

409
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,300
them in the back, I mean,
whatever.

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,734

411
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,500
Well, hello, Raja.

412
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,533
- Hi, sexy lady.

413
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,567
- What are you working on now?

414
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,800
- Well, I'm basically making

415
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,266

Do you have enough time

419
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,433
to do something like that?

420
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,533
- I think so.

421
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,200
- All right. Now, tell me

422
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
something about the swimsuit.

423
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,433
- I wanna show my skinny body

424
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,500
and do just a bikini.

425
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,066
- How do you stay so skinny?

426
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,200
- I work out. I do Pilates and
yoga.

427
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,166
And with my, uh, $75,000 that

00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,433
choreography between Alexis

554
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,433
and me, 'cause we have a great

555
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,400
connection and Alexis is

556
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,667
a good dancer.

557
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,734
- Here we go.

558
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,767
- Whoo! The coins!

559
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,333
- Get your coins, girl.

560
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,000
- Um, let's begin.

561
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,066
- What are we gonna do?

562
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,367
- Manila seems a little bit
terrified,

563
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,567
but so am I, so we're in this
together.

564
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,533
- First step.

565
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,767
Step with the right...

566
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,166
Shoulder, out.

567
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,367
Boom, bam.

568
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,367
Five, six, seven, eight, we do
this in line.

569
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,467
And we get out of the line.

570
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:01,233
We go back in line,
and we gonna repeat that again.

571
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,900
- Perfect.
- Whoo! Okay.

572
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,433
- Good job, darling.

573
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:08,200
Outsides all yours.
I told you, she's good.

574
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,533
- Here we go! And step.

575
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:13,900
Again, we got it, we got it, we
got it.

576
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,767
- I'm lost, I'm so lost.

577
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,066
Oh, what happened?

578
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,867
Oh, wait, what am I doing?

579
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,800
- Wait a minute.
[laughs]

580
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,100
- Wait, sorry.

581
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,266
What am I doing? Am I following
you?

582
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,333
I'm doing the opposite of you
now, right?

583
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,300
- [laughs]
- I'm still doing that?

584
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,834
I haven't done a choreographed
routine in such a long time.

585
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm terrified.

586
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,166
- It's easy.

587
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,600
- Once I get this, you guys
better watch out.

588
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,700
- Okay.

589
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,100
- Oh, girl, you're gonna have to
catch up,

590
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,266
because it's not that difficult

591
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,100
to understand, so get it

592
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,233
together, bitch.

593
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,066
Hands up.

594
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,166
Then we going to the left,
to the right,

595
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,834
and go all the way to your ass.

596
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:53,367
Shakin' my ass.
- Yeah, darling!

597
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,300
- Shake your ass.
- Yeah!

598
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,433
- Manila, Manila, just shake
your back.

599
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,233
- [laughs]

600
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:02,700
- Yeah, we just shake the ass.
- How are you doing that?

601
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,066
- I'm moving, I'm moving.

602
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,433
- I don't know how to do this.

603
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:09,633
- The cha-cha is inside all of
you.

604
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:13,900
Hey, I want to do this.
It's like...

605
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,333
We supposed to be touching each
other's back.

606
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,734
- Oh, hey, girls.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

607
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:21,400
Boom!

608
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,367
Don't leave the back.
Don't leave the back.

609
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,900
No, no, what are you doing,
Manila?

610
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
- Again.

611
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,200
- Can we do this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

612
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,633
- Can we just not put it in
front of our faces?

613
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,467
'Cause I don't want to block
this mug.

614
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,900
- Hey, hey, watch out!
- [exclaims in Spanish]

615
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,300
- I'm not really a dancer,
and so picking up choreography

616
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,900
is like not the easiest thing
for me to do.

617
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,233
<i>We're down to the final four.</i>

618
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>I don't want to fuck this up,</i>
<i>so...</i>

619
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,367
Awesome, guys.
Go team.

620
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,567
- This is gonna be a mess.

621
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,400
- [laughs]

622
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,467
[alarm beeps]

623
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,900
- Money morning!

624
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,300
- Money, money, money,

625
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,066
money, money, money.

626
00:22:58,066 --> 00:22:59,367
- Oh, my god.

627
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,233
Feel like I should've just had a
bed here.

628
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,467
- I know. Like, what was the
point of even going back home?

629
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,967
- We haven't sleep or nothing.

630
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,533
- There's a lot of pressure,

631
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,100
and it's really important for me

632
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
to do a great job on this

633
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,467
challenge, because it's one of

634
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,800
our last challenges.

635
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
And if I don't do a good job,

636
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,333
I'm gonna be in the bottom two
again.

637
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,567
[sighs] All right.

638
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,667
- You guys, did we use every
single glue stick there is?

639
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,767
- Yes.

640
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,367
- Yes, we did. See?

641
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,066
- Did you use the extra
million dollars?

642
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,233
- Yes, except for--
- Everything?

643
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,467
- Except for this one.
- Wow.

644
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,100
- 'Cause I wanted a big one.

645
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,200
- That's a lot of dress, honey.

646
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,066
<i>- Yara's is way too</i>
<i>complicated.</i>

647
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,133
<i>And I understand avant-garde,</i>

648
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,867
<i>but it's just really crazy.</i>

649
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,233
If she were to sit down in it,

650
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,734
it would look like a pile of
garbage.

651
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,300
Yara, it's like a tropical
garden.

652
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,600
It's really huge.

653
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,633
- I don't care if

654
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,867
the other girls will like it.

655
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,533
I'm focused on my stuff.

656
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:54,233
RuPaul is gonna love it.

657
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,333
- Who's top three?

658
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,567
- I would like to be me,
Yara, and Alexis.

659
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,567
- Manila, you think it's gonna
be easier for you to win

660
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,266
the competition if Raja's gone?

661
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,233
- If it all goes correctly,

662
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,533
then I should be in the top
three.

663
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,867
- If you don't make the top
three,

664
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,834
the decision is incorrect.

665
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,166
- Sure.

666
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:13,100
I put so much energy into this
competition from day one,

667
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,367
and I feel like I really worked
my hands to the bone,

668
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,400
and I need to be in the top
three.

669
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,333
It's just so close.

670
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,934
- The top three gonna be me,
Raja, and Yara.

671
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:25,266
- Never, never, never

672
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,734
in a million years.

673
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,166
Where's Manila going?

674
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,867
- Home. After tonight.

675
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,800
- Hey.
- I deserve it.

676
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,433
I want Alexis in the top three.

677
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,500
And the other one, I don't know.

678
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,467
- Since Manila and I had a--

679
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,633
had a pretty close relationship

680
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,867
throughout this competition,

681
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,100
I would like to see her there.

682
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,667
- I deserve it, motherfuckers.

683
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,934
I'm gonna make the top three,

684
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,400
because I worked very hard

685
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,066
for this, and I'm gonna let them

686
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,066
have it!

687
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,800
<i>[laughter]</i>

688
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,734
<i>- And what?</i>

689
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,166
Hey, guys!

690
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,300
Welcome to the main stage

691
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,533
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

692
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:16,066
Hey, Michelle, you like?

693
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,400
- I love.

694
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,333
- Mike Ruiz, you look like
a million dollars.

695
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,567
- Oh, so do you.

696
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,633
- Well, you know, as Dolly

697
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,567
says, "it takes a lot of money

698
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,867
to look this cheap."

699
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,166
- [laughs]

700
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,233
- Gigi Levangie Grazer,

701
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,767
how does a Hollywood wife make
her money?

702
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,266
- Well, we earn it the
old-fashioned way, RuPaul--

703
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,567
through divorce.

704
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,533
- [laughs]

705
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:40,600
- L.A. Toya, you're back by my
request.

706
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,066
- And I will do anything for
you, Ru, you know that.

707
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,066
- Oh, honey, that's big money,

708
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:46,500
La Toya, if you ask me.

709
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,100
both: [laugh]

710
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,667
- This week our queens

711
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,900
were challenged to create

712
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,166
three million-dollar looks

713
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,467
for the make-dat-money ball.

714
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,066
To kick things off,

715
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,567
they're gonna make it rain

716
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,066
to La Toya Jackson's

717
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,066
<i>Just Wanna Dance.</i>

718
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:05,700

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,934
And may the best woman win.

performing to La Toya's song

00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,800

- Wow!

726
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:11,867
- Whoo!

727
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,633
- Amazing!

Yara Sofia.

731
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,934
- She's the merry widow,

732
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,533
ready for her next husband.

733
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,667
- Yes.

734
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,867
- It's like she's getting ready

735
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,266
for Liberace's funeral.

736
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,567
- Uh-huh.

737
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,867
<i>- My cocktail dress is inspired</i>

738
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,300
<i>by Nina Ricci, like,</i>

739
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,200
<i>very Evita Peron,</i>

740
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,834
<i>very sophisticated, very dark.</i>

741
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,100
- And I love the gloves on her.

742
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,300
- It's very film noir.

743
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,567
- The widow wore gold.

744
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,300
Up next, Alexis Mateo.

745
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,967
- Ooh!
-<i> Goldfinger.</i>

746
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,133
- Ooh!

747
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,200
<i>- With my cocktail dress,</i>

748
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
<i>I think about myself.</i>

749
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,834
<i>Alexis always cha-cha.</i>
<i>That's what the dress is.</i>

750
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:57,433
<i>I'm not gonna change myself</i>
<i>for nobody else.</i>

751
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:58,567
<i>I'm just gonna walk the dress,</i>

752
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,700
<i>and I know it looks sickening</i>
<i>on me.</i>

753
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,066
- The Golden Globes.

754
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,300
- It's like two canned hams

755
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,500
under a blanket, fighting it
out.

756
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,934
- Really, yes. Ooh, I love ham.

757
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,433
Manila.

758
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,633
- Hey, girl, hey!
- All right!

759
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:10,667
- Lots of attitude.

760
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,233
This reminds me of a disco.

761
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,066
<i>- Well, I don't know about Ru,</i>
<i>but I take my disco nap</i>

762
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,667
<i>at 5:00 P.M., so this is going</i>

763
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,367
<i>to be an after-5:00-A.M. Look,</i>

764
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,667
<i>yes, and, honey, I am still</i>

765
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,800
<i>partying, and I'm about to go</i>

766
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,066
<i>to the after-party, honey.</i>

767
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,700
- New year's eve 1984.

768
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,767
- Oh, my god.

769
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,400
'80s in the San Fernando Valley.

770
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,400
- For the love of money.

771
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,867
Up next, Raja.

772
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:33,600
Ooh, Raja and the gold rush.

773
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,900
<i>- The look for my cocktail</i>

774
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,533
<i>dress is a little bit heiress,</i>

775
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,333
<i>and it's a little eccentric.</i>

776
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,667
- I own everything, and I

777
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,800
bought it on my American Express

778
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,467
Gold card, darling.

779
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,500
Category is million-dollar

780
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,834
Evening Gown Eleganza.

781
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,834
Yara Sofia.

782
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,934
- She blew her cash wad.

783
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:54,133
- Yes.

784
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,734
It's Marie Antoinette.

785
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,133
- Cha-ching.

786
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,100
<i>- I'm doing my runway,</i>

787
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,567
<i>and I feel like a queen,</i>

788
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,133
<i>and it feels so great.</i>

789
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,333
<i>I feel so powerful.</i>

790
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,600
<i>The avant-garde for me</i>

791
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,734
<i>is everything.</i>

792
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:06,900
- She's got the credit cards

793
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,867
in there too.

794
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,900
- Her whole safety deposit box.

795
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,333
- Suze Orman called.

796
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,600
She wants her Fico score back.

797
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,433
- [laughs]

798
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,800
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.

799
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,100
- Goddess of the sea.

800
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,567
- Yes. Yes, like scales.
- They're like fish scales.

801
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,200
<i>- I wanted to look like a</i>
<i>mermaid.</i>

802
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,600
<i>I wanted to look like tropical,</i>

803
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,834
<i>flowers, colors.</i>

804
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,266
<i>I wanted to look very pageant</i>
<i>as well.</i>

805
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:34,133
- It's like the Little Mermaid
meets Lil' Kim.

806
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,834
- Yes, it is!

807
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,066
Mo' money, mo' problems.

808
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:40,300
You can bet your bottom dollar,

809
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,834
and I do mean bottom.

810
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:44,066
Manila.
- Imelda markup.

811
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:47,433
- Imelda markup, that's right.
- It's better than a markdown.

812
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,633
<i>- For my evening gown made of</i>

813
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,066
<i>money, the judges are really</i>

814
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:50,967
<i>liking my look.</i>

815
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,867
<i>I think my hair is just so big</i>

816
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:53,800
<i>that they have to love it.</i>

817
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,066
<i>I mean, come on, who doesn't</i>

818
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,800
<i>love a drag queen with gigantic</i>
<i>hair?</i>

819
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,066
- She looks like a Texas
tycoon's wife.

820
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,200
- Yes!

821
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,667
Black gold.

822
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,967
both: Texas tea!

823
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,200
- [laughs]

824
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,667
- I think her economy

825
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,233
just double-dipped.

826
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,834
Up next, Raja.

827
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:09,800
- Wow.

828
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,934
- Ow!

829
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,433
<i>- Ultimately I had this idea</i>

830
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:14,800
<i>of this 1930s sort of starlet,</i>

831
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,834
<i>and she is going on a train</i>

832
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,367
<i>to the Hearst castle to meet up</i>

833
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,200
<i>with all of her fancy buddies,</i>

834
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,667
<i>and I think it looks fantastic.</i>

835
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,467
<i>I think I look like an exotic</i>
<i>bird.</i>

836
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:25,000
- She owns the world.

837
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,967
- If I had the dollars...

838
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,567
- Very Linda Evangelista.

839
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,166
- All the honeys making money.

840
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,433
Welcome, ladies.

841
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,800
It's time for the judges'
critiques.

842
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
Yara Sofia.

843
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,667
- Yes?

844
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,834
- Penny for your thoughts.

845
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,133
- [chuckles]

846
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,333
This is my inspiration,

847
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,633
from Alexander McQueen.

848
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:48,166
- Yes.

849
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,834
- And the hair is my trademark.

850
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,367
My pop-it-ons.

851
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,533
- Your pop-it-ons.

852
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:54,700
- But this time covered

853
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,867
in money.

854
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:59,033
- Yara, you are absolutely
gorgeous.

855
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,200
- Thank you.

856
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,433
- I do think that it's
a bit busy.

857
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,200
All the gold necklace and then

858
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,066
the gold going into the bustier,

859
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,433
with the hair and the necklace,

860
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,633
it's almost like that.

861
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:11,934
- Your cocktail dress

862
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,266
presentation was a little

863
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,467
morose, and I would've hoped

864
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,734
that you would've been a little

865
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,300
more effervescent, you know,

866
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
on every level.

867
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,100
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.

868
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,266
- I love what you've done

869
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,533
to this dress.

870
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:29,200
This is why I know you could've

871
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
done something much better

872
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,533
with the bathing suit than

873
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,633
what I saw.

874
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,066
- And it's pretty much the same

875
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,367
for your cocktail dress.

876
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,567
I think it was just a little

877
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:38,900
too simple for me.

878
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,066
- When you came out in

879
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,133
the bathing suit, I thought,

880
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,266
I'm so glad she got rid of Ike.

881
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:43,533
- [laughs]

882
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:47,767
- That Tina Turner wig was
fabulous. I loved it.

883
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,066
- The problem with the swimsuit

884
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,400
for me was that it was too
<i>abuelita.</i>

885
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,834
It was too grandma.

886
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,500
And because it was cut low,

887
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,166
it made you look bulky.

888
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,934
- All right, up next, Manila.

889
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,333
- Hi, judges.

890
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,500
- Now, tell us about this dress.

891
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,900
It looks like Beverly Hills
shrubbery.

892
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,767
- You know, at the end of

893
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:06,767
the night when you open your

894
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,066
drag bag to see all your tips...

895
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,066
- Yes.

896
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:09,867
- They're all crumpled

897
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,433
and sweaty, and so I thought

898
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,600
that it would be kind of

899
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
interesting to, like, tear up

900
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,433
money and crumple them,

901
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,500
and then, um, glue them on here.

902
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,533
- When I look at the pink

903
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:19,800
flower in your hair,

904
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
it's absolutely gorgeous.

905
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,166
It enhances your color tones.

906
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,200
I did feel and think your hair

907
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,633
was a little bit too big.

908
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:27,734
- How dare you!

909
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,834
all: [laugh]

910
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,100
- I'm a drag queen!

911
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,834
both: [laugh]

912
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,166
- Well, I loved your swimsuit
presentation.

913
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,867
It was very Saint-Tropez,
French Riviera.

914
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:39,967
It was very Samantha Jones,

915
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,500
you know, goes to the Hamptons.

916
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,867
I loved it.
- It all worked.

917
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,700
It was thought out, and it was
executed beautifully.

918
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,133
- The cocktail attire,

919
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,867
very Mahogany, very Diana Ross.

920
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,700
I wanna go to that cocktail
party.

921
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,100
- All right, up next, Raja.

922
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,233
- Hi.

923
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,533
- When you walk out,

924
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,734
you act as if you own the stage,

925
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:04,333
and I wanna focus on you,

926
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,533
because you give me, you demand

927
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,066
that attention from me.

928
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,066
And that's what I love about
you.

929
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:13,100
But your after-5:00 to me
was so plain.

930
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,533
It was so simple.

931
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,700
It was so ordinary.

932
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,266
The entire outfit, to be quite

933
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:20,133
frank with you, reminded me of

934
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,200
a Pointer sister.

935
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,066
- All right, ladies,

936
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:31,433
here's the $75,000 question--

937
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,133
why do you deserve to be crowned

938
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:37,367
America's next drag superstar?

939
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:41,266
Let's start with Yara.

940
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,867
- I'm so broke.

941
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,066
all: [laugh]

942
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:47,367
- Uh, I don't have anything in
my bank.

943
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,834
My credit card is over--

944
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,900
is overdrawn, and I need money

945
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,767
to--to move to the states,

946
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,400
and I would like to live

947
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,667
the American dream.

948
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,667
I have charisma, uniqueness,

949
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,967
nerve, and talent.

950
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,834
I have everything.
I'm the full package.

951
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:05,467
- All right, Alexis,
same question.

952
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,834
- I think I deserve to be

953
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,100
America's next drag superstar

954
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,900
because inside of me, like every

955
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,266
American and every real person,

956
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,166
I am not perfect, but I have

957
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,066
the desire to continue.

958
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,066
And if I can move forward

959
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:21,066
in the competition and become

960
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,400
America's next drag superstar,

961
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,600
I would do it with honor,

962
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,066
respect, and proud.

963
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,266
- Manila, why do you deserve

964
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,533
to be crowned America's next

965
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,367
drag superstar?

966
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,567
- I came to this competition
blessed.

967
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,900
I feel like I represent

968
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,767
the product of a loving

969
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,100
and supportive family.

970
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,400
I'm not a Cinderella story.

971
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,734
My parents didn't kick me out.

972
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:48,767
My parents have been very loving

973
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,066
and very supportive.

974
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,400
And I have a beautiful family.

975
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,767
And I think that I carry

976
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,467
a message of--to love and be

977
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,166
really supportive of--of all

978
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,433
your friends and your family,

979
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,934
because we all have, like,

980
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,333
the power inside of us.

981
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,467
We just need that extra push,

982
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,533
and I'm here to--

983
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,600
to speak that.

984
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,533
- Raja, same question.

985
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,800
- In winning this competition,

986
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
I would love to leave a legacy

987
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,700
for all those little boys...

988
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,800
[sighs]

989
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
All the little boys who are

990
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,100
teased, who are afraid,

991
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,200
who don't know how to express

992
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,834
themselves creatively yet,

993
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,800
you know, and they don't even

994
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,934
know that they're allowed to go

995
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,300
against the grain.

996
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,667
It's okay to say fuck you,

997
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,967
and do what you love to do,

998
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,300
and express yourself thoroughly.

999
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,934
I wanna be an example of someone

1000
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,900
who is proud, someone who is

1001
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,433
accomplished, and someone who

1002
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,133
loves--loves what they do.

1003
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,300
- The power of Fuck You.

1004
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,667
all: [laugh]

1005
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,967
- Well, girls, I think we've

1006
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,200
heard enough.

1007
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,834
Now, while you go and untuck

1008
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,567
in the interior illusions

1009
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,734
lounge, the judges and I

1010
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:01,633
will deliberate.

1011
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:02,867
All right, just between us

1012
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:05,133
gargoyles, what do ya think?

1013
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:07,066
Let's start with Yara Sofia.

1014
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,066
- To me, it looked like she got

1015
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,800
run over by a Brink's truck.

1016
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
- It was a miss.
It was too much.

1017
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,967
- Her speech, I'm sorry,
but I felt for her.

1018
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,367
- You're a softie.

1019
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:17,066
- Oh, my god, this poor thing.

1020
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,300
She doesn't have any money.

1021
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,467
- I really felt for her,

1022
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,433
but, you know, I don't think

1023
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,200
we can pick a drag superstar

1024
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
based on the fact that we feel
sorry for them.

1025
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,667
- Right. All right,
let's move on to Alexis.

1026
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,066
- She's not utilizing her body

1027
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:31,066
the way she should and could.

1028
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,500
Just the bathing suit alone.

1029
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,233
- It was like a middle-aged
woman trying to get laid

1030
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,667
at Jones beach.

1031
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,834
- If you're gonna pick a
proportion like an hourglass

1032
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,767
in that dress, why are you gonna

1033
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,066
pull all of your hair back

1034
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,300
into this teeny-tiny--

1035
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,433
she looked like Beetlejuice.

1036
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:45,734
both: [laugh]

1037
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:48,400
- All right, let's move on
to Manila.

1038
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,734
- The swimsuit was beautiful.

1039
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,066
It was feminine. It was elegant.

1040
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:53,934
Totally nailed the challenge as
far as that goes.

1041
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,667
- She has incredible stage
presence.

1042
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,900
She's always on when she's up
here.

1043
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,967
She's the queen of that coy

1044
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,934
kind of thing, and you have to

1045
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,867
take that into consideration...
- Sure.

1046
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,433
- When these people have your
name attached to them as

1047
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,200
America's next drag superstar.

1048
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
- Let's move on to Raja.

1049
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,100
Now, I've just gotta start with
that gown...

1050
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,066
- Crazy good.

1051
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:14,133
- Which was just breathtaking.

1052
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,800
- Two words about the cocktail
dress, Ru.

1053
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,066
- Mm-hmm.
- Oil can.

1054
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,934
- [laughs]

1055
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,834
- I'm probably gonna lose it
again, but listening to Raja's

1056
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,967
speech, I was one of those
little boys.

1057
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,400
I was one of those little boys
who wanted a beacon of hope,

1058
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,667
who wanted somebody to look up
to, to say, "you know what,

1059
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:30,967
it's gonna be okay.

1060
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,233
Be yourself, and be creative,

1061
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,467
and be inspired, and think

1062
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,700
outside of the box, and don't

1063
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,133
let anyone ever tell you
that you can't."

1064
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,467
You know, so, to me, I don't

1065
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,400
even care what Raja was wearing
tonight.

1066
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,767
- [claps]
Silence!

1067
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:47,133
I've made my decision.

1068
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,233
Bring back my girls.

1069
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,367
Welcome back, ladies.

1070
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,667
Now, based on your performance

1071
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,533
in the make-dat-money ball,

1072
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,867
I've made some decisions.

1073
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,967
Manila, this week you looked

1074
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,834
like a high roller,

1075
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:11,066
but did you hit the jackpot?

1076
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:15,266
Raja, your Evening Gown Eleganza

1077
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:18,166
was top dollar, but were you

1078
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,200
outspent on the runway?

1079
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,700
Manila, condragulations,

1080
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,633
you are the winner of this

1081
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:31,800
week's challenge.

1082
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,166
- Oh, my god.

1083
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,834
<i>- You will receive a collection</i>

1084
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,066
<i>of fine jewelry from</i>

1085
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,367
<i>Kathy Ireland Jewelry.</i>

1086
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,667
- Thank you, guys.

1087
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,400
I won, I won!

1088
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,300
Two weeks in a row, bitches.

1089
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:52,133
- Raja...

1090
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,233
You're safe.

1091
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,533
Alexis Mateo, Yara Sofia,

1092
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:01,767
I'm sorry, my dears,

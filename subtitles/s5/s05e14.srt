<i>You know, I'm street smart,</i>

183
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,133
and there's nothing wrong
with that.

184
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,667
-<i> That is a nice ass.</i>

185
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,066
-<i> And it's not padded.</i>

186
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,066
-<i> Monica is slaying the hell</i>
<i>out of Serena,</i>

187
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:23,100
<i>and I'm very happy.</i>

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,934
- We all love you.
- We love you.

189
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,533
[cheers and applause]

190
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,433
- Welcome, ladies.

191
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,633
Welcome.

192
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,200
First up, Penny Tration.

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,567
Now, Penny, was it hard to, uh,
go home first?

194
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:37,633
- It was great.

195
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,667
I got to get away
from these bitches.

196
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,333
- Oh, okay. All right.

197
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,467
So now, which of the challenges
would you have rocked?

198
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,066
- Oh, I think
the reading challenge

199
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,500
was pretty much my forte.

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,567
- Oh, well, today's
your lucky day, darling,

201
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,567
because the library is open!

202
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,367
- Let's start with
a hometown favorite,

203
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,100
the lovely Detox.

204
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,433
Detox, when you walk down
the runway,

205
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,467
I do expect for the credits

206
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,500
to start running
for<i> Gorillas in the Mist.</i>

207
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,834
[laughter]

208
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,934
And to my dear, dear Serena,

209
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,500
I would read you,
but it does appear

210
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,533
life already has.

211
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,900
[audience "ohs"]

212
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,467
- All right.

213
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:29,400
Okay, well, now, the library
is closed...officially.

214
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,500
Next up, Serena ChaCha.

215
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,367
Now, your art school background

216
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,233
seemed to rub people
the wrong way.

217
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,967
So what would you have done
differently?

218
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,367
- I would've shut my ass up

219
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,734
and worn a sequin dress

220
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,734
and asked to borrow
one of Coco's pair of earrings

221
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,967
and walked down that runway
full of glam.

222
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:48,633
- Okay, well, which challenge
would you have rocked?

223
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,333
- As a fan of telenovelas,

224
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,133
Luis Fernando Sylvester
Montalban...

225
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,166
[speaking Spanish]

226
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,667
[cheers and applause]

227
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,600
-<i> Escandalo!</i>

228
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,066
Ugh!

229
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,600
Now, a lot of big revelations
happened

230
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,967
on the main stage,

231
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,200
but one of the most moving
came from Monica Beverly Hillz.

232
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,500
It raised a lot of questions

233
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,400
about what is drag
and what is trans.

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
When we come back,
I'm gonna ask Monica

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,734
for some answers.

236
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,333
Don't go away.

237
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,533
-<i> Coming up,</i>

238
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,734
<i>the queens answer</i>
<i>viewer questions.</i>

239
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,200

<i>Team Jinkx?</i>

<i>Or team Roxxxy?</i>

243
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,367
<i>Let your voice be heard</i>

244

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,967
- [laughs]

246
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:51,100
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,700
We are just moments away
from finding out which queen

248
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,066
will be crowned America's
next drag superstar,

249
00:11:57,066 --> 00:12:00,400
but first, let's talk
to another fierce queen,

250
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,066
Monica Beverly Hillz.

251
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:05,367
- Hi, mama.

252
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:08,667
- Now, Monica, you came
on to the show with passion,

253
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,133
poise, and a secret.

254
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,433
Let's take a look.

255
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,467
Monica, tell me
what's on your mind.

256
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,800
- It's true what you're saying.

257
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,467
There is a lot going
through my head.

258
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,867
I feel I'm not here.

259
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,533
I've just
been holding a secret in,

260
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,467
and I've been trying so hard,
and--

261
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,934
- What secret?

262
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,400
- I'm not just a drag queen.

263
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,266
I'm a transgendered woman.

264
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,867
[cheers and applause]

265
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,367
- Monica...

266
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,967
You know, there's a lot of
confusion out there,

267
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,767
so help everybody out.

268
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,467
Okay, now, can a girl
be a drag queen

269
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,667
and a trans woman
at the same time?

270
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,233
- Yes.
Drag is what I do.

271
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,066
Trans is who I am.

272
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,333
- All right. All right.

273
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,700
Yeah.

274
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,767
And you know, for the record,

275
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,433
everybody out there,
the only requirement

276
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:56,967
for being here is the desire
to be America's

277
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:00,934
next drag superstar,
and the only thing we screen for

278
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,500
is charisma, uniqueness,

279
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
nerve,
and talent.

280
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,567
[cheers and applause]

281
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:15,266
Now, uh, how have things been
since the show?

282
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,467
- It's been really great.

283
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,567
I actually got approached
by a cosmetic line.

284
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:22,066
I'm a face model now, so--
- What?

285
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,066
- I'm good at giving face, baby.

286
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,800
It's my moneymaker.

287
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,700
- Next up, a sexy Puerto Rican

288
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,166
and a bicoastal twosome
that made me do something

289
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,400
I thought I'd never do:
a double elimination.

290
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Oh, shoot!
[laughs]

291
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,867
Take a look.

292
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,066
Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,

293
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:45,200
neither one of you showed me
the fire it takes to stay.

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,834
I'm sending you both home.

295
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,066
Ladies, welcome.

296
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,233
Now, Vivienne, you've been

297
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,066
called
the fishiest queen ever.

298
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,567
Now, do you think
being fishy is enough?

299
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:01,867
- Well, for me it is.

300
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,467
[laughter]

301
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,100
Now, was it enough
for this season?

302
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,367
Obviously not.

303
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,800
If it were America's
next drag supermodel,

304
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
I would definitely be
in the top three.

305
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,867
- All right, all right.

306
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,433
Now...

307
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,066
Girl, I heard a rumor
that you work

308
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,467
for Alyssa Edwards now.

309
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,400
Is that true?
- [laughs]

310
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,300
Well, she likes to think so.

311
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,934
But I haven't received
my first paycheck, so...

312
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,567
- Oh, bitch.
- I don't know.

313
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,600
[audience "ohs"]

314
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,100
[laughing]

315
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,467
But what I have been doing,

316
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:35,266
I've been doing
makeup tutorials online.

317
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,266
- Oh, okay.

318
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,700
Do you think
I'd look good in makeup?

319
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,867
[audience laughing]

320
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,066
No, I'm serious.

321
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,200
I mean, I wanna try it.

322
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,834
- Well, girl...

323
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,900
[cheers and applause]

324
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,367
Girl, I like you
how you are right now

325
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,367
in your natural state.

326
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,400
- Uh-huh.

327
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,533
- But if you do wanna try it,

328
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,367
I would start off
with a tinted moisturizer.

329
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,633
- Okay, okay.

330
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,900
That's good advice.

331
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,133
Up next, Honey Mahogany.

332
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,600
Yes, mama.

333
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,700
Now, Honey, your style
was criticized

334
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,066
for being a little too

335
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,400
Bed, Bath, and Beyonce,
you know?

336
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,066
Now, what do you have to say
for yourself?

337
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:18,934
- Well, I found myself
a fab new style team

338
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,300
in San Francisco, where the look
does matter.

339
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,467
[audience cheers, laughs]

340
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,166
And, um, I have a little
something I'd like to show you.

341
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,867
- Oh.
Ooh, ooh.

342
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,100
Ooh!

343
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,300
[cheers and applause]

344
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,967
- All right.

345
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,367
- [mouthing words]

346
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,367
- Wow.

347
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,500
- Do you want me
to turn around?

348
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,767
Should I turn around?
- Yeah.

349
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,066
- Yes.

350
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,066
- All right.

351
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,667
TrimSpa, baby.

352
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,300
[laughter]

353
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,133
Now, Honey, as our first
San Francisco queen,

354
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,467
can you describe
the San Francisco style?

355
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,700
- You know, it's hard to
describe the San Francisco style

356
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,467
because there are so many
different types of drag

357
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,567
in San Francisco.

358
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:06,500
We have fairies,
we have bearded ladies,

359
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,066
we have glamour queens,

360
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,500
pageant girls,
the Ducal Court--

361
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,700
we've got it all.

362
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,333
- Oh, all right.
I love it!

363
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,333
Now, Honey, San Francisco
is so proud of you

364
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,834
and so am I.

365
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,333
Keep representing, girl.

366
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,867
- Thank you, Ru.

367
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,433
- Up next, Lineysha Sparx.

368
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,433
Now--

369
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:29,500
[cheers and applause]

370
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,066
So, now, Lineysha,
Charo couldn't make it tonight

371
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:37,100
to translate, so why don't you
address the audience

372
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,200
in Spanish?

373
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,900
It might be easier
in your native tongue.

374
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
- Of course.

375
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,934
[speaking Spanish]

376
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,133
[cheers and applause]

377
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,467
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.

378
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,433
Really, I couldn't have.

379
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,300
Lineysha, you know I love you,

380
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,533
but this season,
you committed a sin

381
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,900
that is unforgivable.

382
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,667
- Yeah?
- Take a look.

383
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,700
Who is playing Diana Ross?

384
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,166
- That would be
Miss Lineysha here.

385
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,233
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?

386
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,066
- Um, not really, no.

387
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,200
[glass shattering]

388
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,166
- Okay.

389
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,266
- [laughing]

390
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,467
- Okay.

391
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:21,734
Lineysha, do you know
who Diana Ross is now?

392
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:22,934
- Well, right now, yes.

393
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,266
I love--she's banana dance.
That is not--

394
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,300
- That's Josephine Baker, baby.
- Ah, sorry.

395
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Um, no, but it's just kidding.

396
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,066
It's just kidding.

397
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,100
- Okay, so name
a Diana Ross song.

398
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,900
- Diana Ross song?

399
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,066
I know that she move like this.

400
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,200
And she's--

401
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
That was--I was practicing.

402
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,934
- Um, immigration?

403
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,533
- Ru! How rude!

404
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,667
[laughter and applause]

405
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,834
- Immigration?

406
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,800
- [giggling]

407
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,166
- Well, you're not alone,

408
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,266
because I know there are
a lot of young'uns out there

409
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,066
that could use a course
in gay miracles.

410
00:17:56,066 --> 00:18:00,100
Pay attention, because there
will be a pop quiz.

411
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Time for your Drag Race
herstory minute.

412
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,066
The reading rainbow
begins with

413
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,166
the one and only Judy Garland.

414
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,633
You know, she played that girl
in the stoner film

415
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,400
about the ruby-red pumps.

416
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
The glamorous '40s gave us
broads like Bette Davis,

417
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Joan Crawford,
and Lena Horne.

418
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
The '50s dropped
atomic blonde bombshells--

419
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,100
Marilyn Monroe, Doris Day,
and Etta James.

420
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,300
That's right, a sister can have
blonde hair too.

421
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,667
The swinging '60s gave us
the super-duper Supremes,

422
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,567
"Tinta" Turner,
and Barbra Streisand.

423
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,734
Well, hello, gorgeous!

424
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:38,367
The "me" decade of the 1970s
saw Diana go solo,

425
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,066
Dolly split with Porter,

426
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,633
and Farrah told
<i>Charlie's Angels</i>

427
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,200
to kiss her T&amp;A good-bye.

428
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,533
The '80s were a holiday,
as the rhythm nation showed

429
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:51,667
its true colors with Madonna,
Janet, and Cyndi.

430
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,934
Oh, and Faye Dunaway
stole my heart

431
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:59,133
with just three little words:
"No wire hangers!"

432
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,233
The '90s were dominated
by Mimi,

433
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,700
Whitney, Britney, and X-Tina

434
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,867
and a little girl group

435
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,533
goin' by the name
of Destiny's Child.

436
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:10,133
Which brings us to today's
reigning divas:

437
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,533
Gaga, Beyonce, Katy, and Nicki.

438
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,233
And if you didn't learn
anything else,

439
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,066
just remember one thing:

440
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,533
Cher, Cher, Cher, Cher, stupid.

441
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,633
And that's today's
drag herstory minute.

442
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,133
[laughs]

443
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:31,467
And, honey, that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

444
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:35,200
So please tweet me
your favorite divas @RuPaul.

445

Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>

453
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,800
Now, these next two queens
represented

454
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,667
the ultimate contrast
in styles.

455
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,333
One was quiet, ladylike,
and demure,

456
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,100
and the other was, well,
Jade Jolie.

457
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,333
Take a look.

458
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,967

then you'll see
a whole new side.

461
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,066
Girl, you ain't that pretty.
- Oh.

462
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,133
- Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.

463
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,367
You're a dirty bitch.

464
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,033
- I don't understand

466
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,934
- You had rolls
all over the place in the back.

467
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,467
It was disgusting.

468
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,967
- Back rolls?

469
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,834
-<i> My name is Ivy Winters.</i>

470
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,266
- Are those your pictures
on there?

471
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,600
- They're all my face.

472
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,266
I will figure out a way
to turn it into a costume.

473
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,600
- You make everything
that you wear?

474
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,533
- I do.

475
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,000
- You're mind-blowingly
talented.

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,066
- This week's winner is...

477
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,400
Ivy! Ivy!

[echoing]
Ivy Winters!

479
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,266
- Hi, mama.
- [laughs]

480
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,834
Miss Jolie.

481
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,367
You know,
when you first arrived,

482
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,166
everybody thought you were
gonna be the sweet one.

483
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,200
But you turned into
a Sour Patch Kid.

484
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,834
What was going on?
- Me too.

485
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,633
I swear I was America's
sweetheart until I watched it.

486
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,066
I was like,
that's a cunt, honey.

487
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,400
[laughter]

488
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,967
But it was rainbowy
and gorgeous, so it was okay.

489
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,200
- Now, I wanna ask you,

490
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,567
do you regret accusing
Alyssa Edwards of having...

491
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,300
back rolls?

492
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,367
- Oh, my gosh.
- Back rolls?

493
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:19,967
- [laughs]

494
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,934
I consider Alyssa
one of my very good friends,

495
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,934
and I think she's fabulous
and fierce.

496
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:29,600
- All right.
Up next, Ivyyyyy Winters!

497
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,066
Now, Ivy, you showcased

498
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:35,467
one breathtaking outfit
after another.

499
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,567
Now, do you think
the other queens were jealous?

500
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,734
- No, I sew
for a lot of drag queens,

501
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:42,266
so if you're jealous, you can
always call me.

502
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,867
- Oh, okay. All right.

503
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,867
Well, it pays to advertise.

[laughter]

505
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,934
Do you have any regrets?

506
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:50,467
- Yes, I would have to say
my Marilyn.

507
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,800
- Oh, is that who you were
playing?

508
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,834
- That's what I was--
[laughs]

509
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,567
- What was it like
to see yourself

510
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,533
as Norma Jean, Miss Thang?

511
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,066
- That was, like, the first time
I've ever tried

512
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,567
impersonating someone.
- Yeah.

513
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,333
- I wish I would've went
with my second choice.

514
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,433
- So what would you have done
if you hadn't done Marilyn?

515
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,667
- I would've done Julia Child.

516
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,934
- Really?

517
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,166

00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,900
- Because I love the show, Ru,
and I love you.

536
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,633
- Aw, thank you.
Thank you.

537
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,767
- I do.
- That's very sweet.

538
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:04,166
Now, La Toya, in 1989,
you did a pay-per-view concert

539
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,533
called<i> A Sizzling Spectacular.</i>

540
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,100
Do you remember that?
- Sort of, yeah.

541
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,166
- Well, I gotta tell ya.

542
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,066
I became so obsessed
with the way

543
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:14,500
you introduced
musician Edgar Winters.

544
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,233
Would you introduce him
for me now?

545
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,300
- Okay.

546
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
Edgar Winters!

547
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,700
- Yeah, okay.

548
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,533
Well, but I gotta tell ya,

549
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,200
it was more like,

550
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,200
"Ivyyyyy Winterrrrs!"

551
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,667
- Edgarrrrrr Winters!

552
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,433
- I want everybody
in the audience to say it.

553
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,200
all: Ivyyyyy Winters.

554
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,300
- Okay, now, La Toya,
you say Edgar Winters.

555
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,266
- Okay.

556
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:43,100
Edgarrrr Winters!

557
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,967
[laughter]

558
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,767
- Ivyyyyy Winters!

559
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,467
- No! Edgarrrrr Winters,
you guys!

560
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,867
- [cackling]

561
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,967
- It is.

562
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,333
I don't know.

563
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,767
Now you know.

564
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,100
- La Toya, thank you so much
for clearing that up.

565
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,400
And I know you gotta go,
but would you like to hear

566
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,100
a little bit of our new duet
as you leave?

567
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,767
- Ooh, of course I would.
Are you kidding?

568
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,500
- It's called<i> Feel Like Dancin'.</i>

569
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Hit it!

570
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,467
-<i> ♪ I feel like dancin' ♪</i>

571
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:12,633
- Let the music play.

572
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,834

573
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,700

Oh, wow!

578
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,133
Now, all drag queens
throw shade,

579
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,066
but this season,

580
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,367
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards

581
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,633
were heavyweight champions.

582
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:32,400
Let's take a look.

583
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
- Oh, boys!

584
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,400
- And then walks in
Coco Montrese.

585
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,633
- Oh, my God!

586
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,200
Alyssa Edwards.

587
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,900
-<i> We haven't spoke</i>
<i>in two years.</i>

588
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,333
- It was pure hell!

589
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,533
- And the Academy Award
goes to--

590
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,900
- Fuck you, Alyssa.

591
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,333
- And look how orange
you fucking look, girl.

592
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,367
- Now, Miss Alyssa...

593
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,433
- Whoo-whoo!

594
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,433
- Now, you pushed it.

595
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,467
- I'm joking with you.

596
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,567
- I'm not joking, bitch!

597
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,200
- Ladyboys and gentlemen,

598
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,066
it's the rematch of the century!

599
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:07,600
The Rumble
in the Lipstick Jungle!

600
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,767
Welcome to the center ring

601
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,100
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards!

602
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
[cheers and applause]

603
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,400
- Oh!

604
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
both: Mwah. Mwah.

605
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,767
- Ladies, welcome.

606
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,400
- Hello, hello.

607
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,066
- Now, I think I speak
on behalf

608
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,900
of all the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>

609
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,934
everywhere when I say,

610
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,433
"Girl, your feud was endless,
honey."

611
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:33,367
And confusing!

612
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,700
It was so confusing,
am I right?

613
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,500
But I think I finally
figured it out.

614
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,200
So I'm gonna try
and explain it to everyone

615
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,266
just like my play cousin
Cornisha would, okay?

616
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,266
All right.

617
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,467
Alyssa was crowned
Miss Thing USA,

618
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,367
but after she came up,

619
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,467
she wasn't holding it down
no mo'.

620
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,500
- [scoffs]

621
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,567
- So and since Coco

622
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,166
was still thirsty,
she damn well

623
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,233
cold-snatched the crown.

624
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,667
So Alyssa thought Coco
was frontin',

625
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,166
just 'cause she was grinding up
as first runner-up,

626
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,567
you know what I'm saying?

627
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:08,166
So basically, y'all mad
'cause y'all friends.

628
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,600
Am I right, ladies?
- [laughs]

629
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,734
- Yeah!

630
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,667
- That's what I thought.
- That's it.

631
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:15,066
- That's what I thought.

632
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:19,900
- I will say that coming
into it and seeing Coco,

633
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,600
I really wasn't bothered so much
about the pageant drama...

634
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,367
More or less how we were going
to be interacting

635
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,467
with each other.

636
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,133
- Yes. Okay.

637
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,333
So, Coco, what was it like

638
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,166
hearing the other queens say

639
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,066
that your makeup was busted?

640
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,066
- I mean, watching myself
back on TV,

641
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,333
I was like, "Ooh!

642
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,333
You do look like a Dorito."

643
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,266
[laughter]

644
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,266
But I think I got it now,
I think.

645
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,467
[cheers and applause]

646
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,700
- It looks good.

647
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,567
Well, Coco and Alyssa,

648
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,900
your lip-sync battle
was epic,

649
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,633
and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

650
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:54,867

I'm here
with best frenemies

Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards.

673
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,066
Now, Alyssa, your father
sent a message

674
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,500
and it really did bring
everyone to tears, you know?

675
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,867
Let's take a look at that.

676
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,367
- Oh, gosh.

677
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,867
- Somebody's dad
is on the phone.

678
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,100
- I know it's not mine.

679
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,066
My dad wouldn't even know
how to use the Skype.

680

00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,166

- So, Alyssa...

693
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:33,700
what's happened with your dad
since the show aired?

694
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,333
- For the very first time
in my life,

695
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,066
I'm starting to feel
forgiveness.

696
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:43,400
It's the most powerful feeling
one could ever feel,

697
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,967
and we are working on developing
a relationship.

698
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,867
My father is a grandfather,

699
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,166
and everything
that he couldn't do

700
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,433
for me or my siblings,

701
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,800
he's making up for with my niece
and nephews.

702
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,467
- I love it. I love it.

703

704
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,133
That's right.

705
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,533
You know,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race--</i>

706
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,066
still bringing families
together.

707
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,066
[laughter]

708
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,066
It's true.

709
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:10,166
Now, Alyssa,
Santino accused you

710
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,633
of wearing the worst dress
in five seasons.

711
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,867
But sometimes, the memory can
play tricks on us.

712
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,834
Take a look.

713
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:21,400
There's corn hanging
from her hand!

714
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,734
[laughter]

715
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,734
- It's not just an outfit,
it's a lifestyle.

716
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:25,700
[all screaming]

717
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,734
[laughter]

718
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:27,700
[buzzer]

719
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,166
- She's a little frosty.

720
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,166
- I see a lot of armpit.

721
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,066
Like, armpit!
- But it's fresh.

722
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,066
[laughter]

723
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,066
- ChaCha.

724
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,233
- She has to start thinking

725
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,533
about the way she's gonna

726
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,166
execute her fashions.

727
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,333
- Well, she executed this
fashion.

728
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,767
[laughter]

729
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,200
- Yes, honey,
this is a two-page spread.

730
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,433
- Ugh, it looks like a couch
from Rent-a-Center.

731
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,667
- Oh, Lord.

732
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,100
- Well, right now,
you're a mess.

733
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,066
Things are falling off.

734
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,100
No one can accuse you

735
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,066
of not having
a great pair of legs.

736
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,467
- [laughs]
- First of all.

737
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,100
[laughter and applause]

738
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,834
- No T, no shade, ladies.

739
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,767
Now, Santino.
- Yes?

740
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,033
- Do you still think Alyssa's

741
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,266
dress is the worst
in five seasons?

742
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,467
- I do.

743
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,300
[laughter]

744
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,533
And this is why, okay?

745
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,200
- Can we take a vote?

746
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,533
Can we take a vote?

747
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,700
- This is why.

748
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,333
Every season, Ru asks the queens
to make a dress

749
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,300
and do it
in four to six hours.

750
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,834
Alyssa, you brought that dress
with you.

751
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:25,767
[laughter]

752
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,166
You brought that dress
with you.

753
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,767
That dress, it doesn't look
as bad on TV

754
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,467
as it did in person, but--

755
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,500
[audience "ohs"]

756
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,934
But I tweeted to you,
I said,

757
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,700
"You know, the thing I hope
for Alyssa

758
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,300
"is that she can tour the world

759
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,934
"so that everyone can see
the worst dress

760
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,633
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history."</i>

761
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,233
[laughter and applause]

762
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,300
- You know, I'm sensing
a lot of sexual tension

763
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,166
between you two.

764
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,767
I mean, you guys,
I think y'all need to hook up,

765
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,567
and make this shit happen.

766
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:57,900
Y'all need to go and fuck,

767
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,967
you know what I'm saying?

768
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,266
[laughter and applause]

769
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:02,333
You two. You two.

770
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,500
[cheers and applause]

771
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,667
- Yeah!

772
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,500
- That's--that's what needs
to happen.

773
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,567
- Yeah.

774
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,233
- That's exactly
what needs to happen.

775
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:12,600
- Now, our next queen
was one of the best ever

776
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,667
in the history of<i> Drag Race.</i>

777
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:15,900
Don't believe me?

778
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,333
Just ask her.

779
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,633
Take a look.

780
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:20,667
- Wow.

781
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,767
[cheers and applause]

782
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,233
My name is Detox,
and I am 27 years old.

783
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:27,433
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?

784
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:28,567
- [laughs]

785
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,600
-<i> My tits are bouncing</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

786
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,834
<i>I have a great body,</i>
<i>so why not show it off?</i>

787
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,200
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>I haven't had done</i>

788
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,834
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.

789
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:39,066
<i>And I'm the queen bee,</i>
<i>so eat it up</i>

790
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,133
and crown it.

791
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,200
[cheers and applause]

792
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,533
- Detox, welcome!

793
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,600
Welcome, Detox.

794
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,934
All right, first question.

795
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,834
Why it gotta be gray?
- [laughs]

796
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,867
Um, well, it was a gray day
in Los Angeles

797
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,533
when I got kicked off, so--

798
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,400
- Oh, okay.
- Was it not?

799
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,500
- Yeah.

800
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,400
Now, Detox, coming into
this competition,

801
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,533
you were one fierce
and funny queen.

802
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:10,500
- I was?

803
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,100
- Yes, and now that

804
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,734
the competition's over,
girl, you still are.

805
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,066
How you feelin'?

806
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,400
- I'm feeling amazing.

807
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,300
It's been, like, the most
magical experience

808
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,467
I've ever had.

809
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,900
It's been a complete blast,

810
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,333
and the fact that I'm able
to tour the world

811
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,300
with some of my best girlfriends
and do something

812
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,834
that I love and art of drag
that I love so much

813
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:34,567
is just beyond amazing to me,
and I'm so happy and thrilled.

814
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:38,066
- I love your collaborations
with Willam and Vicky Vox.

815
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,433
Now, I heard that you were all

816
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:41,066
recently performing in Dubai.

817
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,066
- Yeah.

818
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,667
Li-li-li-li-li-li-li!

819
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,166
- Did you have to wear a burka?

820
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,433
- No, we wanted to wear burkas,

821
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,734
but then we just said
fuck it,

822
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:48,734
and we're sluts.

823
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:49,867
I mean, hello, look at Willam.

824
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,633
That's his aesthetic.

825
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,567
- Now, you were also outspoken

826
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,900
in your criticism
of some of the younger queens.

827
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,166
Do you still feel that they
treated the show as...

828
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,867
[old woman voice]
Rupaul's School for Girls?

829
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,200
- There were certain girls--

830
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,834
like, some of the larger names

831
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,400
and the people that have been
in the industry

832
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,433
for a long time

833
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:07,467
that would be torn apart

834
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,200
for doing
what they do the best,

835
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,133
whereas some of the judges
were treating them

836
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,734
as, you know, students.

837
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:15,633
Yes, you.

838
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:16,734
- Are you talking to Santino?

839
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:17,867
- I'm talking to both of 'em,

840
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,166
Santino and Michelle.

841
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,567
- Oh.
[laughs]

842
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,700
- I don't give--y'all know
I don't give two shits.

843
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,266
[laughter and cheering]

844
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,433
- Now, just between us girls...

845
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:28,433
- Mm-hmm.

846
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,734
- As a member of Rolaskatox...

847
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:30,767
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:31,934
- Who should be crowned

849
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,166
America's next drag superstar?

850
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,300
- Detox.

851
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,467
- [laughs]

852
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:40,533
[cheers and applause]

853
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,400
But--yeah, you're not eligible.

854
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,934
Oh, whatever.
- [laughs]

855
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,600
- Thanks for sharing, Detox.

856
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
Now, before I go any further,

857
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
I'd like to take this moment
to say something

858
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,166
I've actually never said
on national television before.

859
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,300
Can you bring the camera closer?

860
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,066
[laughter]

861
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:03,467
Closer.

862
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,667
Now, back the fuck up.

863
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,500
Not that close.

864
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,467
[sighs]

865
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:10,967
Okay, this is hard for me.

866
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,500
Due to the fact that her thighs

867
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,333
spread just like...

868
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,133

891
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,333
We'll be right back
with the final three, hunty.

892
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,266

898
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,200
- [laughs]

899
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,700
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>

900
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,900
And now, the reason
we're all here tonight.

901
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,300
Please welcome back
to the stages the final three.

902
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,200
Alaska.

903
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,266
Jinkx Monsoon.

904
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,834
Roxxxy Andrews.

905
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,133
Welcome, ladies.

906
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,900
You look sickening.

907
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,300
Now, I have so much
I have to ask you,

908
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,233
but first, we're gonna
take some questions

909
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:16,400
from the fans.

910
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,367
Inquiring minds want to know.

911
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:21,300
This first one here
is for Jinkx.

912
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,400
The Duchess of Dork
wants to know

913
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,066
about your crush on Ivyyyy.

914
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:29,333
"Did you guys ever hook up
after the show?"

915
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,233
- Well, when you're held
in captivity

916
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,333
in a little pink hamster cage,

917
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,800
eventually, you just look
for the cutest person

918
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,300
in the room,
and I chose Ivy Winters.

919
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,533
[laughter]

920
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,133
- You know, Ivy,
was there a love connection?

921
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,367
- I was actually shocked
when I was watching

922
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,266
the episode with my boyfriend...
- Me too.

923
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:48,734
- And he was like, "Oh."

924
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,367
- I didn't know
they were gonna air that.

925
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,433
[laughter]

926
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,700
But nothing ever came of it,
and we're actually

927
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,567
just very good friends,
you know,

928
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,767
and I've met her boyfriend,
he's very charming.

929
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:03,767
- I mean, honestly, wha--

930
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,233
I mean, really,
what's the problem?

931
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,834
I mean, triads
are really in right now.

932
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:07,967
- [laughs]

933
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,400
- And honestly,
I could see a spin-off show

934
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,433
like, you know,
<i>Drag Sister Wives</i>

935
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,567
or something like that.

936
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,700
All right, this next question
is for Alaska.

937
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,367
Oscar asks, "Do you think
being part of Rolaskatox

938
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,100
helped or hurt you?"

939
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,934
- I knew Detox
from a long time ago,

940
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:29,133
and she knew Roxxxy
from a long time ago,

941
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,767
so we were just, like,
friends,

942
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:33,633
and we needed a prescription
drug for gagging,

943
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,433
so we called it Rolaskatox.

944
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,867
- [laughs]

945
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:39,266
- I don't think it really
hurt me,

946
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:41,934
but Michelle hated it.

947
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:45,533
And she called us "Rolodex."

948
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,066
I don't even know
what a Rolodex is!

949
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:52,333
[laughter and applause]

950
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,934
- Now, Roxxxy, what about you?

951
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:56,834
Do you think it helped
or hurt you?

952
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,333
- To me, it was never,
you know,

953
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,133
"Well, I'm gonna be
on<i> Survivor</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now,"</i>

954
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:01,533
and be like,
"This is my alliance,

955
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:02,800
"and we're gonna stick together

956
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,934
and get everybody out of here."

957
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:05,233
It was never that,
so when she said

958
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,567
she wanted to go off
on her own,

959
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,100
we were like, "Girl,
we love you no matter what."

960
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,166
Like, "Go on and do your thing

961
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,667
if that's what you feel
you need to do."

962
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,867
- Jinkx, you were not
in Rolaskatox.

963
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:13,967
What are your thoughts?

964
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,567
Did you feel alienated by it?

965
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:19,734
- Well, you know, cliques
can either help or hinder you.

966
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:21,133
They can be a big distraction,

967
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,767
but even though they had
a clique, I had a mantra.

968
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,233
[laughter]

969
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,834
- Which was?

970
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:30,066
- Let's say it together,
ladies and gentlemen.

971
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,600
all: Water off a duck's back.

972
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,834
[laughter]

973
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:36,166
- Now, this next question
is for Roxxxy.

974
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,400
Gwen asks,
"Do you honestly feel

975
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,900
"that comedy drag
is insulting,

976
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,066
or was that you just playing
mind games?"

977
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:47,333
- You know, I take drag very,
very seriously,

978
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,367
and sometimes--

979
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,533
I noticed on the show--
too seriously.

980
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,867
And no, it's not insulting
at all whatsoever,

981
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:55,900
and you know,
they're my complete opposites,

982
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,233
and that's what
makes them magic,

983
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,400
and I can learn a lot
from them.

984
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,533
- All right.

985
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:05,433
Now, this next question
is from Johnny B.

986
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:06,767
This is for Alyssa.

987
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:10,233
"Have you figured out
what Alyssa's secret is yet?"

988
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,600
[laughter and cheers]

989
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,934
- Well, Johnny, if I told you,

990
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,367
it wouldn't be a secret.

991
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,467
- So is--that's a "No,
you don't know what it is"?

992
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:21,400
[laughter]

993
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,233
- It's 9 inches
and fully functional.

994
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,333
- Oh, my God!

995
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,700
[laughs]

996
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,800
[cheers and applause]

997
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,367
Not so secret anymore,
is it?

998
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:38,066
Now, this next question
is to all the queens.

999
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:41,767
Ian asks, "What motivated you
to do the show,

1000
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,066
the title or the $100,000?"

1001
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:45,700
Let's start here with Alaska.

1002
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,533
- Um, what motivated me
was the fact

1003
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:52,433
that I auditioned
for every single season

1004
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,900
and never made it,

1005
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,934
so it eventually became
a personal vendetta

1006
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,200
to get on the program.

1007
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,000
[laughter and cheers]

1008
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,133
- And what about you?

1009
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,700
- Honestly, since I was
five years old,

1010
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,967
this is what I wanted to do.
You know--

1011
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,033
- This show was on
when you were five years old?

1012
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,200
- No, I used to say--

1013
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,166
I used to watch
<i>Death Becomes Her,</i>

1014
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,533
and I knew I wanted to grow up
to be Meryl Streep.

1015
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,166
[cheers and applause]

1016
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:25,700
- All right, Roxxxy,
title or moola?

1017
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,900
- Definitely the title
and the competition.

1018
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,066
I'm a pageant girl.

1019
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,800
I like to compete,
and that was the platform

1020
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,600
to show the world
that I could be

1021
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,533
America's next drag superstar
and compete with

1022
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,934
the best of the best,
which,

1023
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,567
I think this season is the best
of the best.

1024
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,934
Nothing against the other ones.

1025
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:44,567
[laughter and jeering]

1026
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,533
- Now, you know, every year,
we ask our fans to vote

1027
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:49,700
for Miss Congeniality,
and this year,

1028
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,867
the choice was tougher
than ever.

1029
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,734
Now, to help me bestow
this honor, please welcome

1030
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,734
last year's Miss Congeniality,

1031
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,467
Latrice Royale.

1032
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:01,567
[cheers and applause]

1033
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,700
Hey, mommy.
- Hey!

1034
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,767
- Looking good.
- And feeling gorgeous, baby.

1035
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,667
- Hey.

1036
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,867
Now, Latrice, would you please
do us the honors?

1037
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:25,500
- This year's Miss Congeniality
is...

1038
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,867
[suspenseful music]

1039
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:33,200
Ivyyyyy Winters!

1040
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:42,867
- Condragulations, Ivy.

1041
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,767
You have won a six-night stay
plus airfare

1042

from Hilton Hotels and Resorts.

1044
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,200
Now, you can stay Hilton.

1045
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,100
Go out at one of their
550 locations in 80 countries.

1046
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,467
- Oh, my gosh.

1047
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:58,934
Oh, thank you guys so much.

1048
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,166
Thank you so much.

1049
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,300
I feel like I just won!

1050
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,467
Thank you, mwah.

1051
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:03,734
- All right, Ivy.

1052
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:04,967
Now, sissy that walk.

1053
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,533
Sissy that walk.

1054
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,934
[cheers and applause]

1055
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,166
- I love you.

00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,834
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>

1064
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:40,066
Now, I'm here with
our final three: Alaska...

1065
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:43,567
[cheers and applause]

1066
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:44,734
Jinkx Monsoon...

1067
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:48,700
[cheers and applause]

1068
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,700
And Roxxxy Andrews!

1069
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,800
[cheers and applause]

1070
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,100
Now, in less time
than it takes

1071
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,967
to microwave
a chicken pot pie,

1072
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,500
one of them will be crowned

1073
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,300
America's next drag superstar.

1074
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,133
Not only did these three queens

1075
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:08,266
snatch our hearts, but they
tickled our funny bones.

1076
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,734
Take a look.

1077
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:13,200
Direct from<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it's little Edie Beale.

1078
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,734
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.

1079
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:16,467
- How is big Edie doing?

1080
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,066
- She's always begging
for the pate,

1081
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:19,500
but the label is faded.

1082
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,934
I can never tell if it's pate

1083
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,567
or if it's giblets for the cats.

1084
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,133
[laughter]

1085
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:27,066
- My old, old friend,
Lady Bunny.

1086
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:29,667
- You know, the last time
I had a battle of the browns

1087
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:32,300
was about ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.

1088
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,066
[laughter]

1089
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,667
- Tamar Braxton!

1090
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,667
- Get your life.

1091
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,200
- Paula Deen is out of control.

1092
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,734
This morning, she put a stick
of butter--

1093
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:41,867
- On her--boom!

1094
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:44,066
Louboutins,
'cause her fat-ass feet

1095
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:45,300
don't fit in 'em.

1096
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,967
[laughter]

1097
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,066
Boom, boom, baby.

1098
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:49,333
Rock, rock.

1099
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,300
- [laughs]

1100
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,333
Now, Alaska, were you nervous
to play a character like

1101
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,200
Lady Bunny, who's you know,
already very funny?

1102
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,734
- I was really nervous,
'cause she's so old.

1103
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:04,467
[laughter]

1104
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:08,600
- [gasping laugh]

1105
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,467
- And I was gonna do
Michelle Obama,

1106
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:12,667
but that was already taken,
so...

1107
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,333
[laughter]

1108
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,467
- Oh!

1109
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,900
- Now, when Coco
and some of the other queens

1110
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,300
hadn't heard
of<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

1111
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,500
it caused quite the controversy
online.

1112
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,433
- Quite the scandal, really.

1113
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,266
[laughter]

1114
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:30,600
[cheers and applause]

1115
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,500
- Now, Jinkx, were you surprised
by that?

1116
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,166
- Uh--I was surprised by
America's reaction.

1117
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,066
I didn't know that many people
knew about her,

1118
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,433
but I was thrilled to see it,
you know?

1119
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:41,700
- All right.

1120
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,200
Roxxxy, now, you say you're not
a comedy queen,

1121
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,967
but your Tamar Braxton
slayed the children

1122
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,400
dot com, girl.

1123
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
- Dot com.
- Yes.

1124
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,934
- I wanted to do somebody
that I knew

1125
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,066
could be funny off the bat.

1126
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,900
Her personality
is so off-the-wall

1127
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,567
that if you didn't know her,

1128
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:57,633
you wanted to laugh at her,

1129
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,400
so that's why
I went with Tamar.

1130
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,633
I love you, Tamar.

1131
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:01,734
- Well, they say imitation

1132
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:03,767
is the sincerest form
of flattery,

1133
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,600
but sometimes, it could really
piss people off.

1134
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,066
Let's take a look.

1135
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,934
<i>The final three are so bitchy,</i>

1136
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:12,800
<i>they don't just throw shade,</i>

1137
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,734
<i>they "blank" it.</i>

1138
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,467
- Well, I don't know them
personally,

1139
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:19,200
so I said they airmail it,

1140
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,367
though that's frightfully
expensive.

1141
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,100
Hi, Jinkx, it's me, Bebe Wood
from<i> The New Normal.</i>

1142
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,266
You do the second-best
impression of little Edie.

1143
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,367
- [laughs]

1144
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:29,900
- I just know Ru's
going to make

1145
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,533
the staunch decision.
- [squeals]

1146
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,600
- Good luck,
and don't funk it up.

- [screaming laugh]

1148

-<i> Lady Bunny, same question.</i>

1149
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,367
- They throw it so hard
that it casts

1150
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:42,433
more of a shadow than
Alyssa Edwards' overbite

1151
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:45,100
on her nonexistent chin.

1152
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,400
[laughter]

1153
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,433
Alaska, I wanted to tell you

1154
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,967
that your impersonation of me
was spot on.

1155
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,400
And I'm gonna get you for that.

1156
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,934
[laughter]

1157
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:59,867
-<i> All right, Tamar Braxton!</i>

1158
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:03,500
- They do that on over-the-top
shade dot com, okay?

1159
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,333
Boom!
Get your life.

00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,400
Where my Roxxxy at?

1162
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,133
She is my queen dot com,

1163
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,700
and I know she fixin' to do me
proud, okay?

1164

I love it.

1168
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,800
Condragulations, ladies,
you're a hit.

1169
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,533
Now, ladies, it's time to get
serious.

1170
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,100
Assume the position, because I'm
about to do one final

1171

examination of your charisma,

1172
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,433
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

1173
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:38,700
I hope you showered.

1174
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,200

[laughter]

1179
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:47,633
- Now, your wicked wit

in your journey from tragic

- I know, yay.

1187
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,667

1193
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,233

I am the queen

Now, Alaska,
what has<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meant to you?</i>

1217
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,066
- It's just, like--like, I

1218

can't even believe
I'm sitting

1219
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:58,600

and all these

1220

Hi-ee!

- Now, Alaska, you're part
of a drag super couple.

1223
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,734
Now, is that a blessing
or a curse?

1224
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:10,767
- I think it's an awesome
blessing,

1225
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:16,066
because I couldn't choose
a better person who is--

1226
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:21,066
who could be so supportive
and who's always there for me

1227
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,867
and always believes in me,

1228
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:26,567
even when I don't believe
in myself.

1229
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:29,266

1237
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,500
When you look
at Alaska Thunderfuck--

1238
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,600
when I look at you right now,

1239
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,633
you have the tangible,
marketable beauty

1240
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,767
of Roxxxy Andrews

1241
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:52,300
and the campy theatrics
of Jinkx Monsoon,

1242
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
and in my heart,
you are America's

1243
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,433
next drag superstar,
and you and me

1244
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,800
will be the most famous people
in reality television

1245
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,567
from Pittsburgh, next to
Abby Lee Miller, of course.

1246
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:02,967

1247
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:06,333
[cheers and applause]

1248
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,967
- Pam, did you know that Alaska

1249
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:10,834
would grow up to be
a world-famous drag queen?

1250
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,367
- Never in a million years

1251
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,900
would I have ever dreamt
that he would've grown up

1252
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,934
to be a famous drag queen.

1253
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:19,934
I-I have four children,
I'm proud of all of them,

1254
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:22,066
and I wanted them all
to be happy.

1255
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:24,500
I have an Air Force man,
an Army man,

1256
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,633
a medical daughter,

1257
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,867
and now--
- And this.

1258
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,066
- I'm well--no!

1259
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,700
I'm so--I'm so well-rounded
with you.

1260
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,767
I love you.

1261
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:37,100
I'm so, so proud.

1262
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,433
- Now, Alaska, what would it
mean to you

1263
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:42,066
to be America's
next drag superstar?

1264
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:45,133
- [stammering]

1265
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:48,800
[laughter]

1266
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,500
I mean, it would change my life.

1267
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,133
And just being here and doing

1268
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:53,433
this experience has already

1269
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,900
changed my life, and that would

1270
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,633
just be so amazing.

1271
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:59,934
And with the money, I would buy

1272
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:02,633
100,000 slices of pizza
and share it with all of you.

1273
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,633
- Oh, yummy.

1274
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,800
- Aww.

1275
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,066
- I love pizza.

1276
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:08,233
- Me too.

1277
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,200
- Alaska, it's been a real joy

1278
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,333
to watch you blossom,

1279
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:14,133
and you walk
in no one's shadow.

1280
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:17,533
You are a force to be reckoned
with, because Alaska

1281
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:21,633
is a thunder-fucking star,
y'all!

1282
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:25,467

America's next drag superstar,

1290

I've drilled Alaska.

- What's on your head?

1296
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,367
- Just a little headpiece.

1297
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:05,533
- It's rather pedestrian.

1298
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,467
Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.

00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:09,066

I love it!

- [laughs]

1302
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:14,300
I left my youngest brother
with a woman

1303
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,233
who wasn't ready to be a mom.

1304
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:18,333
To say that
"You're just a comedy queen"

1305
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,500
is belittling something
I have made my whole career on.

1306
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,300
- Jinkx, I have--
- I am talking.

00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,333

<i>To dismiss me</i>

1310
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:30,967

- Wow.
[laughs]

1315
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:45,133
So, Jinkxy, how are you feeling
at this very moment?

1316
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,667
You're not sleepy at all,
are ya?

1317
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,667
- I-I-I could use a nap, but--

1318

1319
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,667

realized drag queen.

1321
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,300
I feel like a more fully

1322
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,100
realized human being.

1323
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,633
I remember hearing you say

1324
00:51:58,633 --> 00:51:59,834
you've been through many phases

1325
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:03,133
in your drag,
and I think I've entered

1326
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:05,834
Jinkx 2.0,
the butterfly phase.

1327
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,767

00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,500
- So tell me, what has been

1330
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,066
your proudest moment
on the show?

1331
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:18,066
- Honestly, working with Dave,
my veteran.

1332
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:19,500
[cheers and applause]

1333
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Right there.

1334
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,300
- You've been very open about
some childhood issues

1335
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,533
you had with your mother
and your brother.

1336
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:27,633
How are things now?

1337
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:30,433
- You know, things are
wonderful.

1338
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:33,100
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> kind of brought</i>
our family back together again,

1339
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,967
and it caused us to have
some really

1340
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,433
adult conversations.

1341
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:39,066
- Are they here?
Are they here tonight?

1342
00:52:39,066 --> 00:52:40,700
- He's right over there.
- Oh.

1343
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,900
- They're both there.

1344
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,567
- So, Deanne, what was it like

1345
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,900
having your Jinkxy discuss

1346
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,300
family issues on television?

1347
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,266
- Well, it hurt, mainly because

1348
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:55,233
I saw how much
I hurt my child,

1349
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:57,567
but at the same time,
it was good,

1350
00:52:57,567 --> 00:53:00,567
because it--it made--

1351
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:03,633
it helped us to become
even closer.

1352
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:05,867
- All right, yeah,
let the healing begin.

1353
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:09,233
[applause]

1354
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:10,533
Jacob, what's it like having

1355
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:12,400
a drag queen for a brother?

1356
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,600
- [chuckles]
Well, I never

1357
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,533
really thought of him
as a drag queen.

1358
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:18,533
I've just always thought of him
as my big brother,

1359
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,734
and I know he's worked
so hard,

1360
00:53:20,734 --> 00:53:22,734
and I'm so proud of him
for being here.

1361
00:53:22,734 --> 00:53:25,133
And don't forget,
it's Monsoon season.

1362
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:27,967
- [laughs]

1363
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:30,567
[cheers and applause]

1364
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:33,066
So, Jinkx, what would it mean
to you

1365
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:36,066
to become America's next
drag superstar?

1366
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:39,400
- I would love to be given
the chance

1367
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,867
to use this as a platform

1368
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:43,800
to be an advocate
for social change.

1369
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,867
I'm lucky enough to live in
Washington

1370
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:48,233
where gay marriage
is legal, and...

1371
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,233
[cheers and applause]

1372
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:51,066
I don't want to rest until

1373
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:53,266
that's the truth
for all of America.

1374
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:54,667
[laughs]

1375
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,900
- Well, Jinkx, you have
continued to surprise

1376
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,233
and delight your fans.

1377
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:01,800
Best of all, I think you've even
surprised yourself.

1378
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,767
I'm so proud to have you
sitting here tonight.

1379
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:07,633
Now, our next queen is a blast

1380
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:10,233
from drag's proud pageant
past

1381
00:54:10,233 --> 00:54:12,734
and an important part
of its future.

1382
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:14,967

1389

- Sequence dress.

1390
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,100
- "Sequin dress" I think
is what you mean.

1391
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,200
- Sequence.

1392
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,066
- What do you call it
when you flat-line?

1393
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:32,633
- You're dead.

1394
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:35,066
- I come off as a strong
character,

1395
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:37,400
but I'm so weak
at the same time!

- Oh, my God,
words cannot express

1410
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,400
how happy I am to be here
and to experience this,

1411
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,100
and y'all showing me
so much love.

1412
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,100
I love it.

1413
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,233
- Well, I know that getting

1414
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:11,700
ready for the finale, you were
very emotional.

1415
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,967
Tell me about that.

1416
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,767
- Um, some of the things
on the show that--

1417
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:17,667
how I was acting,
and I was acting that way,

1418
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,767
it got the best of me at points,
and, you know,

1419
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:21,767
I said a lot of hurtful things
to Jinkx,

1420
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:24,467
and the most important thing
to me is our relationship,

1421
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:28,066
and she is an amazing person
and she's extremely talented

1422
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:32,266
and just as good as a competitor
as I am, if not better.

1423
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:35,166
[applause]

1424
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,233
- More than ever before,
a lot of people

1425
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:41,400
have attacked you online about
how you were on the show.

1426
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,800
How has that affected you?

1427
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,133
- It's affected me a lot.

1428
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,667
You know, you want to say
you don't listen to it

1429
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,600
and you don't pay attention
to it, but when you're, like,

1430
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,567
going on social media networks,
you do run into those things,

1431
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,266
and it hurts my feelings,
and you know, I just

1432
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,734
have to pick myself back up.

1433
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:56,100
Like--you know what I'm saying?

1434
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,133
Like, you can't let it
get you down, just, you know,

1435
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:59,934
that there's people out there
who do love you

1436
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,700
and do understand where
you are coming from

1437
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,066
and have been
in that same place.

1438
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:04,900
We're all human.
We all make mistakes.

1439
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
That was completely messy,

1440
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,333
and I can't believe
I went there,

1441
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,734
but I shouldn't have done that.

1442
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:11,300
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to Jinkx right now?

1443
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,834
- I love you to death,
and regardless of the things--

1444
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:16,100
I wrote her, and I've written
you and I've told you that,

1445
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,800
you know, I love you.
- And called me personally.

1446
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,934
- And regardless if I win, lose,
or draw this contest,

1447
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:22,500
she's somebody that I want
in my life

1448
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,633
for the rest of my life,

1449
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:27,200
and I have learned so much
from her and Alaska.

1450
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,200
- Now, Jinkx, is there anything
you'd like to say to Roxxxy?

1451
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,700
- I think people forget
sometimes that even though

1452
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,700
sisters love each other,
sisters can also get

1453
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,567
into some pretty bad fights,
you know?

1454
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,934
But through all of it,
we're sisters.

1455
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:44,333
- I think you two hookers
should hug it out.

1456
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,066
[laughter]

1457
00:56:46,066 --> 00:56:47,100
[cheers and applause]

1458
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,767
- [laughs]

1459
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:49,967
- Okay.
[laughs]

1460
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:52,233
- And if I may, I think
you're both awful.

1461
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:56,300
[laughter]

1462
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,433
[cheers and applause]

1463
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:02,867
- Sadly, your legendary
drag mother Erica Andrews

1464
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:04,533
recently passed away.

1465
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,133
Did she get to see the show?

1466
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:10,467
- She was at the hospital,
and she was texting me,

1467
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:13,100
and she was telling me,
um, how proud she was of me

1468
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,300
and, you know, she got to see
at least two episodes,

1469
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,967
and then she ended up passing.

1470
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,100
She was a wonderful person,

1471
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,400
and if you ever got to meet her,

1472
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,800
you knew exactly...

1473
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,600
How beautiful she was, and...

1474
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,066
[sniffs]

1475
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,734
The hardest thing was during
rehearsal yesterday.

1476
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:29,700
I had a little breakdown.

1477
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,166
Those were the times
I would call her

1478
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,800
and she would know exactly
what to tell me,

1479
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,934
and I didn't have her to call
yesterday,

1480
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:38,567
but my heart always tells me
what she would say,

1481
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:40,633
and I knew inside,
she was just,

1482
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:42,767
"Pick yourself up,
show them how beautiful

1483
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,433
"you can be inside and out,
and...

1484
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:47,300
walk with your head
held high."

1485
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,734
- That's right. I love it.

1486
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,066
I got to tell you,
you are my child now.

1487
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:55,166
We, as gay people,
like I said before,

1488
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:56,867
we get to choose the families.

1489
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:59,867
We create families on our own
on this journey,

1490
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:02,600
and all of my girls--you--
all of the girls

1491
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,900
on this stage and the girls
in the audience,

1492
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,467
we are one big, happy family,
and we will all be

1493
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:09,834
there for one another.

1494
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,767
Promises? Okay.

1495
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,600

America's next drag superstar.

1513
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:03,300
Now, if, for any reason,

Too much?

1518
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,834
Is it--was it too soon
for that joke?

1519
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:19,200
- No!
- No!

1520
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,467
- Now, I want to give
a shout-out

- Yes.

- Any last words?

1527
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,567
- Your sequence brocog gown
is real "eloguent."

1528

- [laughs]
- Yes.

1529

00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:43,900
both: Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

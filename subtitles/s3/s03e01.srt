00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,700

little girls.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,266
- And we'll take a sneak peek

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,266
at the top 12 queens'
audition tapes.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,100

naked.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,834
- Plus unforgettable footage

8
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:23,934
of some of the ladyboys
who didn't quite make the cut.

9
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,467
- I'm keeping my baby.

10
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:27,934
- Can I get an "amen"?

11
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,400
- Heer neer.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,800
- And just when you thought

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,266
it was safe to go outside...

14
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,667

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,567
- Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill?

22
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:55,133
- And more lip-syncing for
your life than ever before.

23
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,567
- Top that, J.Lo.

24
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:00,066

pit crew auditions

25
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:03,633

we scour the nation

42
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,834

74
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,834
- Hello,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

75
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,100
My name is Andrew Levitt.

76
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,367
I grew up in Canton, Ohio,

77
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,367
which is the Pro Football
Hall of Fame capital.

78
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,066
Then I moved--

79
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,367
- I am the fierce diva

80
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,867
that is going to end up
ruling this country.

81
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,266
- I'm in my car.

82
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,166
That just tells you I'm ready
for the race, doesn't it?

83
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,700
- I'm gonna stop you right now

84
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,533
and tell you that if you do not
cast me, this show's gonna suck.

85
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:35,200
- Ru, you need somebody
interesting on your show.

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,900
- So get me on the show,

true except for one thing!

Because let me tell you
about a drag race.

105
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,166
This bitch knows how to run.

106
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,533
Can I get an "amen"?

107
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,834
- Amen.

- Is that it?
Did we get it?

111
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,400
Amen.

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,433
- Those queens ain't too proud
to beg,

113
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:50,100
and I applaud them for their
shameless self-promotion.

114
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,367
Oh, did I mention my book,
<i>Workin' It!</i>

115
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>RuPaul's Guide</i>
<i>to Life, Liberty,</i>

117
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
I didn't think so.
[ding!]

118
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,166
Now, speaking of selling
themselves,

119
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,834
these next two queens
sold me on the fact

120
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,700
that they were the best
of the best.

121
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,100
So let me introduce the first
queen chosen to compete

122
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,333
in this season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

123
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,767
From New York City,
Manila Luzon.

124
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:22,066
- Hi, my name's Karl with a K,
not a C.

125
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,834
Hi. I'm Manila.

126
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:25,934
The thing that I have

127
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,400
that you haven't seen
on your show yet

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,300
is that I'm Asian
and I'm taller than 5'2".

129
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,567
I'm Filipino.

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,300
Well, my mother's Filipino.
My dad's white.

131
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,433
So I'm a mix.

132
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,934
The Philippines
is the birthplace

133
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:42,066
of the prison<i> Thriller</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video</i>

134
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:46,734
and famous for the former
first lady Imelda Marcos.

135
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:53,100
- My favorite song to perform,
I think, of all times is<i> Vogue.</i>

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,934
I actually like
performing it better

137
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,467
as just, like me

138
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,266
and, like, picking out
fashionable clothes

139
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,633
and voguing.

140
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,767
My category is face.

141
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,300
- I have a famous boyfriend.
He's on TV.

142
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,066
You guys might know him
by the name Sahara Davenport.

143
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,567
both: Hi!

144
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,233
- Hey, there, it's me, Sahara,

145
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,066
wishing my baby girl, Manila,
all the best of luck.

146
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,900
And you guys better pick her.

147
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:24,934
- Looks like Manila's
gonna be a thriller.

148
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,100
The next queen to be competing
this season

149
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
is from the Garden State,

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,100
New Jersey's own Carmen Carrera.

151
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,734
- Yo, what's up?
This is me, Chris.

152
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:36,367
And I want to audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

153
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,266
Carmen Carrera is this, like,
fly-ass, glamorous girl.

154
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,500
She just has no worries.

155
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,633
I really, really like to be
naked

156
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:49,367
and just make costumes
out of unordinary things.

157
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,200
The animal-print pasties
with the mohawk,

158
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,066
that's, like, really Carmen.

159
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,667
Like, Carmen likes to be
really naked.

160
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,734
This is my drag closet.

161
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:02,400
Couple of sexy things,
skirt that I made.

162
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,066
Rhinestone.

163
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,533
My shoes.

164
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,266
I got married last year.

165
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,500
Me and my husband were
extremely happy about that.

166
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,266
He has a four-year-old daughter,

167
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,700
so I'm kind of, like,
stepmother.

168
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,633
I'm going to give you guys
a little runway,

169
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,800
stop some traffic.

170
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,867
Doing drag and performing
is important to me

171
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,100
on a personal level,
because it helps me grow

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,333
as an individual
and as an artist.

173
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:32,667
[RuPaul's<i> Jealous Of My Boogie]</i>

174
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,300
I can perform for people

175
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,633
and have them take something
from my show,

176
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:40,834
whether it's happiness
or whether it's inspiration.

177
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,333
I really appreciate your time,

178
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,433
and I hope to hear back soon,
all right?

179
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,266
Amen.
[clicks tongue]

180
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,433
- Like a prayer, this Jersey
girl will take you there.

181
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:53,467
Now, this might surprise you,
but many of the queens

182
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:56,767
that auditioned
are still in the closet.

183
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,066
It's true.

184
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,834
Of course, they're just in there

185
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:02,900
playing with dresses and wigs
and pantyhose.

186
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,166
And lucky for you, they invited
us in to take a look.

187
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,867
- I'm gonna show you my closet.

188
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,934
Take a look.

189
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,200
- This is my closet.

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,533
I'm gonna take you on a tour.

191
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,700
I have named it
The Interior Illusions Lounge.

192
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,467
- I spend a lot of money
on drag to look cheap, honey,

193
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,900
and I don't need any other bitch
to take it from me.

194
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,433
So, yes, it's a double lock,
as you can see.

195
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:30,934
- I'm about to show you
Joaya's fierce closet.

196
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:34,300
So here it is.

197
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,600
This is pretty much her closet.

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
- Drag closet, drag closet.

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,367
Come on. Let's go.

200
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,800
Everything that I have--
my house is so small

201
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,900
that I have to hide it
under the house.

202
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
- This is my special closet.

203
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,934
It's my freezer.

204
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,700
- Some people say garage.
I say closet.

205
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,166
- There she is.

206
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,700
- I don't wear
99% of this stuff.

207
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,967
- I wear this to all
the appropriate events,

208
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,834
like family functions, dinners.

209
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,100
- Oh, and listen to it.

210
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,467
[dress rustling]

211
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,900
Merry Christmas.

212
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,967
- Everybody should have

213
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,233
at least one good
straightjacket.

214
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,467
- I go from different looks.

215
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,934
You know, sometimes I'm demure.

216
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,066
Sometimes I'm classy.

217
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,533
Most of the time, I'm whorey.

218
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,667
- This is my closet in all
its--oh, we have bras.

219
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,333
Am I supposed to show this?

220
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:26,100
- Little bit of cheetah,
leopard, and my zebra.

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,066
But one thing you'll never find
on me is beaver.

222
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,233
- I have developed
quite an affinity

223
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,133
for gluing shit
to other shit.

224
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:39,166
- And then this is my
Space Girl Goes Green.

225
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,300
She, you know--
she a little scandalous.

226
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,266
- This is my alien space queen
outfit.

227
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,834
I hope you like it.

228
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,433
I am a natural green hair.

229
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,233
- This right here

230
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,533
is a lovely feather boa

231
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,633
made out of...

232
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,467
scented trash bags.

233
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:57,867
- And right here is where I make

234
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:00,767
my own theatrical rhinestone
jewelry.

235
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:07,066
- Those are some true
fashion plates.

236
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,800
The first time a man puts on
a wig, some makeup,

237
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,934
and a pair of heels,
and prances out that door

238
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,500
is the ultimate act of courage.

239
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Many of our hopefuls told us
about their first time in drag.

240
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,467
- When I first started
doing drag,

241
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:26,467
I looked like a five-cent
prostitute clown.

242
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,100
- I started, you know,
a zesty mess in a dirty dress,

243
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,333
like everybody.

244
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,367
You know, my best girlfriend
would do my makeup,

245
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,300
and I'd put on a flat wig
and clothes from the body shop,

246
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,567
and I thought I was real.

247
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,233
And I thought, "Oh, my god,
it's just like prom

248
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,400
but every night."

249
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,867
- I started doing drag,
actually, on Halloween.

250
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,800
And if you would have asked me
back then

251
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,900
if I was gonna be a full-out
drag queen,

252
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,800
my answer definitely
would have been no.

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,900
- I was kind of a mess,
you know.

254
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,233
I was walking around.

255
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,400
I was, like--I had that wig on,

256
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,300
and I was roll around,
"Ho ho ho ho."

257
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
- I decided I was gonna dress up
as Liza Minnelli

258
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,900
just for one time, and I'm never
gonna do it again.

259
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,533
Shockingly enough,
I had so much fun,

260
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,467
from that point forward,
I knew that I was going to

261
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,300
become the drag queen
that I am today.

262
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,066
- I started doing drag
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

263
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,533
There was a competition

264
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,467
for people who had never
did drag before.

265
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,633
And all my friends were like,
"You should do it."

266
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,934
I'm, like, "I'm not
a drag queen," you know.

267
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:21,066
So I came in, did that
competition, and won

268
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,300
and beat, like, nine girls.

269
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,767
Like, they say
that I was the girl

270
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,166
that came bucking at the gate.

271
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,900
Like, it was just my calling.

272
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,300
- I used to photograph
drag queens in L.A.

273
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,100
for about a year and a half.

274
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,567
I was just like, "You know what?

275
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,867
"I'm tired of taking pictures
of drag queens.

276
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:38,433
"I'm going to turn the camera
and the spotlight onto me,

277
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,834
and I'm going
to make it happen."

278
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,700
I started off in this one
little bar in the Castro.

279
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,834
I called all my friends.

280
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,533
I was like, "Bitches, you guys
better be there.

281
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,233
"And even if I suck,
I don't give a shit;

282
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,800
"your asses are gonna scream

283
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,400
like you had just seen Madonna
poop on herself."

284
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
- When I was in college,
I was dating a man

285
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,467
who said he'd never sleep
with me again

286
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,300
if he ever saw me in drag.

287
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,867
This devastated me.

288
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,066
But I was answering
to a higher power

289
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,767
the night I picked up the flyer

290
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,600
for Chi Chi Larue's
fishbowl contest.

291
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
And you know what?

292
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,266
I walked away
with that fishbowl trophy

293
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:10,066
and a cash prize.

294
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,400
- Those queens have nerve.

295
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,300
And it do take nerve.

296
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,967
Now, here are two queens who
are ready to let you have it.

297
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,333
A professional makeup artist

298
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,200
who's worked with
some very big names.

299
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,500
Meet Raja.

300
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,934
- My drag character
or my drag name is Raja.

301
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,333
I'll be 36.

302
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,367
I'm a makeup artist,
and I'm a female impersonator.

303
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,834
I'm gonna sound
really fucking old,

304
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,266
but I started really young,

305
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,200
and I've been doing this
for about 20 years now.

306
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,834
As soon as I came out
of the closet, I was like,

307
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,567
"I'm gonna be
a fierce fucking bitch."

308
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,133
So my brows were tweezed.

309
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,300
My hair grew.

310
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,100
I kept my weight
at a certain weight.

311
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,367
I wanted to be a supermodel.

312
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,700
That's all I wanted to be.

313
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,400
I've always known
in the back of my mind

314
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,266
that there's something better
about me than everybody else.

315
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,967
I think I have
a different insight

316
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,066
and an understanding of
the world.

317
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:59,066
Raja is a jet-setting,
avant-garde supermodel.

318
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,266
She's a little boisterous,

319
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,200
but at the same time,
she's very classy.

320
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,533
We're about to explore
my closet.

321
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,967
Definitely have to be thin.

322
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,900
No fat girls allowed.

323
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,066
[chuckles]

324
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,200
So this is one of the pieces
that I made.

325
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,867
Not bad, right?

326
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,600
Sometimes I go have coffee
in the morning down the street

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,133
and I go down through
West Hollywood,

328
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,233
go to the thrift shop
in this gown.

329
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,433
I've been watching<i> Drag Race,</i>
and I'm frankly disappointed

330
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,300
at the collection that these...
men are wearing.

331
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,633
They don't have shit
like this.

332
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,300
I watch them, and they're just
walking around

333
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,066
in their, you know,
home sewing machine, like,

334
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,400
cheap Lycra nonsense.

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,667
And, frankly,
I don't understand it,

336
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,200
and I think it's irresponsible,

337
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,066
and I think they need
to get it together.

338
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,433
I'm a makeup artist.
That's what I do.

339
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,066
And I work with a ton of
celebrities.

340
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,567
This is my friend Adam Lambert.

341
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,700
So what do you think about me,

342
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,767
like, trying to become
the next top drag queen?

343
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,567
- You are the top drag queen.
- Oh!

344
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,900
- Those bitches
better look out.

345
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,500
- There you go.
Enough said.

346
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,066
- You're going to kick
their ass.

347
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,133
- Sorry about that.

348
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,066
- Not only is Raja
the prettiest queen;

349
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,400
she's also the most creative
and resourceful

350
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,100
and [speaking indistinctly].

351
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,300
- To me, drag is an art form
and it's a visual art.

352
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,967
And so the more visual it is,

353
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,600
the more powerful it is
and the more important it is.

354
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,900
- This drag veteran
is ready for the race.

355
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,400
You go, mama.

356
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,934
Here's a diva supreme

357
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:21,700
who comes to<i> Drag Race</i>
with a daunting reputation.

358
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,400
From the Buckeye State,
meet India Farrah.

359
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,266
- My name is Shane Richardson.

360
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,934
I started drag
at a very young age,

361
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,400
at the age of 12, actually.

362
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,633
And my brother,
whom is also gay,

363
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:36,166
was currently in a relationship
with a drag queen

364
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,066
in my hometown,
who got me started in drag

365
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,600
and gave me the drag name
India Farrah.

366
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,967
Oh, hello.

367
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,500
When did you get here?

368
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,467
No, it's not Kris Kardashian.

369
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,300
It's me, India Farrah.

370
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,433
I started performing
at the age of 14.

371
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:53,300
There's been some hardships
that I've had to face.

372
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,333
A lot of people actually tried
to bring me down

373
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166
when I was younger,
because I started so young.

374
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,333
And luckily, with the support of
my family and close friends,

375
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,734
it was a battle that I overcame.

376
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,333
This is my closet,

377
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,066
and I want you to come in
and take a look with me.

378
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:11,800
This right here is a new wig
that I just created, actually,

379
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
and it weighs about 20 pounds.

380
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,166
This is a little fabric boa
that I made.

381
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,233
Makeup, lashes.

382
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,967
I like to keep stock of stuff.

383
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,233
One of my top hats for Rihanna.

384
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,600
This right here
is my galaxy costume,

385
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,633
and I absolutely love it.

386
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,700
[fast-paced music]

387
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,967
Why is drag an important part
of my life?

388
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,066
I would have to say since I was
homeschooled since second grade

389
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,734
by my parents,
that drag allowed me

390
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,767
to be more social and outgoing.

391
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,066
So I think, honestly, drag
helped me out a lot.

392
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,633
And I think that's why I click
to it so much.

for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

398
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,100
I hope to be seeing you
at the starting line soon.

399
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,333
Can I get an "amen"?

400
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,500
- This dancing queen is gonna
bring the heat to the runway.

401
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,633
You know, my ladyboys aren't
the only ones who have to prove

402
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,600
they've got the right stuff.

403
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,066
I put potential pit crew
candidates

404
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,567
through their paces too.

405
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:18,600
And trust me; it was grueling.

406
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,233
- My name is Patrick Cronen.

407
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,767
I'm 27.

408
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,200
I did swing for eight years,

409
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,934
but primarily dancing
in the mirror

410
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,433
is how I occupy
my spare time these days.

411
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,300
- I would have to say
I like my stomach the best,

412
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,066
'cause I put the most work
on that.

413
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,500
- I played football for the
University of South Dakota

414
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,767
for five years.

415
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm an actor/model, and I can't
dance worth shit.

416
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
- I sew, I paint,

417
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,433
and I do an amazing one-handed
hand stand

418
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,867
while humping the wall.

419
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,300
[chuckles]

420
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,066
- I'm a musical theater actor
and dancer.

421
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:52,233
I'm the biggest pussy
you will ever meet.

422
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:55,467
I cry at everything.

423
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,133
I got a nice butt.
It's big.

425
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,266
- I'm very confident.

I have some Tom Cruise moves.

427
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,700
You need to get ready, actually.

428
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,066
- I do cry at movies.

429
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,233
I'm very emotional.

430
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,166
And I think I'm a good dancer.

431
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,066
Yeah, got a great ass, so...

432
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,066
[laughs]

433
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,600
- I'm a ex-go-go dancer.

434
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,066
My favorite part of my body is
my ding-dong.

[elephant trumpets]

436
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,233
- I'm actually not a dancer
at all.

437
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,266
- So the one thing you probably
would not know about me

438
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,700
is that I can be very buff.

439
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,166
I can look like I'm really
cut up and really ready to go.

440
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,367
But I can also get really skinny
very quickly.

441
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:32,133
- I have in my blood
the mighty DNA of God.

442
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,400
So I have his blessing.

443
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,934
I can do it all.

444
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:38,133
both: We are from Russia.

445
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,066
- My age is 21.

446
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,066
- And I'm 18.

447
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,300
Sometimes we dance
in the shower.

448
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,867
- My name is Alien Hanson.

449
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,967
I'm the world's best dancer.

[cymbal crashes]

451
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,667
My career goals are to be famous

452
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:59,767
and to be a household name
on everybody's TV screen.

453
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,533
- The economy's turned terrible,
as we all well know,

454
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:06,533
and I turned to male escorting
to put bread on the table,

455
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,533
to feed my family,
and keep the women happy.

456
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:13,333
I was a<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model,</i><i> </i>
<i>Penthouse</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model for years.</i>

457
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,834
- Yeah, I'm probably a little
too short to be a model.

458
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,734
- You know, everyone sees
my chest,

459
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,967
and it just drowns
everything out, so...

460
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,133
See a little bit of that?

461
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,133
[laughs]

462
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,300

I'm 31 years old.

464

I work in outdoor advertising.

465
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,600
My favorite part about my body,
I guess, would be my midsection.

466

[laughs]

467
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,800
- My favorite aspect of my body
would have to be my abs.

468
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,300
- I love my chest.
That's all.

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,133

on my ass, though.

I am a dancer/radio jockey/

That's what I do for a living.

474
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,533
What I like best about my body
is my abs.

475

- Do you see how I suffer
to bring you this show?

476
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,633
You can thank you me later.

477
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:06,600
Actually, you can thank me now,

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,233

from plus-sized ladies.

483
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,533
Let me just say,
the bigger the cushion,

484
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:27,400
the better the...drag queen.

485
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,734

with all the big girls

that have been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

487
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,166
A big girl can't make it past
the first or second episode.

488
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,967
- I'm 6'7" flat-footed,
7'2" in heels.

I wear size 17 shoe.

And I dance like I'm little.
[laughs]

491
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,066
- Initially,
when I first started drag,

492
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:48,467
I was always too big
or I was always a booger

493
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,900
or I was not feminine enough

494
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,400
or not this enough
or not that enough.

495
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,333
- My butt goes up and down
on the scale and everything.

496
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,967
But a girl doesn't have to pad.

497
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,500
- You know, I was always
the fat kid,

498
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,900
and drag just gave me confidence
to be ballsy, brash,

499
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,800
kind of like a Mae West.

500
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
- I make fun of myself.

501
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,433
I don't want to make fun
of other people.

502
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,467
Yeah, I'm a bigger guy.

503
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,066
I'm a bigger drag queen,
a bigger girl.

504
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,000
But I have a lot of fun.

505
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,467
- Unfortunately, those zaftig
queens didn't make the cut.

506
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,734
But here are two delicious dames
who did.

507
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,433
This next queen
will not be ignored.

508
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,066
Joining the competition,

00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:30,700
it's my pleasure to introduce
Mimi Imfurst.

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,500
- Hey, everybody,

and I'm the fat bitch
you're looking for.

You need to put a fat bitch

00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,400
who's gonna tell it
like it is.

515
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,834
You need to put a fat bitch
on the show like me,

516
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,633
who's gonna deliver,
'cause I'm sick and tired

517
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:51,934
of messy fat girls
misrepresenting the big girls.

518
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,867
Honey, I'm gonna come in.

519
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,633
I'm gonna squash
the competition.

520
00:20:56,633 --> 00:21:00,400
I don't care
if you're skinny or fat.

521
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,133
I know how to win.

522
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,967
I'm gorgeous, I'm glamorous,

523
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,500
and I'm semi-retarded,

524
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,066
and that is the advantage
that I need to take over

525
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,633
and be America's next
drag superstar.

526
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,834
All my drag is big

527
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,900
and glamorous and super campy
and smart.

528
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,133
And most importantly, I'm a
fierce motherfucking lip-syncer.

529
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,867
This is my fabulous closet.

530
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,367
As you can see, there are wigs
and dresses.

531
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:30,500
Lots of ruffles and sequins
and feathers.

532
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,667
Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill to make this?

533
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,900
I didn't make this one,

534
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,500
but I have Asian slaves
in Thailand who did.

535
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,834
- ♪<i> Hey, deejay, love the way ♪</i>

536
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:45,233
♪<i> I lose my inhibitions</i>
<i>when you spin ♪</i>

537
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,967
- What I love about doing drag
is that it's empowering,

538
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,600
is that it allows you to be
anything that you want to be,

539
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,867
that you can take
what you were born with from God

540
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:59,900
and transform it
into whatever you can dream.

541
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,667
- We'll see if Mimi has
what it takes to finish first.

542
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,533
Bow down for our next queen.

543
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:13,300
From Back Swamp, North Carolina,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.

544
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,066
- Hello?

545
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,734
Oh, what's up, RuPaul?

546
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:20,066
It's me, Ron Jones.

547
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,133
Give me a second.
I'll be right out.

548
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm gonna show you a little
glimpse into my life.

549
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,066
My drag persona
is Stacy Matthews.

550
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,734
She's vivacious.

551
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,700
She's large and in charge.

552
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,166
So being a big girl,
don't let anybody ever tell you

553
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,633
that you cannot do the things
that small girls can do,

554
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,066
because I've done it all.

555
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,734
I would say
my life as a drag queen

556
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:45,800
has been the most fabulous thing
I've ever experienced.

557
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,500
I've been doing drag now
for about nine years.

558
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,133
Being a plus-sized queen,
it's not always easy

559
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,100
to have the confidence
that you need,

560
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,467
especially living where I live.

561
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,967
I am from the deep South.

562
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,433
This is my closet.

563
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:01,166
I want to show you a few things
that I've been working on.

564
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,800
Here are some of my shoes
that I do wear.

565
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,467
We've got this...flower gown.

566
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,700
You see that fringe, girl?

567
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,100
- ♪<i> Hey, deejay, love the way ♪</i>

568
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,266
♪<i> I lose my inhibitions</i>
<i>when you spin ♪</i>

569
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,767
♪<i> And I don't care</i>
<i>if people stare ♪</i>

570
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,400
♪<i> I'd rather boogie</i>
<i>than try to fit in ♪</i>

571
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,567
- Being in the Bible Belt,

572
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:30,700
people around here
look down on people like us,

573
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,867
because they don't
understand it.

574
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:36,266
So I do not feel upset or angry
at those people.

575
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:41,200
It's my job as a queen to
show them that we're people too

576
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,066
and we deserve respect.

577
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:46,266
- This country queen is busting
out of Back Swamp

578
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,967
and coming for the crown.

579
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,900
Let's hear from some of
the other hopefuls

580
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,500
to find out what inspired them
to do drag.

581
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,633
It's a little package
I like to call

582
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:58,734
"everything you wanted to know
about being a ladyboy

583
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,467
but were afraid to ask."

584
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,433
- This is my calling, and this
is what I'm supposed to do.

585
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,500
- I could have never anticipated

586
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,934
all the people
that I would meet

587
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,900
or the places that I would
travel to.

588
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,767
- In my charity work,
I've raised almost $200,000.

589
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:15,734
- Doing drag, to me, means
escaping the everyday life.

590
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,266
- Drag enables me to be
a supersonic version

591
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,300
of who I am on the inside.

592
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,600
- I don't want to be a woman.

593
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,166
I just want to dress up
and have fun.

594
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:27,300
- Drag, for me, gives me that
courage and that fearlessness.

595
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,500
- You can wrap people
around your little finger,

596
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
and they can't say a word.

597
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,300
- For me, drag is like therapy.

598
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,800
And so I don't have to pay
a therapist.

599
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,633
- Drag, for me, was an art form

600
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,667
that I can actually hide
all of my feelings behind,

601
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,400
from all the name callings

602
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,100
or just the word "faggot"
in general.

603
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
- I am not a gay man.

604
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,433
I'm a straight man

605
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:51,233
that performs in drag
for entertainment.

606
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,667
- When I was 19, my mother
kicked me out of the house.

607
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:59,300
By doing drag, I was able to
eat, to dress myself,

608
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,967
to go out shopping.

609
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,467
- I have two younger sisters.

610
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,300
They saw me perform
for the first time,

611
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,133
one of the best things that's
happened to me when performing,

612
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,233
because I really love
performing.

613
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:12,600
- I've done everything.

614
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,166
I've worked in Lower Manhattan,
the financial district,

615
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,166
for six months.

616
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,834
I've sold sunglasses
at the mall.

617
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:21,066
I've even been a contestant
on<i> Showtime at the Apollo.</i>

618
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,400
But nothing comes close
to the satisfaction that I get

619
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,867
from doing drag.

620
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,200
- A drag queen
is a true artist,

621
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
and her body is the canvas.

622
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,166
As many queens showed
in their audition tapes,

623
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:36,500
their face painting is nothing
short of a masterpiece.

624
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,867
Eat your heart out,
Michelangelo.

625
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,467
Raa!

626
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:44,066
- I put some Elmer's glue stick
over my eyebrows.

627
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:48,200
And I'm just gonna give you
a very pretty fishy lady face.

628
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,333
Aren't I gorgeous?

629
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,500
Don't you want to do me?

630
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,600
[kisses]

631
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,266
- First of all, it takes me
a good shower.

632
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:57,400
You must wash that ass
before you get in drag.

633
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
- I always do my makeup.

634
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,367
Normally, I take a good hour,
like, on my face.

635
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,066
And I'll put on
a really cute outfit.

636
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,467
When I walk into the bar,
I'm ready to perform.

637
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:10,266
- Now I'd like to show you
what it takes to become Versace.

638
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:14,333
So undergarments are an
extremely important accessory

639
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,633
for a drag queen.

640
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:17,500
I like to take in my waist
even further

641
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,900
with a cincher like this one.

642
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,567
And this is not my real ass,

643
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,133
but I did pay for it.

644
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:27,400
- This is what it takes to
transform into Jackie

645
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,333
along with a--with a nice big
roll of duct tape,

646
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,433
and we're all good.

647
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,667
And some couch cushion.

648
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,834
'cause you know
I'm a white girl,

649
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,333
so I got to put the curve in it.

650
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,166
- Can I get a "amen" up in here?

651
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,367
- Speaking of stunning
transformations,

652
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,834
the next two queens
competing this season

653
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,233
are masters of illusion.

654
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,333
First this high-energy queen

655
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,433
could give the Energizer bunny
a run for her money.

656
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:57,533
From the isle of Puerto Rico,
Miss Yara Sofia.

657
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,700
- I'm Gaby, a.k.a. Yara Sofia.

658
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,133
I'm from Puerto Rico.

659
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:05,066
I was born and raised here
in this beautiful island.

660
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:08,333
My character's name come
from a girl that I have

661
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,600
in high school.

662
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,333
She had beautiful legs.

663
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:15,133
So everybody told me
that I have beautiful legs,

664
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,467
and that's why I'm Yara Sofia.

665
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:22,266
When I look in the mirror,
I wasn't boy.

666
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:27,800
I was a girl,
'cause I love being a girl.

667
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,233
Now we're gonna talk fashion.

668
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,066
I have too many looks.

669
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:37,066
This one is a remake
from Alexander McQueen.

670
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,900
I could never forget the shoes.

671
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,500
What Yara Sofia loves to wear,
the animal print,

672
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,066
'cause I love animals.

673
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,567
I'm a fierce bitch.

674
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,066
- ♪<i> Don't be jealous</i>
<i>of my boogie ♪</i>

675
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,967
♪<i> Don't be jealous</i>
<i>of my boogie ♪</i>

676
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,800
♪<i> You can say that you are not,</i>
<i>but I always see you lookin' ♪</i>

677
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,367
- I want to compete
in this fabulous race,

678
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,700
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

679
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,133
So here I am.

680
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,867
This is the time.

681
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:07,300
The third time is the time,

682
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,834
'cause after Jessica Wild,

683
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:13,600
the Puerto Rican girl
will win this race,

684
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,900
this competition.

685
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,367
It's for us.

686
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,900
So be prepared and watch me.

687
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:24,700
- Will Yara's edgy style
get her to the finish line?

688
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
<i>Escandalo.</i>

689
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,900
This next queen impressed me
with her professionalism,

690
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,767
not to mention she put the "hot"
in Hotlanta.

691
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:39,433
It's my pleasure to introduce
Phoenix.

692
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:43,367
- Hi, my name is Brian Trapp,
also known as Phoenix.

693
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,066
Hi,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

694
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:47,233
Phoenix here
in Atlanta, Georgia.

695
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,834
I started drag, like,
ten years ago.

696
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,133
I kind of started doing these
little, like, amateur contests

697
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,667
and started winning.

698
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:58,600
And I kind of just got pushed
into the scene, and here I am.

699
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,633
The biggest hardship
is the boys.

700
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,533
The boys are crazy with it.

701
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,667
Like this year alone, I've had
this happen several times.

702
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:10,667
I'll have a guy, like,
all into me as Brian,

703
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,266
and then they figure out
what I do,

704
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,400
and it just completely changes.

705
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,433
It, like--
and it drives me insane.

706
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:21,166
I just look at me doing drag
as more of another way

707
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,667
for me to be creative
and be an artist.

708
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,967
I don't really consider myself
just a normal drag queen.

709
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,300
I look at myself as more like
an entertainer.

710
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,333
- ♪<i> Hey, deejay, love the way ♪</i>

711
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:38,066
♪<i> I lose my inhibitions</i>
<i>when you spin ♪</i>

712
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:42,500
- I've pretty much been
a full-time entertainer,

713
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,800
and now I work six days a week.

714
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,300
I have one day off a week.

715
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,133
But I'm ready to do
something different,

716
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,467
and I really think,

717
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,700
from what I've seen
with<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

718
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,633
it gives you a larger scale
to work with.

719
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,400
Bye.

720
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,367
- Rising from the ashes,

721
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:03,967
Phoenix is ready
to burn it down.

722
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,500
Now, that's my kind of queen.

723
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,066
For the very first time,
we held open auditions

724
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,934
on Hollywood Boulevard.

725
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:14,667

joined me,

727
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,867
and we got to meet
some very colorful characters.

728
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,700
- Let me get in on your shot,
girl.

729
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,767
I'm sorry, girl.

730
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,266
- Let me in there!

731

732
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,266
- My name is Delta Work.

733
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,367
I'm from Norwalk, California.

734

And I'm here to try out

735
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,033
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.

736
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,367
I'm so excited.

737
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,867
I put my tape together
the day before the deadline.

738
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,633
I rushed it.
I was ready to go.

739
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,700
The waiting's over, and I'm
ready to take it to the top.

740
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,767
- You ain't gonna do nothing.

741
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,000

I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

745
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,734
I think what sets me apart
from all the other drag queens

746
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,133
is that I'm unique,

747
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,133
I'm professional,

748
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,000
and I like to get
the shit done.

749
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,066
- Hello, world.

I'm America's next
drag superstar,

752
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,934
'cause I have the fucking gall,
the talent, the nerve.

753
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,800
- I'm America's next drag
superstar,

754
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,066
because I am a superstar.

755
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,834
- I'll cut some bitches
if I have to.

756
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,066
I'll do whatever I have to do.

757
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,567
- I'm not worried at all
about the competition.

758
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,667
Bring it on.

759
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,700
I've dealt with a lot
of shady queens.

760
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,967
I'm ready, RuPaul.

761
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,233

if you were me?

Bring it home to mama.

777
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,333
- I feel like a fake
Barbie right now, to be honest,

778
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,600
the way I'm talking.

779

Do I sound like a Barbie to you?

- Do you cross-dress for less?

818

'cause I got more to cover.

Hopefully, overall, the thing
that runs through it all

is just entertainment.

I'm giving, like, Cyndi Lauper,
Judy Jetson.

859
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,266
- Who do you pattern yourself
after?

860
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:43,533
- Madonna, Grace Jones,
Barbra Streisand.

861
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:44,967
Madonna just shocked people,

862
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,400
and that's me as a performer.

863
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
- How long have you been
performing?

864
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,567
- Almost ten years, and I'm 26.

865
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,367
- Oh, my goodness.
- Wow.

866
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,066
- Jailbait queen. Brilliant.

867
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,333
- Thank you.

868
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,533
- I tell you what.

869
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:58,233
Let's take a look
at your lip-sync prowess.

870
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,200
Are you ready?

871
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,333
- Yes.
- Okay.

872
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,266

- Yes, ma'am.

Wow.

I'm so impressed with you.

Oh!

935
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,500
So in the running, like there's
one more step, or...

936
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,934
- No, you're in, girl.

937
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,400
- [screams]
Oh, my god!

938

Start the race.

941
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,233
Shoot the gun.

942
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,300
- All right, darling.

943
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,266
- Buh-bye. Thank you.
- Bye. Awesome.

944
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:27,066
All right, Santino, I think we
got some really gorgeous gals.

945
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:28,633
- The world is going to gag.

946
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,266
- The world will be gagging.

947
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,633
Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

948
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:34,867
- Every drag queen knows
that there's one thing

949
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,300
that can never be too tight:

950
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,734
her lip-sync.

951
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:43,533
Because one day, her very life

952
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,767

970
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,333
My advice to those girls is to
keep working on your game,

971
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:41,266
because persistence pays off,
as proven by this next queen,

972

who applied not once, not twice,
but three times

Alexis Mateo.

976
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,433
- Hi, everybody.

977
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:59,834
My name is Alexis Mateo
from St. Pete, Florida.

978
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,533
I'm 30 years old.

979
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:03,333
I always bring something
to the table

980
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,367
completely different
and completely fresh.

981
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,600
And I'm original
from Puerto Rico,

982
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,934
and I come from a broken family.

983
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,433
I grew up
always trying to be accepted

984
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,266
and always trying to be
part of something.

985
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,066
When I was 12 years old,

986
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:24,333
I realized that all my dreams
were set in the performing life.

987
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,867
This is Alexis Mateo,

988
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:30,834
the little character
that I create inside my room

989
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,767
after that fabulous first
drag show that I saw.

990
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,266
It's the only thing
that I have of my own,

991
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:39,266
that nobody can steal from me.

992
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,133
When I'm with other drag queens,

993
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:44,400
I do have a very strong
point of view that I defend

994
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,967
and that I make myself be heard
and be respected.

995
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,400
Let me see.
What else can I show you?

996
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,700
This, I started
with a long dress,

997
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,567
and I just kind of cut it.

998
00:39:56,567 --> 00:40:03,600
I use Mardi Gras beads sewn.

999
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,700
It's completely turned
into a giant ball gown.

1000
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,900

I love Alexis Mateo

1008

bundle of inspiration

from everybody.

1018

My style,
especially professionally,

1019
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:02,166
is pretty much
just to go in there,

1020
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,367
do what you have to do

1021
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,767
without a whole bunch
of unnecessary extra.

1022
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,700
Well, I don't perform
professionally.

1023
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,400
That's not, like,
my form of income.

1024
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,700
I don't do it for a living.

1025
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,333
I actually compete
in the ballroom circuit.

1026
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,133
And so it's pretty much kind of
a sudden-death version

1027
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,433
of a pageant.

1028
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:22,567
You have about 30 to 45 seconds
to prove yourself.

1029
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,066
I'm bringing my "A" game,

1030
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,700
so y'all girls better have your
lashes, your wigs,

1031
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,133
and your fish grease,

1032
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:30,700
because this one's
gonna be good.

1033
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,567
Okay, so I'm officially out of
the closet,

1034
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:35,834
ponytails and all.

1035
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:38,967
This is the magic room.

1036
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,600
This is, like,
all my human hair wigs.

1037
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,333
This is where I keep them,
'cause they're so delicate.

1038
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,900
They're so easy to tangle.

1039
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,567
If you don't condition
and shampoo them

1040
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:52,066
like you would your real hair,
oh, guess what.

1041
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:53,767
This is where I keep
all my drag,

1042
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:57,433
my feathers and hair
and shoes and things.

1043
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,200
Actually made these myself.

1044
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,233
I can't wait to serve y'all
little girls.

1045
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:05,400
- ♪<i> Hey, deejay, love the way ♪</i>

1046
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,667
♪<i> I lose my inhibitions</i>
<i>when you spin ♪</i>

1047
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:13,066
♪<i> And I don't care</i>
<i>if people stare ♪</i>

1048
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:16,300
♪<i> I'd rather boogie</i>
<i>than try to fit in ♪</i>

1049
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,233
- Life is a drag,
and it's fabulous.

1050
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:21,834
I mean, I'm really actually
couldn't see myself

1051
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,233
doing anything else.

1052
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:26,100
It's been an ongoing process
of meeting new people,

1053
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,367
learning new things.

1054
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:30,667
To me, my whole life--
it's an adventure.

1055
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:31,700
Just enjoy it.

1056
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,734
Don't take anything serious.

1057
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,533
Except for your hair.

1058
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:42,667
- Mariah is bringing ballroom
heat and serving realness.

1059
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,900

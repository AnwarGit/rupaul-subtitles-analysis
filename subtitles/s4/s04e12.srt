00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,834
<i>Season 4.</i>

173
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,800
<i>- So how does that</i>
<i>make you feel?</i>

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,066
<i>- Yay. Ooh,</i>
<i>my teeth look good too.</i>

175
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,834
- Once they arrived,

176
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,834
these girls wasted no time

177
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,767
doing what drag queens do best--

178
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,233
ki ki!

179
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,700
Now, I proudly present the world
premiere of...

180
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,967
<i>Shit My Girls Say.</i>

181
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,800
- The library is now open.

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,333
- No sale, no search, no shade.

183
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,967
- No shade.
- No shade.

184
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,100
- No shade, no tea.

185
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,600
- Work.
- No tea.

186
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,066
- No tea, no shade.
- No tea, no shade.

187
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,567
- Girl...
- No, but no shade, no tea.

188
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,867
- Ooh!
- Oww!

189
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,800
- The category is cheesecake.
- Cheesecake.

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,834
- Eat it!

191
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,200
- I will never be late
for dinner.

192
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,734
- Eat it!
- Bella!

193
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,166
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?

194
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,433
- Bitch, you are a fish!
- Gorgeous fish.

195
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,066
- Eat it. Eat it!

196
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,500
- I'm probably gonna get read
for Phil...for Phil...for Phil.

197
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
- Beat that wig!
- Beating the face, girl.

198
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
- Yeah, but not literally
beating my face.

199
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,066
- I am trying!
- A post-apocolake--apocolake.

200
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,967
A post-apocolake.
Apocolake.

201
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,066
That's all I--
that's how I say it.

202
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,767
- I love being a woman.

203
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,233
- I love pussy.

204
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,433
- Yes, who doesn't?

205
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,100
- They all assume that
I want to be a woman,

206
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,333
like, and I don't.
- You gotta find the inner diva.

207
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,200
- Lookin' fabulous!
- Work it, girl.

208
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,834
- Put some foam around that ass.

209
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,800
- When making your ass, always
draw the shape of Africa.

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,533
- This is gonna look a hot mess.
- Should I tuck?

211
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,767
- All you have to do is dip it
in some apple cider vinegar

212
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:58,967
and it tightens right back up.

213
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,200
[kiss]

214
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,734
- Daylight is no friend
of the dragoon.

215
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,133
- Dry those tears and powder
those cheekbones, okay?

216
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,367
- This is called
cutting a cheek.

217
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,266
- You know how much garbage
comes out of these

218
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,233
over-painted lips.

219
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,367
- Yes, ma'am!
- Girl, no.

220
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,867
- My moustache
is gonna start showing.

221
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,567
- People don't even know how
much of a man

222
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,333
it takes to be a drag queen.

223
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,834
- Where the fuck are my tits?

224
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,400
- If you have a cameltoe,
that's perfect.

225
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,700
- This season, with all
the backstage conflama--

226
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,467
that's "conflict" and "drama"--

227
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,300
we couldn't fit it all
into the series.

228
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,200
So let's start
with some sassy outtakes

229
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,567
from the You Better Work room.

230
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,567
- If we had to imitate
somebody in here,

231
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,433
- Okay, but Willam--
- I would do Willam.

232
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:41,066
- Willam, 'cause, you know--

233
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,400
[laughter]

234
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,567
- Hold on, hold on.

235
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,066
I'm actressing.

236
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,867
You can catch me
on<i> Sex and the City</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and--</i>

237
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,300
[laughter]

238
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,066
Extras for--
- Oh, my God!

239
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,066
- Any extra that they ever
needed a gay prostitute.

240
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,567
- Willam.

241
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,100
- And the category is?

242
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,500
- Oh, my God!
[laughs]

243
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,400
- People must just look at you
and be like,

244
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,266
"Oh, my God, Jujubee!"

245
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,600
- That's the Lane Bryant
Jujubee.

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,567
- She went to a buffet before
she entered the race.

247
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,600
- Wow.
- Really, bitch?

248
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,500
- She is a bitch.
I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.

249
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,567
What does "bitch" mean?

250
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,367
both: Being In Total
Control Of Herself.

251
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:19,700
- Bitch!

252
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,633
[laughter]

253
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,600
- Does anyone know any good
drag toasts for drinks?

254
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,533
- Here's to women,
women divine,

255
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,633
they bloom every month,
they bear every nine,

256
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,867
the only of God's creatures
this side of hell

257
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,633
that they could get juice from
a nut without cracking a shell.

258
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,633
- Oh!
- I got one too.

259
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,700
Here's to the girl
in the little brown shoes.

260
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,233
She'll eat your man
and drink your booze.

261
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,133
She'll eat your cherry
and drink your gin,

262
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,166
but thank God I got my deep
brown box my cherry came in.

263
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,066
- Cheers!

264
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:50,467
- Michelle,
you look fantastic.

265
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:53,166
- Thank--Sharon, thank you,
thank you.

266
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,066
- Say, you know,
the thing about me and RuPaul--

267
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,066
when we go down to a gay bar,

268
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,100
we both get mistaken
for drag queens.

269
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,867
[laughter]

270
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,033
I don't know!
It's crazy.

271
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,667
It's crazy.
It's just me.

272
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,066
- You know what,
Cher, I like you,

273
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,500
and I'm gonna tell you why.
- Tell me.

274
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,166
- You don't give a fuck.
- I don't give a rat's ass.

275
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,600
- And that's what I like
about you.

276
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,934
- I don't give a rat's ass.

277
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,533
You know, I'm every
gay man's best friend.

278
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,700
And that's a lot of holes
to fill.

279
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,133
- [laughs]

280
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,834
Now, I created
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

281
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,000
to elevate the art of drag.

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,233
But I know you all love it

283
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,600
when these bitches get shady.

284
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Roll the tape.

285
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,667
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?

286
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,100
Y'all look like a sweatshop.

287
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,433
- Jiggly too--she talkin'

288
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,667
about she saw this thing.

289
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,200
- Who?
- Her.

290
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
- This bitch is shady.

291
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,934
- That smelly bitch,
she got nerve.

292
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,867
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you, you monster.

293
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,133
- Me? I'm monster?
- Yeah, you.

294
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,333
- Who's the big one in here?

295
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,033
- Girl, you look like a horse.

296
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,300
- Roar.
- You look like a horse.

297
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,166
- You wanna call me a horse,
honey, that's fine.

298
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,233
Horses have gorgeous legs,
and these legs will kick.

299
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,200
- You look like you've been
kicking, all right--

300
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,266
kicking flour.

301
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,867
Put some lotion on them
ashy-ass knees.

302
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,967
- Bitch, bye, boo!

303
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,533
- You ugly,
and I'm at peace with it.

304
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,867
[laughter]

305
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,233
- Willam's school for bitches
is now opening,

306
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,100
accepting enrollments
for the 2011--

307
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,066
- I already graduated.

308
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,767
- Nurse. Like, "Oh, nurse."

309
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,600
- Nurse.
- Yeah, 'cause she needs help.

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
And nurses help people.

311
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,133
Nurse.

312
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,400
- Did this bitch really
just come for me?

313
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,367
- Ooh, nurse!

314
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,200
- All that venom inside you,
mama.

315
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
We need to do an extraction.

316
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
- Out of me?
- Yeah.

317
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,200
- You think I'm evil?

318
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,367
- Didn't Sharon look pretty
yesterday?

319
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,333
- What?
- Sharon. I was shocked.

320
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,233
- [laughs]
- Don't think about it.

321
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,467
What makes you happy? Food?
Food makes you happy, right?

322
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,834
- I know you have low
self-esteem,

323
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,066
so I'll let you think you won.

324
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,767
- Thank you.

325
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,533
- Your attitude sucks.

326
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,433
It sucks, and you suck.

327
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:46,633
- I can't hear you.

328
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,300
- What did you read me about
now, you bitch?

329
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,834
- Girl, you're so insecure.

330
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,867
Nobody was even
talking about you.

331
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,100
Paint your face.

332
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,166
- You're such a rude bitch,
Phi Phi.

333
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,333
- Oh, well.

334
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,600
You might not have to deal
with it for long.

335
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,567
- [chuckling]

336
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,567
- Just like<i> Glee,</i>

337
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,333
there's something
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

338
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,400
that makes a queen just
break out in song.

339
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,066
<i>- ♪ Comin' down the runway</i>
<i>in a velvet gown ♪</i>

340
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,800
<i>♪ I pound down the runway,</i>
<i>400 pounds ♪</i>

341
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,433

- What's that mean,
"Jesus is a biscuit"?

372
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,066

373

374

376
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,767

and Anglo-Saxon and shit.

377
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,066
Y'all never heard of
sopping it up with a biscuit?

378

- No.
- No, seriously, what's sop up?

379
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,700
- Sopping it up means you, like,

380
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,800
take your syrup
and your biscuit or whatever,

381
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,133
and you sop it up.

382
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,166
- Yeah, I do eat that.
- You know about sopping it up--

383
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,533
- Oh, you take
the biscuit after--

384
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,934
when it's on your plate,
and you go...

385
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,967
- That's soppin' it up!
- That's soppin' it--

386
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,900
yes, I know how to sop it up,
girl!

387
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,934
- Now, a lot of what happens
during filming

388
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:51,734
is just too hot to air, so label
these next clips N.S.F.W.--

Not safe for the workroom.

390
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,867
- There's a bunch of booties
back here.

391
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:04,200
- Mama, somebody left, like,
a dirty Kotex in my station.

392
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,767
- Aah! I think Phi Phi
might be in heat.

393
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,667
- Guys, my butt hurts.

394

- [laughing] I can't.

397
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,133

it's gonna come out of.

398
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,333
- [burps]

399
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,967
- Rick Santorum is,
if you google his name,

400
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:21,567
there is a filthy, filthy
definition that comes up,

401
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,633
because a gay man
was smart enough to make it

402
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,500
an urban dictionary word
or something.

403
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,834
And he hates gay people.

404
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,867
So I'm glad that
it's called that.

405
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,367
- Oh...my God.

406
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,066
I did not know all this.

407
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,600
- The queens just love to sit
around the table

408
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,467

409
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:41,867
It's like<i> The View,</i>
only more ladylike.

410
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,633
Hey, Miss Hasselbeck,

411
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,100
no tea, no shade.

412
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,467
Word up, girl.

413
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,367
- What president do you think

414
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:50,800
or have you found to be

415
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,467
the best or good-looking?

416
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,500
You know, like, the hottest
president we've had?

417
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,700
- Oh, my Mr. Obama.

418
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,066
- You think he's hot?

419
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,166
- Absolutely, he's so handsome.
- You do him? Yeah?

420
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,667
- Absolutely, and then I think--
- Bill Clinton.

421
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,567
- Bill Clinton.
- That's who I got my vote.

422
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,900
- Eww.

423
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,066
- When he first started,
he was hot.

424
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,533
- But President Obama, he's--

425
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,100
I've always thought he was just
so handsome and so charismatic.

426
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,633
- Lincoln was kind of cute.

427
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,934
He was really, really--
he was really tall and--

428
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:18,667
- In like a woodsman
kind of way.

429
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,867
- Yeah, and he wore, like,
a steampunk's top hat.

430
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,133
He looked really punk.

431
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,800
- Didn't George Washington
wear wigs?

432
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,900
- He did.

433
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,400
- So he could
double our collection.

434
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,967
- And Taft, if you're
a chubby chaser.

435
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,133
He was all right.

436
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,700
He's the one that got stuck
in the tub.

437
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,066
- Huh.
- Wow.

438
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,500
- Doing what?

439
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,633
- The one thing I didn't get is,
what is with the wig wars

440
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,433
when drag queens snatch off
their wigs during a lip-sync?

441
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:39,567
- Well, I mean--

442
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,166
- Like, you took off
a sequined dress,

443
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,400
and your wig stayed on.

444
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,367
And then, all of a sudden,
she just pulls her off.

445
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,367
- Well, you know, I felt like
you're in the moment,

446
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,400
and that song has so much
angst going on in it,

447
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,433
and I literally couldn't, like,
the hair was in my face.

448
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,667
- Well, that's one thing.

449
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,433
- So I was like,
"I gotta get rid of this hair,

450
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,433
so they can see my lips."

451
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,066
- But why did she
pull off her wig?

452
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,100
- It just--y'all,
they got down, girl.

453
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,400
They got down.

454
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,467
- It's lip sync for your life.
You know?

455
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,633
- If the wig falls off,
it falls off,

456
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,400
but I am not personally
taking that bitch off.

457
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,066
- It's all staying on, bitch,
when I do it.

458
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,900
- All those pins in there--
bitch, I had, like,

459
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,066
40 pins in my head.

460
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,967
- That's a desperate cry
for attention.

461
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,633
- A little<i> I Am What I am,</i>
<i>La Cage.</i>

462
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,834
- You know? Yeah.
But it's, like, unnecessary.

463
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,633
I understand you're born
this way, but...

464
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,066
- Right.

465
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,266
- Yeah, right now, you gotta be
a woman and stay a woman.

466
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,467
And you're killing my illusion.

467
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,967
- Where do you stand on these

468
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,800
very important issues?

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,066
Tweet your thoughts
to #DragRace,

470
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,567

471
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:35,834
Welcome back to the Glamazon

472
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,100
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

473
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,433
It's time to flashback to the
queens' most memorable moments.

474
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,066
All right, boys.

475
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,066
Let me see what you got.

476
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,133
Now the first queen to leave us

477
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,867
was Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

478
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,967
- Hallelu!
I'm back, bitches.

479
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,867
[group groans]

480
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,734
Hallelu is in the building.

481
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:03,967
- After trying to crash
the party one more time,

482
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,800
I had her removed
from the competition...

483
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,133
[cheering]

484
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,433
And sent some place where
they'd really appreciate

485
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,900
her style and humor.

486
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,934
- [screaming]

487
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,967
- Let's just say
the zombies ate her up.

488
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,967
- Aah, hallelu!

489
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:24,066
Hallelu!

490
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,266
- Hello, how y'all doing?

491
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,200
- Alisa Summers experienced

492
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,400
quite a lot
in her short time here.

493
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,867
She braved exposure
to toxic waste.

494
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,533
- Do we get a barf bag?
- Aah!

495
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,934
- And a zombie attack.

496
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,900
But her post-apocalyptic runway
couture

497
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,734
didn't devastate our judges...

498
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,400
and Alisa Summers
did not survive.

499
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,834
Now, Lashauwn Beyond
was something unique

500
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,100
to this competition...

501
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,767
a shy drag queen.

502
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,734
- Hi, queen one.

503
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:56,767
- Hi.

504
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,233
- Now, her apocalyp--

505
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,600
her--her [indistinct]

506
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,567
- "Post-apocolake."

507
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,967
- Her couture was
out of this world.

508
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,100
But Lashauwn lacked nerve.

509
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,867
And it do take nerve.

510
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,934
What can't you believe?

511
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:11,400
- That I'm here.

512
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,567
- Bitch, you're here.

513
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,200
- Yeah, honey,
you better snap out of it.

514
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,633
But in week two, Lashauwn
was sent to the great beyond.

515
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,633
all: Whoa.

516
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:23,767
- Hi.

517
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,066
- The Princess,
a reserved extrovert,

518
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,467
struggled to let
her sparkle shine.

519
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,066
- [singing]

520
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,734
Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?

521
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,066
- After lackluster performances,

522
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,467
the judges felt The Princess
didn't have enough

523
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,800
zing in her Zen.

524
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,433
But she'll live forever
as Drag Race royalty.

525
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,734
- Hi, y'all.

526
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,934
- [screaming]

527
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,767
- What's the Spanish word
for roller coaster?

528
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,767
I bet Madame Laqueer knows,

529
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:54,633
because that was her ride
on Drag Race.

530
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,800
She won the wrestling
competition...

531
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,467
- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.

532
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:00,767
- [chuckles]

533
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,967
- But was always the last person
picked for teams.

534
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,934
- I wouldn't want to choose
Madame for my team

535
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,200
because I don't want her.

536
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
- She was team captain
for the sitcom challenge.

537
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,500
- [screams]

538
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,200
- But after a Razzie-worthy
performance,

539
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,133
Madame Laqueer
had to sashay away.

540
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,467
- Hey,
there's a new girl in town.

541
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,533
Let's get to business.

542
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,066
- Next stop, Paris, London,
Milan.

543
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,500
- Mahogany.

544
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,734
- This queen brought Broadway
experience to the competition.

545
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,633
- That young man look pretty
mature enough

546
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,633
to handle a beaver on his own.

547
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,934
- Um, Milan.

548
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,934
You're kind of
playing this stuff out here.

549
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:38,200
Look at the person
that you're talking to.

550
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,467
- Sorry.

551
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,066
- Her fierce lip sync helped her
stay in the game.

552
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,200
But the third time
was not a charm.

553
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,600
And Milan was sent back
to Broadway.

554
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,567
- Hi.
- What's good, ladies?

555
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,100
- Next up,
Miss Jiggly Caliente.

556
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:58,066
- [singing]

557
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:01,367
- And yes,
you may call her Jiggly.

558
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,467
She started strong, by winning
the toxic photo shoot.

559
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,567
- Yeah!

560
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,900
[cheering]

561
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,734
- But her hoarding couture
put her up for elimination.

562
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,066
- I'm getting
my eyeballs assaulted.

563
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,800
- Her tough New York
attitude...

564
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,100
do you take the train and drive?

565
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
- Yes, mama,
I have to get to work.

566
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,033
- Jiggly will cut a bitch.
- Thank you.

567
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,000
- Soon gave way to self-doubt.

568
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,867
- What the hell
would I write about

569
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,133
how to eat a pound of chicken?

570
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,867
- Exactly, that's funny.

571
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,066
- Oh.

572
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,066
Damn.

573
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:32,367
- She fought hard
in the lip syncs.

574
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,633
But the third and final face off

575
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,633
was the last for this
plus-sized Barbie.

576
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,800
- Deuces.

577
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,867
[laughter]

578
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,700
- Willam's rare combination
of sexy and funny

579
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,600
made her the queen to beat.

580
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,867
- Ooh, a 26, damn.

581
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,633
We got some big girls.

582
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,300
I hope they don't have diabetes.

583
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,900
- Already a successful
working actor...

584
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,266
- You look really familiar, Ma.
- Me?

585
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,367
You must have a television.

586
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,934
- She never let us forget it.

587
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,834
- I was on<i> Boston Public</i>
with you.

588
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,934
I was the best friend
of Candace Kane when she died.

589
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:07,133
I died on<i> Nip/Tuck.</i>

590
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,867
<i>CSI: New York,</i>
<i>Women's Murder Club.</i>

591
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,500
- Is that Willam
dropping names over there?

592
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
- Her acting experience served

593
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
her well in the challenges...

594
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,934
- Willam, you're funny.

595
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,467
- Thank you, hire me.

596
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,066
[laughter]

597
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,600
And so did her sickening body.

598
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,500
- I hope that lotion's
waterproof.

599
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,600
- But when I discovered
that off-screen,

600
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,767
Willam had violated show rules,

601
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,367
I had no choice but to give

602
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:33,266
this sexy drag queen
the heave-ho.

603
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,967
Willam, it has come to my
attention

604
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:40,066
that you have broken the rules.

605
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,667
Willam, I have to ask you

606
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,934
to leave the competition
immediately.

607
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:49,066
Now, sashay away.

608
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,400
- Category is...

609
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,700
all: Cheesecake!

610
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,967
- Our next queen was a tasty
slice of cheesecake.

611
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,100
Dida Ritz.

612
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,200
[cheering]

613
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,066
-<i> Bonjour,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ladies.</i>

614
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,367
- Feisty and lovable...

615
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,800
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

616
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,300
- It's nice to see you again.

617
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,200
- Dida won fans on the runway.

618
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,900
- Supermodel.

619
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,266
- The judges lived for her long
legs and catwalk stomping,

620
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:22,100
but felt her fashion sense
was a bit pedestrian.

621
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,300
- Outfit-wise, I wasn't moved
one way or the other.

622
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,367
- My name is Dida Ritz,
I'm here representing--

623
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,834
or running for Wig Party.

624
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:32,133
- Her presidential debate did
not win her any supporters...

625
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,300
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.

626
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,400
- And she was voted
off the show.

627
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,066
But had there been
a wig-whipping challenge,

628
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,900
Dida may just have gone
all the way.

629
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,700
- Hi, girls.

630
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,066
[cheering]

631
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,233
- Little Kenya Michaels
was a tiny queen

632
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,633
who posed a big threat
to the other girls.

633
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,233
- [laughs]
- She's cute.

634
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,500
- Fuck.

635
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,266
- Kenya was a spicy firebird
on the runway...

636
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,700
- Bella!

637
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,333
- And in the wrestling ring.

638
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,500
- Praise God!

639
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
[indistinct yelling]

640
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,934
- What did you just do?

641
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:09,433
- In the snatch game,
we weren't<i> Crazy In Love</i>

642
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,367
with her Beyonce impression.

643
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,300
Oh!

644
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,100
And Kenya was sent packing.

645
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,900
[kisses]

646
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,066
- Ay!

647
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,600
[cheering]

648
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,967
- But the judges felt Kenya
had more to offer,

649
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,433
and invited her back.

650
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:30,367
But when her makeover of a dad
turned into a dud...

651
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,533
- Being pregnant's hard.

652
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,433
- Macabre too, apparently.
- Yeah.

653
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:37,233
- It was<i> hasta la vista</i>
for this sexy senorita.

654
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,767
[kisses]

655
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,800
[cheering]

656
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,500
- Ow!

657
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,200
Eat it!

658
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,333
- Sit back, relax, and pour
yourself an ice cold glass

659
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,233
of miss Latrice Royale.

660
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:52,734
- The shade,
the shade of it all.

661
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:56,567
- Her curves and swerves had the
judges captivated,

662
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,100
and so did her body slams.

663
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,367
- Aah!

664
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,633
- Mmm.
Well, hello, gorgeous.

665
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:06,600
- As Large Marge, she killed it
in the sitcom challenge.

666
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,500
- Get those nuts
away from my face.

667
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
- Her full-bodied grace
and soul made her a contender

668
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,100
to win it all.

669
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,767
But when her canine couture
went to the dogs,

670
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,133
Latrice was sent home.

671
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,667
- I am Latrice Royale.

672
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,133
- Bitches better beware.

673
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,400
<i>all: ♪ Latrice! ♪</i>

674
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,667
- Royale!

675
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,266
[applause]

676
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:33,767
- All my queens
are sickening, no?

677
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,900
But which one is your favorite?

678
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,433
Go to newnownext.com

679
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:40,166
and vote for Miss Congeniality.

680
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,633
Do it for your lips.

681
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,166
Welcome back to the Glamazon

682
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,967
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

683
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,166
The best seat in town
is the judges' table.

684
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,867
With my best squirrel friend,

685
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,700
Michelle Visage,
and my Judge Judys,

686
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,100
Santino Rice and Billy "V"
by my side--

687
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,333
well, things can get
a little bit stupid.

688
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,066
- If you do the research,
you won't have those

689
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,533
deer-in-headlights moments.

690
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:06,633
It's all the help.

691
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,533
- Did you just call her
the help?

692
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,400
- No, I said I'm here to help.

693
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,467
So I called myself the help.
- I see.

694
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,667
- It's okay because
I called myself the help,

695
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,567
and I am a black man...

696
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,633
dressed as a white woman.

697
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,166
- Yes.
- Sound familiar?

698
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,600
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]

699
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,767
- I did think of<i> Grey Gardens,</i>
that smell of cat piss.

700
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,066
- I thought that was me, so--

701
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,500
[laughter]

702
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,066
- When I look at you, it almost
looks like an<i> Austin Powers</i>

703
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,900
kind of joke or something.

704
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,533
If clothes looked like a couch,

705
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,300
or an ottoman, or a loveseat,

706
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
you just wanna stay away
from it, you know?

707
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,600
[barking]

708
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,367
- What did you just call me?

709
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,633
- And no matter where I am
in this studio,

710
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,066
I can hear her laughs.

711
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,300
And it's just the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

712
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,767
- [laughing]

713
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,300
- Every time she laughs,
her nuts get bigger.

714
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,900
- This season,
the judges' panel

715
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,834
was more star-studded than ever.

716
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:05,500
They were looking good
and feeling gorgeous.

717
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,934
- With the tattoos,
I felt like I was maybe about

718
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,166
to watch some sort of an adult,
erotic film of sorts...

719
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,066
- Oh, dear.

720
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,934
- Which, not opposed to at all.

721
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:15,934
- Hello.

722
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,133
Well, welcome to the jungle.

723
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:27,166
-<i> America's got talent</i>
has nothing on this show.

724
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:30,667
- She looks like Divine Brown,

725
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,633
but we're trying to excite
America, not Hugh Grant.

726
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,667
- She was going for
<i>Sex and the City,</i>

727
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,333
and it was more like
"Sex in the Alley."

728
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,500
- Well, I'm not gonna
turn that down either.

729
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:47,200
- I really want a drag name.

730
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,066
- Jennifer Love Hewitt
is the best drag name

731
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,066
I have ever heard.

732
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,800
I'm changing my name
to RuPaul Love Hewitt.

733
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,166
- [laughs]

734
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,567
[thunder]

735
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:02,700
- The judges provided the queens
with constructive criticism,

736
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,433
but I swear, some of them was
jealous of they boogie.

737
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,266
- I appreciate those
hair and pants.

738
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:09,633
- You can have them
when I'm done.

739
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,500
- Okay, girl. They're mine.
- They're yours.

740
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,600
- 'Cause I love them.

741
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,066
- May I borrow
that hairpiece you had?

742
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,200
- The red one?
- Yes.

743
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,667
- I would like to borrow
your dress.

744
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,734
- You can have it.

745
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:18,867
- From your neck up,

746
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,734
I would decapitate you
and wear your head.

747
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,200
And I'm living for that ring.

748
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,734
- This is actually a broach.
I just threw a ring on it.

749
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,300
- Bitch.

750
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,900
- And PS, fuck you for having
the most amazing body ever.

751
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
- Your body is possibly
the sickest I've ever seen

752
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,467
on a queen in any season.

753
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,066
It's the legs, then she
turns around, it's the ass,

754
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,900
and that face--
my God.

755
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,934
- Your legs are really
something major,

756
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:45,066
and that is amazing.

757
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,433
- How dare they have better
legs than me?

758
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,834
How very dare they?

759
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,667
- Now, the celebrities weren't
just here to look fierce.

760
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,900
Once I scanned
their library cards,

761
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,734
those bitches
were ready to read.

762
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:01,333
- If we were gonna
go out on the town,

763
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,834
I'd pull you aside and say,

764
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,300
"Let's go look in your closet
closet and find something else."

765
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,734
- The wig looked like a litter
of kittens had sucked on it,

766
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,300
and she found it in the garbage.

767
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,934
- I would love to have
a cocktail with you.

768
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,767
Whether or not I would
get up to use the bathroom

769
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,233
and never come back,
I don't know.

770
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:15,367
[laughter]

771
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:16,934
- Is that a pot scrubber
on your head,

772
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,066
or are you just happy to see me?

773
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,800
- I was wondering,
after I painted my room,

774
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,133
where the drop cloth went.

775
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,133
- Yeah, there it is, right.
- That's where it was.

776
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,433
- Last night, my leftovers were
in the shape of aluminum foil

777
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,767
with a swan, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

778
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,266
- And somebody
put your leftovers

779
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,600
in the shape of Jiggly.

780
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,834
- [laughs]

781
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,834
- You know, that was a little
Jonbenet Ramsey.

782
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,066
That was a little creepy for me.

783
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,533
- You know, before,
I had a problem

784
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,934
with the makeup
every single time.

785
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,867
Today was the best
that it's been.

786
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,900
- Now, is that a read?

787
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,066
- A little bit.
- Uh-huh.

788
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,633
The celebrities also revealed

789
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:47,300
plenty of personal information

790
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,667
that we tastefully chose not

791
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,066
to include in the show...

792
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,800
until now.

793
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,767
I need more energy on the panel.

794
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,667
So I need about five hamsters.

795
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,767
Are there any in the building?

796
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,133
- Including her tits.

797
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,467
- [laughs]

798
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,533
- All right, Wy.

799
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,967
Winner of the challenge?

800
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,066
- This is very hard for me.

801
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,734
I feel like they should all
win something.

802
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,900
I'd rather go to the
gynecologist than do this.

803
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
- I'm gonna go
to the gynecologist

804
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,934
with you after this.

805
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,900
- I like a pap smear.
Count me in.

806
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,900
- I love ex-cons, but that's
a whole nother show.

807
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,066
- I've gotten in trouble
with a couple of those.

808
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,867
- I think it cheapens
you a little bit,

809
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,600
like a hooker in the Bronx.

810
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,433
- They're expensive.
- Oh. Oh, are they?

811
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,700
John said they're expensive.

812
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
- I have seen larger queens
turn it out.

813
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,834
- Yes, miss perky.

814
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,333
- Are you talking about
my chest?

815
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,500
- You've been talking about it
all day, you're so cute.

816
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,166
Go forward.
- I want her fondle me.

817
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,767
- I'll fondle you.
- There you go.

818
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,600
- Phone call for RuPaul?
Okay, yeah, all right.

819
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,734
Obama's calling me
real quick, hold on.

820
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,934
Somebody said you'd bumped your
head earlier.

821
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,200
How is your head?

822
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,900
- Haven't had
any complaints yet.

823
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,233
[laughter]

824
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,934
Welcome back to the Glamazon

825
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:02,200
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

826
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
Now, this season the runway was

827
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
a fashion phenomenon.

828
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,800
And to help me rate
the ra sha sha,

829
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,233
I've invited back
queens from all seasons.

830
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:14,967
Welcome the sensational Chanel,

831
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,400
that funny fox Pandora Boxx,

832
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,900
and last, but not least,

833
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,834
we call this queen Mariah.

834
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,066
Hello, ladies.

835
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,467
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.

836
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:29,567
- Are you ready to countdown
the top ten most sickening

837
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:31,333
fits and fashions of the runway?

838
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,233
- Uh, my tuck is on fire.

839
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,300
- Literally.
- Yes.

840
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,700
- Let's go.

841
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,467
Coming in at number ten,

842
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:41,433
Milan serving disco harem chic.

843
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,233
Burn, baby, burn.

844
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,066
- T.G.I.F.

845
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:47,400
She came out like
that was her last dance.

846
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,066
- [laughs]

847
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,367
- When she was dancing around,

848
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,500
it definitely took some flight
with the air into it.

849
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,533
It was hot, love it.

850
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,066
- Yes, is it something
you would wear?

851
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:56,166
- No, but I liked it, yeah.

852
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,533
- No? [laughs]

853
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,233
At number nine,
it's Jiggly Caliente

854
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,500
working her '80s retro look.

855
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,767
- Grey Jell-O never looked
so good.

856
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,367
[laughter]

857
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,533
There was the Missy Elliot
video where they, like,

858
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,066
pumped her full of air.

859
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,867
- Right, right.
- Sickening, and that gave me,

860
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,400
very much, that sort of feel.

861
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,600
I live for Jiggly.

862
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,700
I think she's amazing.

863
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,367
In the number eight spot,

864
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:25,567
it's Latrice Royale
in royal blue.

865
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,266
Ooh, now I love that dress.

866
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,900
I love the color of that blue

867
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,367
with the color of her skin.

868
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,834
And was living for
an asymmetrical silhouette.

869
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:36,467
- True, true goddess.

870
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,300
Voluptuous, beautiful.

871
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,233
I love that her eye shadow
matched the gown.

872
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,266
She wore it impeccably.

873
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,767
- I just can't believe
how beautiful

874
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,667
Michael Clarke Duncan
looks...gorgeous.

875
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,767
- He's done really well
for himself.

876
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,300
- He really has.
- Yes, he has.

877
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,767
At number seven,
Phi Phi O'Hara,

878
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,233
survivor of the RuPocalypse.

879
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,567
Very [indistinct].

880
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,100
- It was like<i> Waterworld</i>
meets, like,

881
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,734
<i>Xena: Warrior Princess.</i>

882
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,800
And I loved that when she
walked,

883
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,467
it was very much, like,

884
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,066
"I know I'm the shit.

885
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:08,200
It's cool."

886
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,834
- Bushmeat
never looked so good.

887
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,233
- [laughs]

888
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,734
- I live for the attitude,
the confidence, the silhouette.

889
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,066
It had a purpose.

890
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,433
And she executed it very well.

891
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,567
- You didn't think it was
a little too roadkill?

892
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,100
- It gave me beaver
on the side of the road.

893
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,066
But, you know,
who doesn't love a good beaver?

894
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,100
- That's true.

895
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,600
- Especially
on the side of the road.

896
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,967
- You're absolutely right.

897
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,500
Number six, Dida Ritz...

898
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,300
serving gold and gams.

899
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,333
Very Fritz Lang<i> Metropolis.</i>

900
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,333
- The Walmart version.

901
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,934
I wouldn't personally wear it,

902
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:40,333
because I'm not that cheeky.

903
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,100
With her skin tone,
gold is absolutely amazing.

904
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,467
Her having legs for days,

905
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:49,800
she can really pull off
a look like that.

906
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,233
- Coming in at number five,

907
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:54,467
Chad Michaels'
renaissance realness.

908
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:55,667
Lady Chatterley.

909
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,266
- Gorgeous,
the dog days are gone.

910
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,266
- I think she was Joan Of Arc
in her former life.

911
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,166
- [laughs]

912
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,400
At number four,

913
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,066
little Kenya Michaels
is pretty in pink.

914
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,166
Oh, look at her.

915
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,967
- If Nicki had a my size Barbie,

916
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,533
that would be her.
- [laughs]

917
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,934
- Definitely.

918
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:17,066
- She's so adorable.
She's just, like, a little doll.

919
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:19,133
I wanna pick her up
and squeeze her till she pees.

920
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,667
- [laughs]

921
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,133
- I still have to question if
everything is down there still.

922
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,066
She is true, true Walmart fish.

923
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,233
She really is.

924
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,600
- [laughs]

925
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,433
At number three,
it's Sharon Needles,

926
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,467
serving drastic plastic chic.

927
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,066
- What drag queen does not love

928
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:37,233
a good battery acid
chemical peel?

929
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:39,900
- I love the "Madonna two weeks
before the Super Bowl" look.

930
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,233
- [laughs]

931
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:43,800
- Sharon has such
an incredible ability

932
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,567
to me to take something so odd
and make it so chic

933
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,600
and ugly-beautiful.

934
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
- The number two fits in fashion

935
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,667
is Willam's tummy troubles.

936
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,100
- [vomiting]

937
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,967
- I say, "Bitch, that's what you
get for eating solid food."

938
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,300
- Agreed.

939
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,934
- It's obvious somebody still
has their gag reflex.

940
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:11,100
She's giving blonde trash
everywhere a bad name.

941
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,433
- [laughs]

942
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:13,900
- Tara Reid
would be proud though.

943
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,066
- Tara Reid would be proud.

944
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,066
- You're absolutely right
about that.

945
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,100
- And now, if I may, Ru,

946
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,367
the number one most sickening
fits and fashion belongs to--

947
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,967
oh, you know, it's not just one.

948
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,066
It's 11 timeless looks.

949
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,800
- I think I know
where this is going.

950
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,166
- And the winner is...

951
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,600
RuPaul!

952
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,633
Roll tape.

953
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:38,066
[growling]

954
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,066
Oops, uh-oh,
I think I just got fired.

955
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,133
Roll the other tape.

956
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,633
- Chanel,
which one of my outfits

957
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:51,934
was your favorite?

958
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,900
- I have to say with the
feathers--the blue feathers.

959
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,600
Like, May West had
a RuPaul drag baby.

960
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,233
- I, of course,
love absolutely all of them.

961
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,066
- Yes, that goes with saying.

962
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,800
- It's a toss-up between
the best little Ruhouse

963
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,467
in Texas look.
- Yes, yes.

964
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,066
- Or the very flowing, like,

965
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,867
Barbie meets Mrs. Roper look.

966
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:13,834
- Yes, yes, I love that.
- Gorgeous.

967
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,667
- Gorgeous, gorgeous.

968
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,533
I'm not gonna
leave you out, Mariah.

969
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,133
- I have to pick
the emerald green.

970
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,934
I wanted to
ease on down the road,

971
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,500
and snatch it right out
of your closet.

972
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,066
- Oh, my goodness.

973
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,500
I'd give it you, but I just
don't want to see it on eBay.

974
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,333
[laughter]

975
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,567
All right,
just between us girls,

976
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,233
who do you think should be
crowned

977
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,600
America's next drag superstar?

978
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,734
Chanel?

979
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,800
- Chad Michaels.
He's so seasoned.

980
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,166
And he's so professional.

981
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,734
And he's a perfectionist
in every single thing he does.

982
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:45,834
- Pandora?

983
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,266
- I would really love to see

984
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,767
Sharon Needles take the title.

985
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,834
Because I think
she's so different

986
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:54,200
than any of the previous winners
that she would really

987
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,834
just take it to a whole,
different, crazy, spooky level.

988
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:57,967
And I love it.

989
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,133
- Mariah?

990
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,633
- My pick has to be
Phi Phi O'Hara.

991
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,200
She's definitely hungry.

992
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,433
She has the fire.

993
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:07,300
The attitude is channeled
the right way.

994
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,100
She can just sear
right through the competition.

995
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,834
- Well, ladies,
you'll have to wait

996
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,834
just like everyone else
to find out

997
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,567
who's crowned America's
next drag superstar.

998
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,567
Now, before you go,

999
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:24,133
there's a little thank you gift
under your seat.

1000
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,367
- [gasps]

1001
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,100
Look it.

1002
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,734
- It's<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Iron Fist shoes.

1003
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,166
- It's a petite size 12,
just like me.

1004
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,800
- I just want
to make love to it.

1005
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,066
- I love that.

1006
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,934
- Cute little kitten heel
to go play around in.

1007
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,233
- [meows]

1008
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,567
- Strap on some attitude, girls.

1009
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,400
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

1010
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,667
Next week,
it's attack of the Glamazons,

1011
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,834
as Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,

1012
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,100
and Sharon Needles
battle it out

1013
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,066
for the title of America's
next drag superstar,

1014
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:03,066
and walk away with a lifetime
supply of NYX cosmetics,

1015
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:07,266
and a one of a kind trip

1016
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,233
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>

1017
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:12,066
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut,

1018
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:15,934
and a cash prize of $100,000

1019
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:20,200
in the over-the-top extravaganza
that you won't want to miss.

1020
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,066
The time has come for us to take
an up and close personal look

1021
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,800
at the final three.

1022
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,967
- Well, hello, hello.
all: Hi.

1023
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,066
- How are y'all doing?

1024
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,734
- A Chicago showgirl,

1025
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:34,066
Phi Phi O'Hara is a feisty
firecracker...

1026
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,066
- Don't be jealous of my boogie.

1027
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,533
With the will to win...

1028
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:40,200
- I want to look like a hot
Miami piece of ass.

1029
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,667
- You look like it to me.
- Good.

1030
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,133
- Hungry and ambitious...

1031
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,734
- You're damn right I'm hungry.
You all should be hungry.

1032
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,133
- She always brings
her A game.

1033
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:52,433
- If the final say-so happened
today, you would win.

1034
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,867
- Oh, hell no!

1035
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,633
- Phi phi fierce
ruled the wrestling ring.

1036
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,066
[cheering]

1037
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,867
- Now, I'm gonna show you how
to really beat a mug, bitch.

1038
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,967
- And her fighting spirit
caused a few rumbles

1039
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,266
in the workroom as well.

1040
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,066
- At least I am
a showgirl, bitch.

1041
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,900
Go back to Party City,
where you belong.

1042
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,967
But Phi Phi also revealed
a softer side.

1043
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,834
- I wish I had a dad
like him to accept me

1044
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,100
for everything that I am.

1045
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,066
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?

1046
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,066
- Probably not.
And that's okay.

1047
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,667
I'm fine with that.
I hope he values...

1048
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,233
like, who I am.

1049
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,633
I'm a good person.

1050
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,633
- I really want you
to have my phone call.

1051
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,300
I really wanted to win it
for you.

1052
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,600
- Honey, thank you so much.

1053
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
- Yeah.

1054
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,467
- Phi Phi O'Hara has a magic
combination of talent,

1055
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:40,900
beauty, and ambition.

1056
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,600
But, is it enough

1057
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,667
to take her to the very top?

1058
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,700
- Morning, bitches.
- What's up?

1059
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,900
- Hi, everybody.

1060
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,367
- Let's turn back time
on Miss Chad Michaels.

1061
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,967
A world-class Cher impersonator.

1062
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,333
- Cher comes to her for tips.

1063
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,433
- This is one of many natural
hair colors

1064
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,734
that I'll be wearing tonight.

1065
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:02,900
[laughter]

1066
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm Cher, bitch.

1067
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,467
- Throughout the competition...
- You want some of this?

1068
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,333
We got plenty for you too.

1069
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,367
- This dark lady has proven...

1070
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,066
- Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.

1071
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:15,934
- That she's much more
than a gypsy.

1072
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,266
- I am from California.

1073
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,767
More specifically, the Shady
Acres Trailer Park on Doheny

1074
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,567
between Weho and Beverly Hills.

1075
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,934
- Tramp...
- What a jerk.

1076
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,200
- And a thief.

1077
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,133
- What made you think that
we could get away with

1078
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,367
sneaking into a nut farm
in the middle of the night?

1079
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,333
- Having accomplished
so much in her career,

1080
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,533
will the next feather
in this half-breed's headdress

1081
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,700
be the title of America's
next drag superstar?

1082
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:45,200
[cheering]

1083
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,600
- Sharon Needles arrived
as the freaky underdog.

1084
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,133
- I look spooky,
but I'm really not.

1085
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,266
- And her spooky-drag persona

1086
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,867
set her apart from the start.

1087
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:56,734
- Oh, she's bleeding.
- Goodness.

1088
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,133
- Somebody call a dentist.

1089
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,533
- She didn't hit off
with the other girls initially.

1090
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,233
- I think a lot of the girls
here think I'm a one-trick pony.

1091
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:06,033
You know, I'm just a spook,
monster girl.

1092
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:08,333
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.

1093
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,767
That's all we need you to do.

1094
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:16,900
- But Sharon soon won over the
judges with her edgy aesthetic.

1095
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,800
- I didn't even get the name
right away.

1096
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,533
- All in the past, Miss Cole.

1097
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,433
- Okay?

1098
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,567
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.

1099
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,734
- All right, well, yes.

1100
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,433
- But she was plagued
by nagging guilt

1101
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,066
over her boyfriend back home.

1102
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,000
- She's auditioned
all four years,

1103
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,900
and then I try out one time
and, you know, here I am.

1104
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,433
I feel guilty about it
all the time.

1105
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:40,400
- But Sharon rose above
and kept on winning.

1106
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,433
- Condragulations.

1107
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:42,367
Condragulations.

1108
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,767
Condragulations.
- Yes.

1109
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,400
- You are the winner
of this challenge.

1110
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,333
[applause]

1111
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,300
She showed the judges
that she could diversify

1112
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300
her dark-sided drag.

1113
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,033
But always stayed true
to her own unique style.

1114
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:58,667
- You look like you
came out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>

1115
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,400
- Ooh.
- From spooky to unspookable,

1116
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,734
does Sharon Needles
have the fright stuff

1117
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,867
to be America's
next drag superstar?

1118
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,567
The top three girls,
the best of the best.

1119
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,867
So which of these amazing queens
has the charisma,

1120
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:19,133
uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

1121
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:22,500
to be America's
next drag superstar?

1122
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Let's consult the stars.

1123
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,867
Tell us what the future holds,

1124
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:31,066
Madame Visage.

1125
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:32,100
- Chad Michaels.

1126
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,233
Chad Michaels is a Pisces,

1127
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:35,567
and fish always do well
in this competition.

1128
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,266
I predict Chad Michaels will be

1129
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:40,633
America's next drag superstar.

1130
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,066
- Oh, spoil alert.

1131
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,834
Well, what's the story
for the others?

1132
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,433
- Sharon Needles is a Leo

1133
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:48,767
with Scorpio rising
and panties dropping.

1134
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:49,867
I see it now.

1135
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:53,367
Sharon Needles
will win this competition.

1136
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:55,233
- Wait a minute,
I thought you said

1137
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,367
Chad Michaels was gonna win.
- What, you--what?

1138
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:59,367
You don't question
Madame Visage, girl.

1139
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,433
Hold the celestial phone.

1140
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:04,166
Phi Phi O'Hara
is a double-jointed Virgo.

1141
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,700
As see it as clear
as a Lucite hooker-heel.

1142
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,834
Phi Phi O'Hara is the winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

1143
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:14,400
- Don't quit your day job,
Madame Visage.

1144
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,834
What you say about my boob job?

1145
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,233
- Well, what is crystal clear

1146
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:22,567
is this competition
has never been so close.

1147
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:26,066
And, with a cash prize
of $100,000,

1148
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:28,233
next week's final challenge

1149
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:30,667
promises to be the most
pressure-filled

1150
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,400
and surprising
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>

1151
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,266
You won't want to miss a moment.

1152
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,667
Until next week...

1153
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,066
if you can't love yourself,

1154
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:42,133
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

1155
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,867
Can I get an amen up in here?

1156
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:45,066
- Amen.

1157
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,166
- All right.
Let the music play.

- I like a cheesy salad.

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:14,533
- Vivienne, if you can bring
your energy up to meet Roxxxy...

6
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,233
- You're gettin' lost.

7
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:19,100
- It was pure hell.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,033
Fuck you, Alyssa.

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,033
- Coco is always the victim.

10
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,834
- You committed
the number-one crime.

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,734
You bored me.

Monica, sashay away.

16

- Monica Beverly Hillz.

17
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,800
- We're back in the workroom,

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,934
and Monica got sent home.

19
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:00,867
- I would have been incredibly
sad if Coco would have left.

20
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,800
I mean, she is my most closest
friend here.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,967
I'm not going to be a yin yang
without my yin.

22
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,066
- So what was it like, girl?

23
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,700
- It taught me a big lesson
that, you know,

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,734
in this competition,
you have to focus

25
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,066
and concentrate
on what you're doing.

26
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:13,967
- Right.

27
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,834
- I haven't been focused.

28
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,066
In the whole competition,

29
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,133
Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.

30
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:23,333
I've got to shake this off
and move on.

31
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,367
- Vivienne, were you scared?

32
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,367
'Cause when you turned around,

33
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,266
Vivienne's face was like--

34
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,367
- I wanted to fucking throw up.

35
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,533
Are you kidding me?

36
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,066
I thought I was going to pull
a Willam.

37
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,467
I was so fucking scared.

38
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,767
You don't even know.

39
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,400
- Vivienne's critique
was basically

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,533
that she played little,

41
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,333
and I overshadowed her
in our scene.

42
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,834
She knows that she didn't shine
last week,

43
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,233
so she's got to shine
this week and pull through.

44
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:46,066
- At first, we were working
really well together,

45
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,266
and our script
was really good,

46
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:51,066
but once you get there...

47
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,600
At this point, I'm pissed.

48
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,467
I really felt like Roxxxy
overpowered me.

49
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,367
I think that she's
an attention whore.

50
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,567
- Oh, oh, my--ah!

51
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,834
Oh, my god.

52
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,967
- I personally think
that she's annoying.

53
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,266
I'm going to be honest.

54
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,066

00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,500
Why it gotta be black?

187
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,066
[laughter]

188
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,633
- Hallelujah, thank the Ru gods

189
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,500
for sending a challenge my way

190
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,867
that I could excel in.

191
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:58,834
This is what I do.

192
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,300
I'm a dancer.

193
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,900
- Now, Jinkx and Coco,
you won the mini challenge,

194
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,667
so you're team captains.

195
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,834
All right, Coco, you pick first.

196
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:11,133
- Alyssa Edwards.

197
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,967
[record scratches]

198
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,667
- What the fuck?

199
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:20,800
- Well, well, well, I would
have never expected that.

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,367
- I'm not no dummy, y'all.

201
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,934
Alyssa is the best dancer,

202
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,133
and she's going to be
on my team.

203
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,433
- Hi, Jinkx.
You go next.

204
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,066
- Ivy Winters.

205
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:33,133
- [laughing]

206
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,200
- Detox.

207
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
- [laughs]

208
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
- Lineysha.

209
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
- Lineysha.

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,967
- Honey Mahogany.

211
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,100
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

212
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,066
- A-loose-ka.

213
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,066
- [laughs]

214
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,066
- Oh, wow.

215
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,567
All right, Coco.

216
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,767
- God, Jade is never going to

217
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,333
forgive me for this.

218
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,066
Roxxxy Andrews.

219
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,300
- Whoo.

220
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,333
- In the back of my mind,

221
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,467
I kind of felt that I would be

222
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,300
one of the first people
that she would choose.

223
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,900
It kind of was like a slap
to my face,

224
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
because we have been so close.

225
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,467
- All right, now, Vivienne
and Jade remain.

226
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,066
Jinkx, who do you pick?

227
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,333
- Jade Jolie.

228
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,333
- Jade Jolie goes to
Jinkx's team,

229
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,266
which leaves
Vivienne Pinay to Coco's team.

230
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,233
- Great.

231
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,934
I find myself again in a team

232
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,667
with a bunch of loudmouths.

233
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,367
- Now, remember, this week...

234
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,967
actions speak louder than words.

235
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,633
Gentlemen, start your engines,

236
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,633
and may the best woman win.

237
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,266
- All right, I would like to
read through the script

238
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,367
before we assign any parts.

239
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,100
I feel a ton of pressure being
team captain,

240
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,567
but I kind of
built myself up last week,

241
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,567
and I don't want to take
a step backwards.

242
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:54,400
All right, I'm thinking young Ru
and Diana Ross.

243
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,633
Then we have Lady Bunny
and gender fuck drag Ru.

244
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,633
- Yeah.

245
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,266
- Does everyone feel good
about this?

246
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,667
- I feel awesome about it.
- Okay.

247
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,233
- I've worked with
Lady Bunny before.

248
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,066
I've made a couple costumes
for her,

249
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,567
and I've gotten to know her
pretty well.

250
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,200
- Ru's mom, you're going to be
the comic relief

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,633
right from the get-go.

252
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:16,100
- I'm the first impression
in this ballet,

253
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,667
and I can't dance.

254
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,600
- Have you had
any formal dance training?

255
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
- [mumbles]

256
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
- [laughs]

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
- Can you krump dance, though?

258
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,066
- No, what is that?

259
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,934
- You know, the--

260
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,667
I know you can do that.

261
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:34,333
- This is--that's my
only dance move.

262
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,834
It's going to be a problem.

263
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,800
- Coming up...

264
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,100
- We'll make you big.

265
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,667
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru though, right?

266
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,333
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.

267
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,233
- Oh. Oh.

268
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,834
- Fuck.

269
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,900
- [laughs]

270
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,967
- [laughs]

271
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,800
- Today, our main challenge
is<i> No Rupaulogies,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> the ballet,</i>

272
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,400
which is the story
of Rupaul's life.

273
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,133
I picked Alyssa for my team.

274
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,100
This could go
really, really good,

275
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,266
or this could go way south.

276
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,266
- In the first scene, there's
a good Ru and a bad Ru,

277
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,100
so there are two Ru's.

278
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,300
- I think it will be good

279
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,567
if we played the good Ru
and the bad Ru.

280
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,567
Ru versus Ru.

281
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,767
- Oh.

282
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,300
Oh, I see where this is going.

283
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,667
- Scene three is
"All my legendary children,

284
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,166
Ru and
America's next drag."

285
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,433
You gonna do Ru?

286
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,400
- I guess.

287
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,734
That's fine.

288
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,700
I think Vivienne should be

289
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,533
America's next drag superstar.

290
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,400
- Okay, that's fine.

291
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,066
- Once again, I'm in a team
with Roxxxy Andrews.

292
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,433
I don't like being
paired with her.

293
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,467
I just don't.

294
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,467
I don't like her energy.

295
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:50,767
- We'll put big earrings
on you.

296
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,934
Jewels, jewels, jewels,
and just the dress

297
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,867
and the shoes and the--

298
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,166
we'll make you big.

299
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,500
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru, though, right?

300
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,000
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.

301
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,367
- Oh. Oh.

302
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,967
- I feel like the team today is
really underestimating me.

303
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,667
I'm kind of just waiting for it
to blow.

304
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:15,500
- Hello, hello, hello, hello,
my private dancers.

305
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,533
all: Hello.

306
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,433
- Is everything beautiful
at the drag ballet?

307
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,734
all: yeah.

308
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:23,600
- Of course.
- I don't believe you.

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,734
[all laughing]

310
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:28,367
Team Jinkx, who have you
assigned the roles to?

311
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:31,467
- Well, we have Ivy
as the Lady Bunny.

312
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:34,266
We have Alaska
as Mama Ernestine.

313
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,266
- [laughs]

314
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,066
- I'm your mama.
- Yes, you are.

315
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,600
- And we have Jade
as little Ru.

316
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I am playing gender fuck
21-year-old Ru.

317
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,767
- Oh, dear.
- Yes.

318
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,900
- And who is playing
'60s Diana Ross?

319
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
- That would be Miss Lineysha
here.

320
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,166
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?

321
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,467
- Um, not really, no.

322
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:55,533
- All right.

323
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,300
Now, Ivy, you have
history with Lady Bunny.

324
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,266
- I do.

325
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:59,367
- I've always wanted to know.

326
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,800
I know you make costumes
for her.

327
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
- Uh-huh.

328
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,633
- What is Lady Bunny's
real waist size?

329
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:06,700
- She's a 28.

330
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,633
[laughs]

331
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,767
- Ooh, you mean her thigh
is a 28.

332
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,066
[all laughing]

333
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,233
- Now, Ernestine is Alaska.

334
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,934
Where are you drawing
inspiration?

335
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,967
- Well, in the voiceover,

336
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,300
it's going to say that she had
a mouth like a sailor, so...

337
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,633
- Yes, she did.

338
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,533
Her favorite saying was...

339
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,934
"You pussy-mouthed
motherfucker.”

340
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,066
- [laughs]

341
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,367
- I'm going to attempt to
convey

342
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,633
with my flailing limbs

343
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:36,667
Ernestine's strictness,
her strength,

344
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:40,900
and a face that's like this.

345
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,066
- All right, kids.

346
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm going to let you get back
to rehearsal.

347
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,967
Good luck.
all: Thank you.

348
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,667
- Hey, team Coco.

349
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,734
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?

350
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,900
Now, which Rupaul
are you playing?

351
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,867
- I am the good Ru,
and alyssa's the bad Ru.

352
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,066
- [laughs]

353
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,467
Now, is this a case
of life imitating art?

354
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,433
- Yeah.

355
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,900
- How did that come about?

356
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,900
'Cause I was pretty gobsmacked
when you chose Alyssa.

357
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,367
I thought that you guys
had a little thing.

358
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,500
- Well, this is a competition,

359
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,734
and like I said,
I'm playing to win.

360
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:14,633
- Now, who's playing
'90s supermodel Ru?

361
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,900
- Me.

362
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,200

00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,533
- I do want to see other sides
to Jinkx

895
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,867
that I don't think
we've gotten to yet.

896
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,433
- If she can pull off
the glamazon,

897
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,433
we've got a real contender
on our hands.

898
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,467
- Her dancing wasn't
phenomenal,

899
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,667
but I think she
really made up for that

900
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,433
with committing
to her character.

901
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:58,967
- Ivy Winters.

902
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:01,100
- Nobody's more in on the joke
than Bunny,

903
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,300
and Ivy really
played that well.

904
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,734
- Did Lady Bunny ever lift you
up like that, Ru?

905
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,633
- Usually I saw her going down.

906
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,767
[laughter]

907
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,133
Roxxxy Andrews.

908
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,533
- She's out there playing you.

909
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,333
Honest to God, it's been so long

910
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,166
since I've seen you go out
in a leotard.

911
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,066
- She had a tall order
to play you now,

912
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,633
and the "it" thing
that you've got,

913
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:24,266
I didn't see up on the stage.

914
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,567
- All right, up next
is Honey Mahogany.

915
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:31,100
Now, here she is, playing
my idol, Diana Ross.

916
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,633
- I found myself watching
Detox the whole time.

917
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,533
- Tonight,
she comes up here again

918
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,200
with a sequin kaftan,

919
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,500
and this, you know, hodge podge.

920
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
It was all just whatever.

921
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,567
- Alyssa Edwards,
who is a trained dancer.

922
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,300
Regardless of her technique

923
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
and her background as a dancer,

924
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,633
she had the story in her head,

925
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:51,633
and we could see that.

926
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:53,266
- I mean,
she just looked so hot,

927
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,533
and I love her walk.

928
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,066
- She danced from head to toe,

929
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:57,333
between her hands and her toes.

930
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,166
Everything, she articulated
through her entire body,

931
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,233
and it was amazing.

932
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,066
- All right, moving on to
Vivienne Pinay.

933
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,533
- Talk about not delivering.

934
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:07,533
Even being the crowned drag
superstar--

935
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,500
No, you weren't.

936
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,934
- Yeah.
Yeah.

937
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,200
- You were just a regular girl

938
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,467
putting a crown on at the mall.

939
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:14,934
- Silence!

940
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:17,266
I've made my decision.

941
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:22,066
Bring back my girls.

942

[laughs]

944
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,066
- Welcome back, ladies.

945
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:31,100
This week,
you were all dance troupers,

946
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,500
but one of you stood out
as the prima drag ballerina.

947
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,567
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...

948
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,333
Alyssa Edwards.

949
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,633
[all applauding]

950
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:50,567
You've won a custom feather
piece from Mother Plucker,

951
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:55,066
and you'll receive immunity
from elimination next week.

952
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,367
- I'm at a loss for words,

953
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,533
and that doesn't happen much.

954
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm just very thankful.

955
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,867
- Ivy Winters...

956
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,266
you're safe.

957
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,500
- Thank you all.

958
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,433
- Jinkx Monsoon.

959
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:10,667
You're safe.

960
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:14,767
- Thank you.

961
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,700
- Honey Mahogany,

962
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,433
as Diana Ross,
we were not swept away.

963
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:24,100
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.

964
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,867
Roxxxy Andrews, we challenged
you to step it up,

965
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:31,633
and you fell short.

966
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:34,700
Vivienne Pinay,
you are making progress,

967
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
but this week,

968
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,133
it was not measured
in leaps and bounds.

969
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,834
Roxxxy Andrews...

970
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,567
you are safe.

971
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,233
- Thank you.

972
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,867
I'm so sorry.

973
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:54,333
- You may join the other girls.

974
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,300
- Vivienne Pinay,

975
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,166
I'm sorry, my dear,

976
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:00,333
but you are up for elimination.

977
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,533
Two queens stand before me.

978
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:07,066
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

979
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:11,867
and save yourself
from elimination.

980
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,533
The time has come.

981
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:17,800
You need to lip sync
for your life.

982
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,066
- The anger that I have
is preventing me

983
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,567
from being nervous.

984
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:25,700
Fuck it.

985
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm going to do it
to the best of my ability,

986
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,734
because I owe it to myself.

987
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:30,800
- Good luck,

988
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,900

1028
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:32,367
there has never been
a double elimination.

1029
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:33,734

1030
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:34,700
Of course, it is.

Why wouldn't it be?

1032
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:40,867
- Now, ladies, sashay away.

1033
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,367
- I do have talent,
and I do have,

I think, what it takes
to be a performer.

If I could do something

1036

I would have not worn
this kaftan.

Maybe I just need to
hire a stylist.

1038

1039
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,266
because I want to be here
to the end,

1040

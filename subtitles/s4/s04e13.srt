who I thought

would make the top three.

104

- Well, I'll be honest,
I'm shocked

three.

106

does not deserve to be
in the top three?

111

- I would say Phi Phi.

112
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,767
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

113
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,333
- Bullshit.

- Are you guys feeling okay
about everything, or...

115
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,066
- Oh, I still hate both
of y'all.

116

- I think there was
a misunderstanding.

117
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,700
- We basically can agree
to disagree.

118
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,533
When it boils down to it,

119
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,633

00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,500
Okay, stop.

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,967
You're spinning twice.
- Okay.

183
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,533
- So you should only spin
once there.

184
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,467
- Got it. Sorry.

185
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,433
Can you tell I'm shaking?

186
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,633
- It's okay.
It's all right.

187
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,433
- So why don't we start
one by one.

188
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,300
We'll start with you, Phi Phi.
- Okay.

189
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,934
- One, two, three, and four.

190
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,400
Five, stop, hit, hit.

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,667
Phi Phi, she's great;
she has the steps,

192
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:33,400
but she's also
a little cha-cha.

193
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,867
Let's try you, Chad.

194
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,467
One, two, three, and four.

195
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

196
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,967
It's a little too, uh, girly.

197
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,066
Let's try you.

198
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,066
- All right.

199
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,500
- It doesn't have to be pretty.

200
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,433
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,500
Thank God.
No.

202
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,200
[laughing] I'm teasing.

203
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,166
I'm joking, I'm joking.

204
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,266
One, two, three, and four.

205
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,200
Okay, let me just go over it
with you.

206
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,734
So just look at my feet.

207
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,900
I'm most worried about Sharon.

208
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,800
If you don't get the steps down,

209
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,500
you can't perform the video.

210
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,166
And then on this leg, you go,

211
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,934
step, step, step.

212
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,567
- Step, step...

213
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,767
Oh, goodness.

214
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,433
It's just so fast.

215
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,233
I am intimidated
that the other girls

216
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,867
are picking this up
a lot quicker than me.

217
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,700
This is just far too difficult.

218
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,467
- I just want you guys to do
the best you can do, okay?

219
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:25,800
- It's hard.

220
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,266
- Let's beat this face, ladies.

221
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,133
- Now it's time to
change into our

222
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,467
beautiful monster outfits
for the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>

223
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:37,066
- And this really is gonna be
the coolest video.

224
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,433
- Our looks for the music video

225
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:43,633
are kind of a mixture between
1950s B-horror films

226
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,900
meets an issue of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>

227
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,967
Work.

228
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
You know what those monster
costumes remind me of?

229
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
- What?
- GWAR.

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,967
- Uh-huh.

231
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,633
- What's GWAR?

232
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,934
- "What's GWAR?"

233
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:58,266
- Talk about edgy.

234
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:02,767
- GWAR is, like, some crazy
'80s, like,

235
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,333
pop punk metal band,

236
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,934
but they wear
all latex monster costumes.

237
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,667
- Oh, why would I know that,
though?

238
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,333
- Because it's drag.

239
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,133
- Yeah, well...

240
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,867
- Oh.

241
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,066
- Coming from "never seen
<i>Paris is Burning."</i>

242
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,700
- I fell asleep.
- Ah!

243
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,133
As drag queens, I think of
ourselves as funhouse mirrors.

244
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,667
We reflect pop culture
back to the world,

245
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,066
and I think to be America's
next drag superstar,

246
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,767
you have to be exactly that.

247
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,700
- Fell asleep during
<i>Paris is Burning.</i>

248
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,667
- I was tired.

249
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,667
Chad and Sharon, they're old.

250
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,700
Screw them.

251
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,667
Let them watch their TV.

252
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,800
I have better things to do,

253
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,867
like become America's
next drag superstar.

254
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,233
- Candis Cayne
was an amazing instructor.

255
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,233
- I love that dance.

256
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,500
I thought the dance was fun.

257
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,467
- I hate it.

258
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,166
I just don't dance like that.

259
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,166
It freaks me out.

260
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,266
- Yeah, 'cause, I mean,

261
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,967
at this point,
we have to be perfect.

262
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,600
At this point, I kind of hope
Sharon messes up.

263
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,700
I want to win this.

264
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,667
- See, that's the shot.

265
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,333
- It is time,
ladies and gentlemen.

266
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,567
We're gonna start serving

267
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:08,066
Godzilla realness.

268
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,166
- And cue.

269
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,667
- ♪ Female phenomenon ♪

270
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,033

273
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,967
Honey, help that girl.

274
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,433
Sharon needs to stay
on her line.

275
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,166
- Huh?
- You're drifting in to Chad.

276
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,934
Try your best to stay straight.

277
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,200
- If you drift out of it,

278
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,767
the shot's kind of fucked
for everyone.

279
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,800
- All right.

280
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,533
- One, two, three, four.

281
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,767
Five, stop, hit, hit.

282
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,934

283

- Was I a little better?

285
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,433
- It was only one "wah" as

286
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,800
opposed to two "wah."

287
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,133
♪ Wah wah ♪

288
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,867
- It's just one song, Sharon.

289
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,700
- It needs to be together.

290
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,433
- We cannot
drop the ball on this.

291
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,400
- Action.

296
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,500
- We're jumping ship.

297
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,767
You're supposed to go
in the front,

298
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:02,767
she goes in the back,

299
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:03,734
I cut through the middle.

300
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:06,066
So it's that easy.

301
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,367
- I feel like I'm on
<i>Candid Camera,</i>

302
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,800
and I'm the butt of the joke.

303
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,367
- Let's get through
the fucking dance

304
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,633
in the half an hour that
we've got to do it in.

305
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,166
- [whispering] Jesus Christ.

306
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,600
Sharon needs to get this,

307
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,066
and she needs to get it now.

308
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,667
- Oh, fuck, fuck me.

309
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,633
- This is gonna be
a crap video.

310
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,233
- Hi, Phi Phi.

311
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,433
- Hi, Chad.

312
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:39,333
- After the choreography
debacle yesterday,

313
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,800
it's important for me to do well

314
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,333
in the rest of
the music video.

315
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,467
- What's on the mirror?

316
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,900
- It says, "Meet us
in the ladies' room."

317
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,300
- Who's "us"?

318
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,066
- Could it be, like, some of
the departed girls?

319
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,333
- [feigns sobbing]

320
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,333
- What do you think it is?

321
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,533
- I don't even know.

322
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,934
- Let's go.
- Let's go check it out.

323
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,533
Oh, god.

324
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,567
- [chuckling]

325
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,934
- [gasps]

326
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,400
both: Surprise!

327
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,066
[laughter]

328
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,734
- It's Tyra and Raja,

329
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,533
winners of season two
and three.

330
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,633
- Hi, mama.

331
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,800
- Hi, baby.
I'm gonna cry.

332
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,834
Hold on.

333
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,066
- Raja and I,
we've worked together

334
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,667
for ten-plus years.

335
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,433
And I just have
a lot of love for Raja.

336
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,500
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

337
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,166
- We've got one more little
twist to share with you.

338
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,500
- You'll be acting with
Miss RuPaul herself.

339
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,467
- Cool.

340
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,700
- In a face-slapping,

341
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,500
gut-punching, kick-ass scene.

342
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,834
- Work.

343
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:37,233
- Oh...and you'll be having
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.

344
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,400
So a little piece of
sisterly advice.

345
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,266
both: Don't fuck it up.

346
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,433
- Oh, I'm starving, Ru.

347
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,367
- Oh, good.

348
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,734
- How are you?
- I'm terrific.

349
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:50,834
- You look so beautiful.

350
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,066
- Now you get to see me
up close and personal.

351
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,066
- [laughs]

352
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,233
And, by the way,
if you're hungry,

353
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,533
just have a bite.

354
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,700
- Well, actually, I haven't
eaten since 1972, Ru.

355
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,834
That's how I stay thin.

356
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,667
- Oh, good for you.
- Isn't that great?

357
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,633
- I want to ask you,

358
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,967
over the course of your time
here,

359
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,667
people, Michelle,
talked about, um,

360
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:07,767
you being so perfect.

361
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:08,700
- Right.

362
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,867
- Because you're very poised,

363
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,100
and you say
all the right things.

364
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,633
And I think she just
wanted to see

365
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,367
that vulnerable edge
that every superstar has.

366
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,633
- I'm me all the time.

367
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,133
And if it's not edgy enough,
then so be it.

368
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,266
- Now, are your parents
still with us?

369
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,533
- Yes, my parents are with us.

370
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,066
I actually live with my mom.

371
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,934
My father is nearby,

372
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,200
but, um, still a little bit
estranged.

373
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,367
- Why is that?

374
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,433
- It's been a long 25 years of,

375
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,066
um, me not forgiving.

376
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:42,133
I felt like my father really
chose another family over--

377
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,433
over me and my mom.

378
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,433
And it's just recently that...

379
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm realizing how much it
affected me.

380
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,166
- How does it manifest?

381
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,333
- Sometimes, it's easy for me
to disconnect from things.

382
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,166
And not...

383
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,767
really face my own feelings
about my father.

384
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:00,266
- Is it possible that
the invulnerability

385
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:01,600
that Michelle
is talking about

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,100
is exactly what
you're describing?

387
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,066
- Could be.

388
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,867
- I bet that's what it is.

389
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:10,633
I'm just wondering if that is
your breakthrough moment

390
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,867
in terms of
not only this contest,

391
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,266
but, you know, in your life.

392
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,500
- It could very well be.

393
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,233
- Thank you so much, Chad.

394
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,500
- Thank you, Ru,
it's been an honor to be here.

395
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,400
- Take these for the road.

396
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,533
- Thank you, darling.

397
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,200
I'll see you on the runway.
- All right.

398
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,867
- All right, mama.

399
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,500
- What's going on?

400
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,200
- Oh, other than
losing my mind?

401
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,233
I'm having a hell of a time.

402
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,433
- All you need to remember
is that right now,

403
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,900
you're in the heat
of the competition,

404
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
there's only three of you left,

405
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,166
but once this is all done,

406
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,166
regardless if you win
and get that prize

407
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,433
and the crown
and so on,

408
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,333
your life is about to
absolutely fucking change.

409
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,900
- Right.

410
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,567
- Of course it's better to win.

411
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,333
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's better to win.

412
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,500
- Yes, yes.

413
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,333
- Well, you know,
I'm used to being a loser,

414
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,066
but I really hope that I do win.

415
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,967
I want to let every loser
out there know

416
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,900
that there can be a giant crown
on their head.

417
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,867
There are so many of me's,

418
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,867
all around the world.

419
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:05,066
People who want to
express themselves

420
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,066
in unconventional ways.

421
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,333
If I win<i> RuPaul's Drag race,</i>

422
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,900
it will definitely show them

423
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,834
that anything is possible.

424
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,934
- Let's just go over
some of it.

425
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:20,734
- All I ever wanted was to be
a female phenomenon.

426
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:21,900
- [laughing]

427
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,667
I like the fact that you can
modify your voice,

428
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,100
'cause I've never
had that talent.

429
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,467
- I modify my voice
all the time.

430
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,133
- Yeah.
[laughs]

431
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,200
- Girl.

432
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,633
- I'll be Ru.
You ready?

433
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,500
- Uh-huh.
- You sure?

434
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,934
- Punch her! Hit her! Get her!

435
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,600
- Ohh!
- Hey! Yes!

436
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,266
- Uhh! Oh!

437
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,400
- Damn bitch knocked
my bracelet off.

438
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,867
- Work!
That was awesome.

439
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:43,934
- ♪ Legendary ♪

440
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,800
Ohh!

441
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,066
- Phi Phi, darling!

442
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,133
- You look amazing.

443
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,734
- Oh, you're just saying that.

444
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,800
- No, for real.

445
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
- Are you hungry?
- I'm hungry.

446
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,266
- Well, that's what
everyone says--

447
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,834
you're so hungry and
ambitious.

448
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,367
- I have a drive,
and I have a strong drive,

449
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,400
and I really
wanted to prove to you guys

450
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,934
and show you guys,
especially you,

451
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,600
that I can do whatever it takes.

452
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
- Does that come from having
an army dad,

453
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,767
where you feel like,

454
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,166
"I want daddy's approval"?

455
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,433
- I mean, I haven't talked to
him for seven years now.

456
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,667
- What was the last thing
you said to him?

457
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,400
- It was a fight, actually.

458
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,066
I-I don't even remember.

459
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,934
I was put in the hospital.

460
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,400
- By him?

461
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,767
- By him, on my 18th birthday,

462
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,133
so I haven't--

463
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,667
there wasn't many words.

464
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,667
[laughs] So...

465
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,066
- Wow.

466
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,867
- But I'm here!

467
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,900
So--so it's okay.

468
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,533
If anything, it taught me to be,

469
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,266
you know, a fighter and stay
strong and...

470
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,934
I guess, because I grew up in
such a situation,

471
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,500
I feel like maybe
it felt like

472
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,333
it was normal at times, but...

473
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,633
I shouldn't have felt that way.

474
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,967
- I want you to walk away
from this luncheon

475
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,400
and remember this idea
that you would deserve

476
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
to be abused

477
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,200
or not thought of
as absolutely beautiful,

478
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,633
never think that again.

479
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,967
- I really feel like
we connected,

480
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,467
and she understands
a lot more of the heart

481
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,200
of who I am.

482
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,333
- So, um, what's it been like
so far?

483
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,433
Who's your biggest competition?

484
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:05,433
- Sharon Needles.

485
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:07,934
We're like kindred spirits.
- Yeah.

486
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:08,800
- And, um...

487
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,967
- Have you guys ki-kied?

488
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,467
- [laughing] No, we have not
ki-kied.

489
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,533
- What's your relationship like
with Phi Phi?

490
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,233
- She's definitely comin'
after me.

491
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,400
But it's okay!

492
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,467
You know, we got a big age
difference between us.

493
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,266
And I've commented on Phi Phi's
maturity level,

494
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,433
but I also have
to remember she's 25,

495
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,100
and I remember when I was 25.

496
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,734
- Well, I'm 23.

497
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:32,967
- You're that young?
- Yeah.

498
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,934
- Jesus Christ.
- Only 23.

499
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,567
- And look at your position.

500
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,934
- Though we've had our spats,

501
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,300
maybe I'm not tolerating
that amazing kid

502
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,266
for who she is.

503
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,533
- So really just go for it

504
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,867
and be larger than life
about it.

505
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,066
You know?

506
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,834
- You promised to make me
a panther on the runway.

507
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,166
- Well, stand in line, girly.

508
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,700
- Slap her!

509
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,533
Uhh! Yeah!

510
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,300
Ohh! There you go.

511
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,233
Woooork.

512
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,400
- If I knew it was so formal,
I would have changed.

513
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,300
- [laughing]

514
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,800
- You look absolutely stunning.

515
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
- Why, thank you.

516
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
- Even from this close,

517
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,467
you can't clock a lace-front,
girl.

518
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:10,667
You gotta love that.

519
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,633
I'm just--I'm looking
for a problem.

520
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,633
- Well, there are several.

521
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:20,066
So, now, Sharon, I know you have
people back in Pittsburgh

522
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,900
that you love
and that you're worried about

523
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,500
what this experience would
do to the relationship.

524
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
- Oh, most definitely.

525
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,066
- We're talking about Alaska,
aren't we?

526
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,567
- Alaska has tried out for this
competition all four years.

527
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:37,633
I've tried out for this
competition once--this year.

528
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,967
I just wish I could
speak to him,

529
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,433
you know, and just see
if it was okay.

530
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,400
- What would you say?

531
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,233
I'm Alaska.
What would you say?

532
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,633
- I love you so much
and, in my eyes,

533
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:49,066
you're the biggest
superstar in the universe.

534
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,900
I just pray this doesn't
do any damage.

535
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,967
- I'm gonna tell you what
Alaska would say.

536
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,567
It's fine.

537
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,734
I would never stand in the way
of your success,

538
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,333
which is your destiny.

539
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,333
- Hmm.

540
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,567
- And Alaska has a destiny.

541
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,900
We all have a journey,

542
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,200
and it is up to you
to see it through.

543
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,100
- RuPaul gives nothing more
than good advice.

544
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,200
But I definitely have a fear of
success and fame.

545
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,700
It intimidates me.

546
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,433
- All right, see you later.

547
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,633
- [mouth full] Yes, ma'am.

548
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,333
- Needles.

549
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,133
How'd it go, mama?

550
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,500
What's wrong, baby?

551
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,667
Aww.
[chuckles]

552
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:35,367
It's okay. It's okay.

553
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,867
- Touching little witch.

554
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:37,934
- [laughs]

555
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,066
- God!

556
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,433
I knew this was all
coming to an end,

557
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,967
and it was the first time
I really realized

558
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,367
that everything truly
is going to be different.

559
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,700
And this is a big deal.

560
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Oh, jeez, Louise.

561
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,066
- What's goin' on?

562
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,300
- Not much. Top three.

563
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,533
- Yeah!
Whoo hoo hoo!

564
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,667
- I know, it's crazy.

565
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,066
- Do you think
that you being young

566
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,900
has been a challenge for you
in this competition?

567
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,233
- Well, I'm 25.

568
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,467
I think a lot of people use that
as kind of like a...

569
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,400
like an excuse, really.

570
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,667
And I don't let that--

571
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,333
- Well, when I did the show,
I was 21.

572
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,667
So don't let anyone, like,
hold you back.

573
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,667
- Oh, I haven't.

574
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,100
- Being young is being fun.

575
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,300
- Just like me, everybody was
ganging up on Tyra

576
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,467
because she was the baby,

577
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,000
or they felt like she had
too much attitude.

578
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,767
So the fact that someone can win
at a young age

579
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,266
and still be a great role model

580
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,000
and America's next drag
superstar,

581
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
why can't I?

582
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,867
- Now sashay!

583
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,934
- Uhh!

584
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,767
- Shante!
- Ohh!

585
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,500
- Shante! Shante! Shante!

586
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
- Aah!

587
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,767
- ♪ Oscar ♪

588
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,934
- Why does the little one
get beat up?

589
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,500
Uhh!

590
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,934
- Wonder how ol'
Phi Phi's doing.

591
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,367
- Disneying it up somewhere.

592
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,066
- In a way,
I feel bad about, like,

593
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,133
saying some of the shit
I said to her.

594
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,433
I feel bad.

595
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,200
- Yeah, I know.

596
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,934
- Who the fuck am I
to tell her to grow up?

597
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:59,133
- [humming]

598
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,867
- How was it?

599
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,133
- It went really, really well.

600
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,100
- I just want to say something
to you.

601
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,667
- To me?

602
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,600
- [crying] I'm sorry for saying
for you to grow up, because...

603
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,066
I know that you're just a kid,

604
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,900
and you deserve to be 25

605
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,333
and have fun and be stupid
and flippant and crazy

606
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,934
and blow it out, because,
before you know it,

607
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,066
you're gonna be 40.

608
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,800
And I love you for who you are.

609
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,767
- [tearful chuckle]

610
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:24,767
- And everything you aren't.

611
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,066
I'm sorry.

612
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:26,967
- Don't cry.

613
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,066
Ah, give me a hug.
Mmm.

614
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,400
- I'm sorry.

615
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,934
- I'm sorry
I'm annoying sometimes.

616
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:32,934
- You're not, though.

617
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,533
You're not.

618
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,834
- I'm not sorry,
but I like you.

619
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:37,834
- [laughing] Shut up.

620
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,166
We really are sisters.

621
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,467
No matter how different we are,

622
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,300
as much as we probably
don't want to admit it,

623
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,600
we're a family.

624
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,967
[clapper snaps]

625
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,433
- Gorgeous.

626
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,567
- It's time to shoot our scenes
with RuPaul.

627
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,333
It's very exciting.

628
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,133
- Here we go.

629
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,166
First positions, please.

630
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,066
If you don't do it properly,

631
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,900
the dog's going to die.

632
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
- [laughs]

633
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,667
- Action.

634

[triumphant music]

635
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:13,066
When you hit your marks,
defiant.

636
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,266
- Not so fast, "Rude Paul."

637
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,667
- Yeah, get a load of us,

638
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,166
stupid-model of the world.

639
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,300
- Yeah, grandpa!

640
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,400
We're here to throw a wrench
in your plans.

641
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,834
Uhh!

642
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,066
[clang]

643
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:30,166
- Bitch, that wrench came
awful close to this face.

644
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,500
- [laughs]

645
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,967
Try not to hit RuPaul.

646
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,066
Action.

647
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:37,433
- You had no intention
of giving up your crown.

648
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,500
- You'd love to replace me,
wouldn't you?

649
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,967
Well, take a number
and stand in line!

650
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,900
- Uhh!
- And cut.

651
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,100
Slap her.

652
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,834
I didn't believe that
for a second.

[beep]

654
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,734
- Chad Michaels
is a little prissy.

655
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:54,967
- Ouch!

656
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,133
- But she takes direction well.

657
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,133
She's slapping you.

658
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:59,166
That's gotta hurt.

659
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,600
- Ohh! Oh!

660
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
Oh! Uhh...

661
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,934
Oh! Ooh!

662
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,100
- Beautiful!

663
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,200
- Uhh!

664
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,800
- I very much appreciate
Chad's efforts.

665
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,533
- Are you all right, darling?
- I love it.

666
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:11,567
- [laughing]

667
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,600
- Okay.

668
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,567
Which brings us along
to Sharon Needles.

669
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,767
- Uh-huh.
- Sell it to me.

670
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,066
- Whatever happened to,

671
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,400
"Everybody say love"?

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
- Sharon, you should
probably go, "uhh," forward.

675
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,333
- Got it.

676
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,333
Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?

Ah! Ugh!

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Agh!

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
- Everybody say love.

682
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,667
- Anyone who gets
the opportunity

683
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,200
to have RuPaul kick
the shit out of them

684
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,900
should consider themselves
a very lucky individual.

685
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

686
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,333
- Yes, sir.

687
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,066
- It's your turn to shine.

688
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:51,500
- This is my last time that
I can really impress Ru,

689
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,133
so I don't want to mess this up.

690
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,133
I wanna win this.

691
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,333
- Action.

692
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,667
- And you, my pretty?

693
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,867
- RuPaul, what happened

694
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,433
to that innocent kid
from the Brewster projects

695
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:06,133
with the pair of heels
and--and a dream?

696
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,867
- And cut.

697
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:12,233
Can we ratchet that back
just a few notches?

698
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,200
It was a little Dorothy,
<i>Wizard of Oz</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on crack.</i>

699
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,467
- [chuckles] Okay.

700
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:24,233
What happened to that
supermodel of the world?

701
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,967
Ohh! Aah! Ohh!

[groaning]

703
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,734
- Good girl, Phi Phi.

704
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,166
Let's do it one more time.

705
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,567
On your marks...

706
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:34,867

708
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,433
- Well, take a number
and stand in line.

709
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:39,700
- Ohh!

710
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,467
This competition, it's like
graduating high school

711
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,800
and going to Yale.

712
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
- Ohh!

713
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,166
- It's taken 18 years
to get here,

714
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,400
and it's validation
and redemption.

715
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,700

I was in love once.

899
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:15,066
It was the worst 20 minutes
of my life.

900

901
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,367
Hyuh! Ah!

902
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,867
Uhh! Hyuh!

903
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:22,266
Ohh!

[groans]

905
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:26,834
- Everybody say love.

906
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,133
And you, my pretty?

907
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,767
- RuPaul, what happened to that

908
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,533
innocent kid from
the Brewster projects

909
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:39,400
who became a shining example
for dreamers everywhere?

910
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,934
What happened to that supermodel
of the world?

911
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,066
- You're right.

912
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:51,734
I am that supermodel
of the world.

913
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,333
- Ohh! Aah!

914
00:31:56,333 --> 00:32:00,367
Oww! Oww! Uhh! Ahh!

915
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,500
- Now...sashay...

916
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,800
- Ohh!

917
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,867
- Shante!

918
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:06,333
- Ohh!

919
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,433
- Shante, shante, shante!

920
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:10,700
- Aah!

921
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,100
- My super size queen
glamazon spray

922
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,166
should take effect any moment.

923
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,467
First, you'll destroy the world.

924
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:28,433
Then you'll destroy each other.

925
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,066
[laughing]

926
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,333
May the best glamazon win.

[laughter]

929
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
- All right.

930
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
- Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,

931
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,066
Sharon Needles...

- Wow, beautiful.

956
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,967
- The one thing I can count on
Chad doing well is,

957
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,533
you do this thing where
everything has a flourish.

958
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:42,567
- It's all this, girl.

959
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,533
- Yes! Oh, my god!

960
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,934
I could watch you do that
forever!

961
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:45,967
- It's old-school.

962
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,166
- Don't ever stop doing that.

963
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,266
- I don't think I can,
'cause it's, like,

964
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,834
one of three tricks
that I have.

965
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,233
[laughter]

966
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:52,333
- Old-school or not,

967
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,567
it's really refreshing
to watch you.

968
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,667
- Oh! Ohh!

969
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:57,900
- You played well with Ru.

970
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,633
I thought you were
very convincing.

971
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:03,367
It was funny, and I actually
wish some of that

972
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,333
lightheartedness
and your sense of humor

973
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,500
would have been
in your monster stomping.

974
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,867
- Next up, Sharon Needles.

975
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,433
- I'm so glad that you came out
tonight

976
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,633
for the finale in your
California natural look.

977
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,166
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

978
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,266
Yeah, this is succubus
ready to wear.

979
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,467
- I love your stomping monster.

980
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,967
Very campy.

981
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,700
- But the choreography
and the dancing,

982
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,066
it was a little rough.

983
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,734
It looked a little shaky
in parts.

984
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,166
- When dancing
isn't your thing,

985
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,400
you can either own it,

986
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,066
or you can really fail.

987
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:36,100
You gotta be ready for
any challenge, you know?

988
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,266
- All right, Phi Phi O'Hara.

989
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,266
- I'll start with your
runway look tonight,

990
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,333
because I love it.

991
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,266
- Oh, thank you.

992
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:43,734
- Your stomping, that was
probably

993
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,100
your weakest thing,

994
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
'cause it looked more like
you were doing a runway.

995
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,767
I just got like, "I'm cute,
I'm fierce, let me walk."

996
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,767
- But I think your dance moves

997
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,600
were very tight and on beat.

998
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,934
Your range of energy was really

999
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:57,567
unbelievable in that video.

1000
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,533
- Thank you, Phi Phi.

1001
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,066
While you
and the other girls untuck

1002
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,200
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

1003
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,834
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1004
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:11,066
All right, just between us
"goils," what do you think?

1005
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,066
- Oh, Ru.

1006
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,800
- This is it, and they all
represent

1007
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,734
three different
factions of drag.

1008
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,066
Phi Phi is the ingénue newcomer.

1009
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,233
Chad, the professional diva.

1010
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:23,266
And Sharon Needles,
the little monster.

1011
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:27,467
They could all represent this
competition so brilliantly.

1012
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,600
- This is a tough one, baby.

1013
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,633
- Let's start with
Sharon Needles.

1014
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,266
- Sharon needles was
an underdog.

1015
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:33,567
She came out here looking like

1016
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,100
Nosferatu on the first show.

1017
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,266
- She won that challenge.

1018
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:38,200
- I know she did,
because she did it fiercely.

1019
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,967
- Sharon always came out here,
week after week,

1020
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:43,667
with something
conceptual and creative.

1021
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,433
And I think that sometimes

1022
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,266
people are scared of things
that are unconventional.

1023
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,533
- I like the goth,
but I feel like,

1024
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,433
"Do you have to do it
all the time?"

1025
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:55,133
I don't know if the entire world
is ready

1026
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:57,700
for somebody to win
this competition

1027
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,967
like a Sharon Needles.

1028
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,700
- Well, listen,
Lady Gaga's done it.

1029
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,834
- Sharon's even beyond
Lady Gaga, I think.

1030
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:04,867
- All right, kids.

1031
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,100
Chad Michaels.

1032
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,900
- There is nobody more
qualified than Chad Michaels.

1033
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,834
The bitch is a<i> professional.</i>

1034
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:17,433
Her representing your show
would be executed perfectly.

1035
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,600
- It's great that Chad probably
had those

1036
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,500
Versace dresses
in her closet from

1037
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,734
the early '90s.

1038
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,533
- Yes, a little old-school,

1039
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,667
but Chad grew up in a different
time period

1040
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,667
where drag was
what Chad does.

1041
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,600
- It's not so much
the age thing,

1042
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,967
'cause Chad is ageless.

1043
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,066
- Age ain't nothin'.

1044
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:37,400
- It's about
evolving constantly

1045
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,433
and looking at what's next
and what's new.

1046
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,567
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

1047
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,100
At one point,
I thought she was too green,

1048
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,567
but, boy, has she grown,

1049
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:48,200
faster than any other competitor
we have ever seen.

1050
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,967
- And what she lacks
in experience,

1051
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,734
she makes up for with drive.

1052
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,533
- If you remember,
she's gotten some heat

1053
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,734
for being too ambitious.

1054
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,066
Do you think that's a bad thing?

1055
00:36:56,066 --> 00:37:00,734
- No, it probably is what's
driving her creativity.

1056
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,367
You know, you see it in the way
that she's evolved.

1057
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,734
- And I feel like with Phi Phi,

1058
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:07,367
she's the new
generation of drag.

1059
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,066
- Silence!

1060
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,967
This ain't over...

1061
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,667
till they lip-synch
for their lives.

1062
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,533
Bring back my girls.

1063
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,600
Welcome back, ladies.

1064
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,400
The moment of truth is upon us.

1065
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,066
Based on your performance
in the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> music video</i>

1066
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:34,200
and your body of work
throughout this competition,

1067
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,700
I've made some decisions.

1068
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,066
Chad Michaels...

1069
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:43,066
you are a seasoned queen.

1070
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:48,300
But do you represent
the future of drag?

1071
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,200
Phi Phi O'Hara,
my beautiful queen...

1072
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,800
in this competition, no one
has ever grown so fast.

1073
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,300
But are you fully prepared

1074
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,900
for the responsibilities
that come with the crown?

1075
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,467
Sharon Needles, you are
as charming as you are scary.

1076
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:12,800
And you shake drag to its core.

1077
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,233
But do you have the right stuff

1078
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,400
to be America's next drag
superstar?

1079
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:26,233
For the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>

1080
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:30,800
we are breaking
all the rules.

1081
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,934
- What?

1082
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:36,600
- Chad, Sharon, Phi Phi.

1083
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,066
The three of you
will lip-synch for your lives.

1084
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:45,200
Three queens stand before me.

1085
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,967
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1086
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,834
and prove to the world

1087
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:56,633
that you are America's
next drag superstar.

1088
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:00,533

I've worked for,

1089
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,600

all I've got.

00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,433

of emotions.

00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,100
But I've never been afraid
of an audience,

1095

start now.

00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,400
BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHO COMES FIRST,

188
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,934
IT'S ABOUT
WHO CAN LAST THE LONGEST.

00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,767
THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST QUEENS TO ARRIVE.

200
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,400
IN FACT, LAST WEEK,

IS BETTER THAN EVER.

207
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,567
BUT ON THE SHADY SIDE,
THERE'S A ONE IN 7 CHANCE

208
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,967
THAT YOU'LL BE ELIMINATED

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
BEFORE YOU EVEN MEET
THE OTHER QUEENS.

210
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,633

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
DON'T YOU?

243

A LOT OF BODY, DON'T YOU?

482
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,834

THAT MICHELLE WILL SAY,

483
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,500

00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,367
HAWAII 5--OH, NO,
SHE BETTER DON'T.

694
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,767
- UH-HUH.
- [LAUGHS]

695
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,200
- DIP INTO THE WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.

696
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,433
- WELL, HELLO, MRS. LAKE.

697
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:55,266
TONIGHT I'M GIVING ON THE RUNWAY
SEVENTIES STUDIO 54 COUTURE.

698
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,734
- WOW.

699
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,033
- SHAKE OUR TITS.

700
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,133
- HELL, YEAH!

701
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,433
- NOW, WHERE IS SHE HIDING
THAT POT OF GOLD?

702
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,800
- AT THE END OF HER RAINBOW.

703
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,333
- HERE COMES
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,

704
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,667
FROM HOEDOWN TO COUTURE.

705
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,133
- HOLSTEIN COUTURE.

706
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,433
- WOULD YOU CALL THAT
A MOO-MOO?

707
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:16,533
- MILK IT.
[MOOS]

708
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:21,367
- I FEEL LIKE HOEDOWN
MEETS HIGH SCHOOL PROM IN 1993.

709
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,600
- SHE'S UDDER-LY FANTASTIC.

710
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,266
- WORK IT, HEIFER.

15 GOING ON FABULOUS!

713
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:35,900
- WHERE THE PARTY AT?

714
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,200
- EVERYWHERE, APPARENTLY.

715
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,100
- [CHUCKLES]
- SANDBAGS.

716
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,867
- I AM SERVING UP FUN,
FLIRTY LIFE-OF-THE-PARTY,

717
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
BECAUSE THAT IS JOSLYN FOX.

00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:47,266

YES, I DO.

719
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,734
- HA!

720
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:49,767
- COURTNEY ACT.

721
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,300
- LOOK AT THAT BIG BOX.
[LAUGHS]

722
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,033
- OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE?

723
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,667
- SHE'S A MEMBER
OF THE TEA BAG PARTY.

724
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,133
- [LAUGHS]

725
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,066
- I'M FEELING LIKE A VIXEN.

726
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,300
I'M BARING FLESH, I'VE GOT LEGS,

727
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,834
I'VE GOT BODY-ODY-ODY.

728
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,033
- OH, YES. SHE'S WALKING
THE PARTY LINE, DARLING.

729
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:09,333
- WORK IT OUT.

730
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,934
- DON'T IT MAKE
YOUR RED STATE BLUE?

731
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,166
MILK!

732
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,333
- FROM TOGA PARTY TO COUTURE.

733
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,834
OH, DEAR.

734
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:22,767
NOW, I'VE HEARD
OF A MILK MOUSTACHE, BUT--

735
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,867
- HONEY.

736
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,200
- I AM SERVING
HERMAPHRODITE REALNESS.

737
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,367
I AM FEELING "XANADU,"
AND I AM WORKING IT OUT.

738
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,533
- VERY SISTER DIMENSION.

739
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,266
- OR FATHER TIME,
DEPENDING HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

740
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
- ♪ NOW SISSY THAT WALK ♪

741
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:39,800
COMING UP--

742
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,767
- IT WAS JUST A DISASTER.

743
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,967
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.

744
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,367
- YOU HAVE
TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU.

745
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,600
[LAUGHS]

746
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,567
- [LAUGHS]

747
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,567
WELCOME, PARTY GIRLS.

748
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,800
IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR FIRST CRITIQUE

749
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,166
FROM THE JUDGES.

750
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,567
FIRST UP,
TRINITY KARDASHIAN BONET.

751
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,367
- HONEY, YOU'RE GIVING ME
SOME KARDASHIAN ASS

752
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,333
IN THAT DRESS.

753
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,533
- OH.
- [LAUGHS]

754
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:07,367
- I THINK THAT
WOULD'VE BEEN FIERCE

755
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,500
WITHOUT THE BULLETIN BOARD
BEHIND YOUR NECK.

756
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,333
CAN YOU TAKE THAT OFF?
SEE?

757
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,433
LOOK HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAT LOOKS.

758
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,200
- GORGE.

759
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:20,133
- THANK YOU, TRINITY.
NEXT UP, BIANCA DEL RIO.

760
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,200
- THAT DRESS IS GORGEOUS.

761
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,333
- YOU DEFINITELY KNOW
HOW TO CONSTRUCT FOR THE BODY.

762
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:25,433
- NOW, DON'T STEAL THIS

763
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,767
AND TRY MARKETING THIS
AT SEARS, NOW, GIRL.

764
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,400
- OH, HONEY,
IT'S STOLEN, IT'S GONE.

765
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,867
I DO THINK THAT YOUR EYE MAKEUP
IS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY,

766
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,000
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I COULD SEE YOUR EYES

767
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,500
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO.

768
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,266
- IT'S JUST A SOFTENING
OF THE EDGES,

769
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,834
BUT THOSE DIMPLES
ARE EVERYTHING.

770
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,166
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD SEE MY ASS.

771
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,633
- [LAUGHTER]

772
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,367
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.

773
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
- NEXT UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, HELLO, DEAR.

774
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,200
- YOUR FACE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

775
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,600
THAT'S HOW YOU SOFTEN
THE EDGES, RIGHT THERE.

776
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,633
- IT LOOKS GORGEOUS.

777
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:56,200
- BUT THAT SAID,
A LITTLE BORING HERE.

778
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:58,467
- I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.

779
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,100
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE--

780
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,533
I'M A BIG GIRL.

781
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,066
I EMBRACE IT, THOUGH,
BUT I CANNOT HAVE RUCHING

782
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,300
IN FRONT OF MY BODY,

783
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,700
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING
TO ACCENTUATE MY PUSS.

784
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,433
I WISH YOUR OUTFIT WAS STRONGER.

785
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,533
- NEXT UP, MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.

786
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,533
- MY EYES HONED RIGHT IN
ON THAT NOSE CONTOUR,

787
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,266
IT IS SO DARK, GIRL.

788
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,867
- AND THAT DRESS,
IT'S VERY BASIC.

789
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,934
IT'S, LIKE, SO--

790
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,633
- I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS PRINT IS BASIC.

791
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,300
- BUT YOU THINK
THIS REPRESENTS YOU?

792
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:31,800
- YES, BECAUSE I AM ATTRACTED
TO THINGS THAT ARE SO UGLY

793
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,300
THEY'RE FABULOUS.

794
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,000
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THAT.

795
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,734
- I--
- THAT'S NOT UGLY.

796
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,667
- BUT I DIDN'T LIKE MY BOX.

797
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,200
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
WITH RED AND WHITE CHECK.

798
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,467
- THE THING IS,
YOU COULD'VE DONE MORE.

799
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,600
- I'VE GOT A GODDAMN BOW
ON MY ASS.

800
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:50,100
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.

801
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:51,800
- I--OKAY.

802
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:55,967
- THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING
OLYMPICS, GIRL.

803
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT
EVERY TIME.

804
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,767
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE
IN THIS BUSINESS,

805
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,767
YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE
TO LIKE YOU.

806
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,200
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON.

807
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,767
NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.

808
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,867
- HEY, JOSLYN.

809
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,800
- HELLO, YOU SEXY,
SEXY, BALD MAN.

810
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,000
- [LAUGHS]

811
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,033
THE WHOLE OUTFIT
IS JUST OVER THE TOP.

812
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,834
IT WAS LIKE A PARADE FLOAT.

813
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,500
- SHE DIDN'T WEAR ANYTHING
FROM HER BOX,

814
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,200
AND YOU WORE EVERY FRIGGIN'
THING IN YOUR BOX.

815
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:20,967
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

816
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,700
YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT.

817
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,567
CUT IT IN HALF.

818
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,400
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.

819
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,633
- G'DAY.

820
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,834
- YOU'RE GIVING ME
CHERYL TIEGS' "COSMO" COVER,

821
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,567
1976.

822
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,633
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE

823
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,633
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.

824
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,767
YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.

825
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,834
- I DID NOTICE
THAT YOU WERE TRIPPING UP

826
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:40,900
A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR SKIRT.

827
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:42,867
- IT'S JUST TOO LONG, I THINK.

828
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,400
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.

829
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:47,600
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.

830
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,767
- SO, MILK,

831
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,633
DO YOU THINK THIS IS
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO YOU ARE?

832
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:58,133
- YEAH. I HAVE A VERY QUIRKY
PERSONA AND STYLE.

833
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,333
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING
TO EVER FIT IN

834
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:05,300
WITH THOSE GLAMOROUS QUEENS,
AND SO, WHY NOT STAND OUT?

835
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,567
- YOU PROBABLY
COULD'VE LEFT OFF THE BEARD,

836
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,767
BECAUSE REALLY,
THE WHOLE ENSEMBLE

837
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,700
LOOKS LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS.

838
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,600
REALLY, IT'S LIKE
A FASHION ILLUSTRATION

839
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,767
JUST RIGHT OFF THE PAGE.

840
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,900
- YOU ARE OWNING EVERYTHING
OF WHO YOU ARE.

841
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,000
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE.

842
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,800
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

843
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,200
THANK YOU, LADIES.

844
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:28,333
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,

845
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:32,333
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

846
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,233
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
SQUIRREL FRIENDS,

847
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:39,734
LET'S START
WITH TRINITY KARDASHIAN BONET.

848
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,767
- I LOVE TRINITY'S CREATIVITY.

849
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,367
TRINITY BROUGHT
AN ENTIRE PERFORMANCE

850
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,500
TO THE RUNWAY.

851
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,233
- AFTER SHE TOOK THE PIZZA BOX
OFF FROM HER NECK,

852
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,266
I THOUGHT SHE WAS FIERCE.

853
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,033
- BIANCA DEL RIO.

854
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,734
LOVE THAT DRESS.
I WOULD WEAR THAT DRESS.

855
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,300
- I LOVED HER SENSE OF HUMOR.

856
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,033
SHE'S A QUEEN I'LL BE WATCHING.

857
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,734
- THE ONLY CRITIQUE
IS THE MAKEUP.

858
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:01,834
- YOU GOT TO BLEND.

859
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:02,900
- SISSY THAT FACE.

860
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,000
- YOU BETTER
SISSY THAT FACE, GIRL.

861
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:06,066
DARIENNE LAKE.

862
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,967
- SHE'S STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS.
- YEAH.

863
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,600
- BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WENT TO THE FANCY SECTION

864
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,700
AT DRESS BARN.

865
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,200
- UNFORGIVABLE IS THE RUCHING.

866
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:15,233
- THE COOCHIE RUCHING.
- OH, MY GOD.

867
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,367
THE PUFFY PUSS--
I CAN'T DEAL.

868
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,533
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.

869
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,934
- GIRL, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO WEAR COW PRINT,

870
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:25,400
YOU BETTER CAMP THE HELL
OUT OF THAT DRESS.

871
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,967
- SURE, WEAR A BELL
AROUND YOUR NECK.

872
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,367
IT'S INTERESTING
WATCHING MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD

873
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,500
GET SO DEFENSIVE.

874
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,633
I TOTALLY RELATE TO IT,
I'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF.

875
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,734
- I GET IRRITATED

876
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:36,000
WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE OR MY SISTERS.

877
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,066
- SURE.

878
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,567
- BUT I WANT TO BE
A BETTER VERSION OF ME.

879
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,900
THAT TAKES CONSTANT WORK.

880
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,300
- AND IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DEFENSIVE,

881
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,767
THEN IT DEFEATS THE POINT.

882
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,500
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MOVE ON TO JOSLYN FOX.

883
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,700
- I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
FORGIVE THAT OUTFIT,

884
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,066
THE MIDSECTION HAD NO SHAPE.

885
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,734
- I DON'T MIND THAT OUTFIT.

886
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,300
IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S COMING OUT HERE

887
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,133
IN A CAREER WOMAN,
AND, YOU KNOW--

888
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,333
- NO, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION
WAS JUST A DISASTER.

889
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,834
- COURTNEY ACT.

890
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,266
- THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON
TO THAT OUTFIT,

891
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,100
SO SHE DEFINITELY
WAS RELYING ON HER BODY,

892
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:07,066
WHICH, HEY,
IF YOU'VE GOT IT, RELY ON IT.

893
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,233
- YEAH.
- DO WHATEVER YOU CAN.

894
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:11,500
- BUT I JUST WOULD
EXPECT A LOT MORE FROM HER.

895
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:14,433
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
WHO WANTS MILK?

896
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,066
- HOPEFULLY,
MILK WILL BE ABLE

897
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,400
TO MAKE THE LOOK
MORE FEMININE WHEN WE ASK HER.

898
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,734
- WITH THAT SAID,

899
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,667
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BALLSY MOVE
TO COME OUT WITH A BEARD.

900
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,467
- I LIKE A BIG SET OF BALLS.

901
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,467
- YEAH, GIRL.
- YOU KNOW, HONEY, PLEASE.

902
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,400
- [LAUGHS]

903
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:30,867
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

904
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,266
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.

905
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,667
[LAUGHS]

906
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:40,667
- [LAUGHS]

907
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,433
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

908
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:44,333
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.

909
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:49,867
TRINITY K. BONET,

910
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,100
YOU'RE SAFE.

911
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,500
BIANCA DEL RIO,

912
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:58,200
YOUR COUTURE
WAS A REAL MAUI WOWIE.

913
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,033
CONDRAGULATIONS,

914
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:02,900
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.

915
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:03,834
[APPLAUSE]

916
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:06,900
YOU'VE WON A $2,500
SHOPPING SPREE

917
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:10,567
FROM FABRIC PLANET.

918
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,734
MILK, FOR NOT PLAYING IT SAFE,

919
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,200
YOU'RE SAFE.

920
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,367
COURTNEY ACT.

921
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,934
BODY, 10,

922
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,867
COUTURE, 6.

923
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,467
YOU'RE SAFE.

924
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,700
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,

925
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:35,033
YOUR BOVINE DESIGN
WAS NOT DIVINE.

926
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:38,033
WHERE'S THE BEEF?

927
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,900
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.

928
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,300
DARIENNE LAKE,

929
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,734
YOUR FACE IS PAINTED
FOR THE AGES,

930
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,333
BUT YOUR RUCHE LOOKED RUSHED.

931
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,100
JOSLYN FOX,

932
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,100
YOUR COUTURE REMINDS ME
OF A WEDDING--

933
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,467
SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING BORROWED,

934
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,734
SOMETHING BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW,

935
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,100
PINK, RED, CHARTREUSE.

936
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,400
- [LAUGHS]

937
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,767
- JOSLYN FOX, YOU'RE SAFE.

938
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,800
DARIENNE, MY DEAR,
I'M SORRY,

939
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,567
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.

940
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
- IT'S JUST ME AND MAGNOLIA.

941
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:24,400
- GIVE ME THE FIRING SQUAD,
I'M READY.

942
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,066
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.

943
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,166
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME

944
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,667
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.

945
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:39,066
THE TIME HAS COME

946
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,133
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC

947
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:44,100

985

YOU HIT A WALL,

986
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,600
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW FOR SURE--

987
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:35,767
YOU CAN'T KEEP A GOOD HO DOWN.

988
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,233
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.

989
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:40,900
- THANK YOU.

990
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:47,400
IT'S A SHAME THEY DIDN'T GET
TO LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE ME.

991
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:50,367
YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS
A LITTLE ABRASIVE.

992
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,834
THE THING IS, ALL PUBLICITY
IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

993
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:56,300

TAKE IT AND RUN WITH IT.

997
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,800
BECAUSE THERE ARE
6 MORE FIERCE QUEENS

998
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:13,767
READY TO SNATCH THE CROWN.

999
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
BITCHES BETTER BEWARE.

1000
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:30,567
- OH, FUCK.

1001
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,467
THE 6 OTHER BITCHES.

1002
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,900
- IT'S LIKE TWO PRIDES OF LIONS

1003
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,367
MEETING EACH OTHER
ON THE SERENGETI.

1004
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
- THIS IS LIKE "THE OUTSIDERS."

1005
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:41,367
I'M FROM AZUSA, OKAY?

1006
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,500
I KNOW HOW STREET FIGHTS
GET DOWN.

1007
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:46,300
- THEY'RE ALL TRYING
A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR MY TASTES,

1008
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,767
ESPECIALLY
THAT KIMORA LEE KARDASHIAN.

1009
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,166
I DON'T LIKE THEM.
DON'T LIKE THEM.

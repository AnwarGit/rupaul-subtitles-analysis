You are so fat, girl.

179
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,233
[laughter]

180
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,800
What are you doing here, mama?

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Go back to Chinatown, girl.

182
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,900
You are a<i> gringa, puerca.</i>

183
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,233
- Oh. Oh.

184
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,333
- You, the top model?

185
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,967
When I see your face,

186
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,500
I said [speaks Spanish].

187
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:54,433
- La biblioteca is closed.

188
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,700
All right, Jujubee.

189
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
- I'm not nervous.

190
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,266
I'll read a bitch.

191
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,867
I will read you to filth.

192
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:05,100
Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue cancelled?

193
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,233
Your grill is fucked up.

194
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,266
And, Miss Tatianna, Miss honey.

195
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,166
You think you're so soft.

196
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,333
Not by the hairs
of your chinny chin chin.

197
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,533
[laughter]

198
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,400
And let me tell you something,
<i>puerca.</i>

199
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
You won't understand this
anyways.

200
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,800
[speaking native language]

201
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,734
Get my gist?

202
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:30,166
Do ya understand?

203
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,300
Pandora...

204
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,100
Can we talk about sun tanning?

205
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,333
And you!

206
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,867
Legendary, you think you are.

207
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,066
Legendary?

208
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,500
Looks like leg and dairy.

209
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,066
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

210
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,200
The library is closed.

211
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Oh.

212
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,900
Okay.
Pandora Boxx.

213
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,934
- Tyra Sanchez,

214
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,900
if you are America's sweetheart,

215
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,967
America needs
a heart transplant.

216
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,467
Tatianna,

217
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:04,867
all I hear when I put my ear
up to yours is the ocean.

218
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,200
Jessica Wild.

219
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,066
Those drag clothes look like
a donkey funked a piñata

220
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,700
and threw up.

221
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,967
Jujubee,

222
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,266
with that gaping thing
you call an asshole,

223
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,900
I think I could go spelunking
in there.

224
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,767
- [gasps]
Spelunking.

225
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,867
- Raven, the frosty bitch.

226
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,800
I think I see penguins
circling that pole.

227
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,934
- The library is closed.

228
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:34,100
Ready for the flavor
of the Raven?

229
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,300
- You got a grill that could
put Black &amp; Decker

230
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,266
out of business.

231
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,600
- Ooh!

232
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,333
- Everyone thinks you're pretty.

233
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,800
I do think you're pretty.

234
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,967
I think you have
a beautiful face...

235
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,066
for radio.

236
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,934
- Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.

237
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,200
- You want to call me
a top model,<i> mami?</i>

238
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,500
Bend over and take it
like a man.

239
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,900
I'll be your top...
model.

240
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
- Oh, that's cold.

241
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,233
That's cold.

242
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:01,200
- Honey,
don't you know a thing about

243
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
doing a manicure
and a pedicure?

244
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,100
Fix them hooves, honey.

245
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,367
Pandora,
by the looks of you,

246
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,133
you're going through the change
of life, honey.

247
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,800
- Oh, oh, oh.

248
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,133
She done closed the libraries.

249
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,233
Ooh, child.

250
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,767
I need to duck and cover,

251
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:21,133
'cause y'all bitches is throwing
beaucoup shade.

252
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,734
But the winner is...

253
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,300
Jujubee.

254
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,266
- I win! Finally!

255
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,400
- Congratulations, miss thing.

256
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,867
Now, I wanted to take
this moment

257
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,433
to introduce you to
Absolut image czar

258
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,400
Jeffrey Moran.

259
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,433
- Hey, ladies. How are you?

260
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,700
- Hi.

261
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,633
- To be the best,
you have to be daring enough

262
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,300
to do things
a little differently,

263
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,667
and we've done that recently
with a brand-new flavor

264
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,233
that we're gonna debut here--
Berri Acai.

265
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:56,066
And what we want from you today
is just that.

266
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,700
We want you to be
a little different,

267
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,066
a little exceptional,

268
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,333
because just like you,

269
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,500
we believe that in
an Absolut world,

270
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
every cocktail is
an exceptional experience.

271
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,834
- Now, ladies,

272
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:09,333
"exceptional"
is the word of the week.

273
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,600
Now, I've had the chance
to write two books

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,700
about my own
exceptional life experiences,

275
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,433
including my recent book,
<i>Working It:</i>

276
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,033
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>
<i>Liberty,</i>

277
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,533
<i>and The Pursuit of Style.</i>

278
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,500
Writing a book is a great way

279
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,266
to let people know
who you really are.

280
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,533
For this week's main challenge,

281
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,433
you need to come up with
your own book,

282
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,033
an autobiography,

283
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:35,066
that highlights
the most exceptional moments

284
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,233
in your life.

285
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,934
They should shed light on
who you really are.

286
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,100
Now, later on,

287
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
you'll be working with
a team of photographers,

288
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,867
Idris and Tony, to create
the perfect book cover.

289
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:49,500
And I'll be back a little later

290
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,166
to check on your progress.

291
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,867
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

292
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:58,800
And may the best woman win.

293
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,333
- Jujubee.

294
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,767
- This is my creative
inspiration, okay?

295
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,834
- That's your thinking cap?

296
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:17,567
- It's my--
it's my thinking hat.

297
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,633
- Our main challenge today
is to come up with a concept

298
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,300
of what our book would be

299
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,166
and then design the cover
for the book.

300
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,066
- This challenge is so different
from all the other challenges,

301
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:33,400
because it's about us letting
people know who we are.

302
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,133
- I dedicate my book to Beyoncé.

303
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,367
- [laughs]

304
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,867
- This might be the turning
point for some people.

305
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,066
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.

306
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:52,400
- How's your autobiography,
Miss Jane Pittman?

307
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,467
Do you have a title
for your book?

308
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,633
-<i> The Woman in Me.</i>

309
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,834
- Is this funny? Serious?

310
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,100
- It's more serious.

311
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,967
It's, like, how the woman,
which is Tyra,

312
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,767
helped me, like, get back to
loving people

313
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,133
and understanding people and
allowing people to love me back.

314
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,400
As a teenager,
I made mistakes.

315
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,934
I was out on the streets.

316
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,467
I had a son on the way.

317
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,834
So it was, like,
a little scary.

318
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,467
And to express it and put it out
has been a little challenging.

319
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,633
- Now, the cover of your book,
any ideas?

320
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,633
- I don't have any yet.

321
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,767
- If you want to be
behind this book,

322
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,500
you have to own it here.

323
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,934
Any questions?

324
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:30,367
- Nope. None.
- Okay.

325
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,834
Hey, Miss Raven.
- Hello.

326
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,934
- Do you have a title
for your book?

327
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,367
-<i> Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>

328
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,467
- [gasps]
I love it.

329
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,533
- My favorite chapter is LTR--

330
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,266
long-term relationship.

331
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,900
The long-term relationship
I found

332
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,066
is the relationship with myself.

333
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,734
- Ooh, you're getting close
to home here.

334
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:46,867
- Yes, girl.

335
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,333
- Well, I would just advise you
to strategize

336
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,200
who you see buying this book.

337
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,233
[both speaking Spanish]

338
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,266
Now, what's your book about?

339
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,166
- A kid.

340
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,700
He always have dreams,
daydreams,

341
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,533
and at the end,
all those dreams

342
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,066
he make come true.

343
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,700
- Well, you know,
there are a lot of dreamers.

344
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,734
I just want to make sure
that the people know

345
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:18,633
that this book is about
Jessica Wild.

346
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,800
And a gorgeous picture
on the cover.

347
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,900
A title that's kind of funny
to say or cheeky.

348
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
So think about those things,
okay?

349
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,533
- All right.
All right.

350
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:31,066
I'm very worry
about my own thing.

351
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,567
I'm thinking in Spanish and
writing in English,

352
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,066
and I don't have a lot of time
for work on this.

353
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,300
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello.

354
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,433
- Tell me the title
of your book.

355
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,834
- It's called<i> Tati:</i>

356
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,467
<i>From Teen Queen</i>
<i>to Drag Superstar.</i>

357
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,533
- Sounds salacious.

358
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:52,266
- It's about my life
prior to becoming Tatianna.

359
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,300
I started doing drag
when I was 14.

360
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,600
I came out in fifth grade.

361
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,867
- Well, it's a great story.

362
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,867
And a lot of people need to hear
that story.

363
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:02,166
How are you gonna convey that
on your book cover?

364
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:07,066
- I just want me on,
like, a big, huge stage.

365
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,533
I absolutely think people can
learn something from my story.

366
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:12,934
And I might have a little bit
more experience

367
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,700
than other people
give me credit for.

368
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,367
- All right,
so get back to your makeup,

369
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,166
and make a real pretty cover.

370
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,467
- All right.
- All right.

371
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,467
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

372
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:23,133
Hey, Pandora.
- Hey.

373
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,700
- So what's the title
of your book?

374
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,233
-<i> Out of the Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.

375
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,667
- It's about discovering myself

376
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,100
through dressing up
like somebody else.

377
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,300
- Mm.

378
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,533
- And really kind of finding
your inner strength,

379
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,967
and not listening to that voice

380
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,400
that says
you're not good enough.

381
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,467
There's a couple times that
I had tried to kill myself.

382
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,533
- Oh, honey.

383
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,900
Was there a turning point?

384
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,800
- Through theater
and discovering that,

385
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,433
I kind of felt people
that were like me,

386
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,767
and that's when
I discovered drag,

387
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,200
and I started to come out
of my shell

388
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,367
and be more open
and like myself more.

389
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,834
- So you can honestly say,
"drag saved my life."

390
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,900
- Yes.

391
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,734
- I always think of you
as the funny one,

392
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,166
the Goldie Hawn of the group,

393
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,767
and now it's--
it's interesting.

394
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,500
You tell me the story of
your dark night of the soul.

395
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,100
It adds depth to your character.

396
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,367
- I think that with a
lot of people that are funny

397
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,633
and a lot of comedians, there is
some darkness that's there,

398
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,367
because that's what they use to
combat that, was their humor...

399
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:16,266
- Sure.
- And their laughter.

400
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,867
- It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

401
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,667
I've read all your books.

402
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,834
[both laughing]

403
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,233
What's the title we have there?

404
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,800
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>

405
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,133
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>

406
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:32,233
-<i> Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>

407
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:36,266
- My target audience
for my book is gay Asians.

408
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,066
When you're a gay Asian male,

409
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,433
they don't see you as that.

410
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:42,734
They see you as a woman who
was born into the wrong body.

411
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,900
That's definitely not me.

412
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,066
It basically starts out
with my childhood,

413
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,133
the discovery
of my homosexuality.

414
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,433
- Wait a minute. Hold up.
- I know, right?

415
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,066
- Your homosexuality?
- I know, girl.

416
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:56,066
And then I touch on, you know,
like, the loss of my father,

417
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,700
and then my move across America.

418
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,233
- How do you say "fierce"
in Laotian?

419
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,734
- I would just say Juju.
- Juju.

420
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,533
[laughter]

421
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,467
- Juju, huh?

422
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,166
- All right, ladies.

423
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,967
For your main challenge,

424
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,467
in addition to
your book cover photo shoot,

425
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,367
you'll be doing an interview

426
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,867
with celebrity journalist
Marc Malkin.

427
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,433
This is a really great time for
you to show off your charisma,

428
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,166
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.

429
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,066
You'll also be judged
on your ability

430
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:30,734
to seamlessly work in plugs
for your upcoming book,

431
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,734
as well as

432
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:36,300
the Berri Acai Absolut cocktail.

433
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,166
The more you can plug your book

434
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:42,066
and the Berri Acai,
the better.

435
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,700
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,

436
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,266
our special guest judges will be
two best- selling authors--

437
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:52,066
Gigi Levangie Grazer...

438
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:56,500
and the one and only
Jackie Collins.

439
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,900
Lucky, lucky, lucky bitches.

440
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,066
- Jackie Collins.

441
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,600
Are you serious?

442
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,533
She embodies what a diva is.

443
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,266
- And to quote
one of my favorite authors...

444
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:12,233
Don't fuck it up.

445
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,867
- The main challenge today
is to take photos

446
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,467
for the cover
of our autobiography

447
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:19,066
and do an interview.

448
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,500
- How you doing?
I'm Idris.

449
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,066
- Tyra.
- Nice to meet you.

450
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,900
- Tony.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

451
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,200
- What would you like to do
today?

452
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,433
- Well, the title of my book
is<i> The Woman in Me.</i>

453
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,433
- They're in charge.

454
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,467
They're supposed to direct us

455
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,667
and tell us their vision.

456
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,100
- It's not just about a dress,
you know,

457
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
or how the girl looks.

458
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,333
they've got to commit
to their concept.

459
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,567
- The concept is three pictures
of me--

460
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,934
me holding on to the past,

461
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,433
accepting the present,

462
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:48,100
and looking towards the future.

463
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,333
I don't know how the other girls
are at photos,

464
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,367
but I'm very photogenic.

465
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,567
- You're melting
under these lights.

466
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,567
- It was burning hot.

467
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,300
All my makeup
started sweating off.

468
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,633
I was like, "Oh, shit."

469
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,667
-<i> 30 seconds.</i>

470
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,066
- Tyra's just--
she was melting.

471
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,633
If she were doing a workout book
where you had to be sweaty,

472
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,100
then, yeah,
it would be great.

473
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
- I was thinking of taking
the chest that's over there...

474
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,867
- Okay.

475
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,967
- And having me
coming out of it.

476
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,066
- All right.
So let's get the stuff.

477
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:16,266
- I want my book cover
to be funny,

478
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:20,767
and my concept is to have myself
coming out of a box.

479
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,767
Lust over me, bitches.

480
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:25,700
<i>- Okay.</i>

481
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,767
- All right,
so what are we doing?

482
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:27,767
- One here, one here.

483
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,867
- Just think about your time.

484
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,333
- If you guys want to,
like, face away,

485
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,066
and then just kind of glancing
over at me like, "Damn."

486
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,066
- Okay.

487
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,967
- Now, how do you want them
looking at you,

488
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,433
'cause right now they're kind of
looking at you

489
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,667
like you're crazy.

490
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,333
- No, like you want me.

491
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,633
[laughter]

492
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,233
I can't look at the pit crew
and direct them,

493
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,633
because I'm supposed to be
looking at the camera.

494
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,133
And they weren't
very cooperative.

495
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:56,233
So finally I was just, like,
"Get the hell away from me."

496
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,300
- Hello.

497
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,100
- Okay, I want to be sitting
at a yard sale,

498
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,500
and I want to sit
in that pink chair.

499
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
I knew my idea
for my book cover.

500
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,834
I'm at a yard sale.

501
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,667
I've got to find the shit
and get it together.

502
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,700
I want the award,
the radio,

503
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,233
the bust, and then this phone
right here.

504
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

505
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,767
- What's the idea
for the book cover?

506
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,367
- I just want to look good.

507
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,734
- Whatever you want.

508
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,400
- Let's try to work
this shit out.

509
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,100
- Okay.

510
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,800
- That's mannish, isn't it?

511
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,867
- You look a little wide.

512
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:29,333
- Ooh.

513
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,066
- Jujubee could have used her
time more wisely.

514
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,066
She had extra minutes.

515
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,200
- You know, she came
out with one prop,

516
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,266
a fan in her hand,
and half the time,

517
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,333
that fan was on the floor.

518
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,066
What are you thinking about
right now?

519
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,600
- About my dreams.

520
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,133
- It kind of looks like you're
just standing there staring off,

521
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,800
so you really have to think
about all of your dreams

522
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
and let that come out.

523
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,066
[camera shutter clicking]

524
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,834
Honey, why don't you think about
something else,

525
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:00,867
'cause it looks a little...

526
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,867
- All right.

527
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,333
Oh, my God.

528
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,500
I love doing things perfect.

529
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,333
And I think I lost things

530
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,967
from my hands,
you know?

531
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,600
- What were your other ideas?
- What?

532
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,333
- You wanted to use
some other props?

533
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,200
- She kind of came in defeated.

534
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,533
- And if you come in defeated,
then you are defeated.

535
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:31,066
Think about something that would
pertain to your dreams.

536
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,867
- Can I take it?
- Yeah, of course.

537
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:35,367
You can take anything you want
from here.

538
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,200
- Nice. There you go.
Believe in it.

539
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,233
- I believe.

540
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,567
- What is this?

541
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,834
This thing is caught
onto my dress,

542
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,500
and I can't take my dress off.

543
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,567
They have to stop my time.

544
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,667
Immediately after photo shoot,

545
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,734
you have less than five minutes
to change

546
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:55,934
and get to the interview.

547
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,200
Jessica.
- What?

548
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,333
- Is it okay if I put on your
corset really quick?

549
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,367
- Yeah.

550
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,367
- Now I have more pressure.

551
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,166
Now I have a bigger challenge

552
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,734
to know that I only have
such and such amount of time,

553
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:09,066
and I need to get this done.

554
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,367
- There was a lot that went into
this challenge.

555
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,567
Tatianna didn't change
her costume at all.

556
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,066
She went straight from her
photo shoot to her interview.

557
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,300
I didn't really see an effort
in that.

558
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,133
- We need to talk about the book
or about drag life?

559
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,233
- The book and the alcohol
is the main focus.

560
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,066
The two really important things
during the interview

561
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,533
is that we have to pitch
the book

562
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,867
and the Berri Acai
Absolut vodka.

563
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,133
- How do you say
that berry drink?

564
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,133
"Acia"?

565
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,834
Berri Ac--

566
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,433
- It's acai.

567
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,700
- Acai.
- Acai.

568
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,667
- Acai.

569
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,934
- Acai?
A-ca-I.

570
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,200
- Guys, is it "Berri Acai,"
or "acai berry"?

571
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,767
- We're going to have
an interview

572
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,633
with celebrity reporter
Marc Malkin,

573
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,066
and as I sit down in the seat

574
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,767
and there's just a camera
in front of me

575
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,200
and they start to put
the earpiece in,

576
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,867
I realize
this is a satellite interview.

577
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,600
He's not going to be here.

578
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,633
- Oh, my god.

579
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:00,834
There's nobody here?

580
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:01,834
And he can see me.

581
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,066
But I can't see him.

582
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,333
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.

583
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,934
Where's the guy at?
- What's going on?

584
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,367
- Is this via satellite?
- It is satellite.

585
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,834
Why should you win<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

586
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,400
- Well, first of all, I'm young,
broke, and fabulous.

587
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,633
My new book
is going to hit stores soon.

588
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,934
- What's this new book?

589
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,233
- It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>

590
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,734
- I have the full package.

591
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:21,700
I have personality,
I have sense of style,

592
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,066
and I have great, big,
white teeth.

593
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,734
- Why are you better
than the other girls?

594
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:30,066
- I'm better because I'm
Jessica Wild, and I'm unique.

595
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,066
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--

596
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:35,900
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.
Oh, my God.

597
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,500
- So how many times have
straight men hit on you?

598
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
- Every time I've gone out
in drag,

599
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,266
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy.

600
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:42,834
Sometimes I'll be like,
"Back it up.

601
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,266
I'm a dude."

602
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:45,600
If they're just
giving a compliment,

603
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,734
I just say, "Thank you."

604
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,567
So I must be doing something
right.

605
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,333
- It's so exciting to be a part
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

606
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,800
It's almost as exciting as
my new book,<i> Out of the Boxx.</i>

607
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,166
- The book is called
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>

608
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,400
I know how to love,
know how to give, and celebrate,

609
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,433
like I am with this berry
...drink from Absolut.

610
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,834
- I just got finished
writing a memoir,

611
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,367
and I call it<i> </i>
<i>Memoirs of a Gay-sha.</i>

612
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,734
- Where do you hide your candy?

613
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,867
- There's a lot of candy going
on down here.

614
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,800
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.

615
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,667
- Every once in a while,
I'll have a cocktail.

616
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,600
My drink of choice
is the Berri Acai from Absolut.

617
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,500
- Do you always drink
when you're doing media?

618
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,233
- No, it's my first time,
but I love that drink.

619
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:26,567
- What kind of vodka is it?
- Berri Acai vodka.

620
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,900
- Berry Absolut.
- Berri Acai.

621
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,266
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.

622
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:31,367
- Thank you.

623
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,867
And let me tell you
about this beverage.

624
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,233
- Oh, good luck. Got to go.

625
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:36,300
- The only thing
I might have screwed up on

626
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,633
is not mentioning the book.

627
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:41,266
But everything else, I felt like
I was--I was on point.

628
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,867
- Jessica,
thanks for being here.

629
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:45,500
- Thanks,
and I have my new book.

630
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,467
- What was that?

631
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,700
- The name is<i> Jessica Wild:</i>

632
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,066
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>

633
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,066
- Fantastic.

634
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,867
Thanks, Jessica.
Good luck.

635
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,867
- I love that drink.

636
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,633
- Hola, hola.

637
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,433
- How your hooves be, Juju?

638
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,233
- How's the leg and dairy?

639
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,667
- Yesterday we had to read
each other.

640
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,767
I actually like
all of the queens that are here,

641
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,967
and to read them,

642
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,266
you kind of have to
make fun of them.

643
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:17,900
- I'm sure everyone's
had a little inkling

644
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,867
of their feelings hurt.

645
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,133
If anyone was offended,

646
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,734
I'm sorry
that I spoke the truth.

647
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,066
- I wasn't offended.

648
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:27,266
If you can't laugh at yourself,
then go home.

649
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,700
- It's hard to talk shit
about flawlessness.

650
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,133
[laughs]

651
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,400
- Since Morgan's been gone,
Raven all of a sudden decides

652
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,333
that she wants to blossom
verbally.

653
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,834
- Tatianna, did you just
not want to do it?

654
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,667
- No, I just couldn't
stop laughing.

655
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,266
These sparkling 30 years
that she's got behind her,

656
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:46,333
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.

657
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,567
She's just got to spread it.

658
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:51,300
- Like, Tatianna froze
and didn't read anyone really.

659
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,467
Do you think they're gonna
look at her and be like,

660
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,667
"What's going on, girl?"

661
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,500
- Raven might have been trying
to rattle my cage.

662
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,300
I think that she's been hoping
that I go from day one.

663
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,900
I did well.
I didn't drop my book.

664
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,967
I got the drink in.

665
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,834
I just completely forgot
about the book.

666
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,800
-<i> Tatianna's an airhead.</i>

667
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,567
She should have been in
the bottom two last week.

668
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:14,400
All she's been doing
the past couple weeks is this.

669
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,066
Just my opinion.
- Thank you.

676

- Hey, Ru.
- Hey.

677
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,700
- Santino, how are you tonight?

678
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,133
- We're gonna have a great show.

679
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,600
- We are.

680
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,767
- Now, Merle,

681
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,333
are you ready to hear from
our budding authors?

682
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,800
- I'm very, very excited.
- Gigi.

683
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,533
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, darling.

684
00:25:56,533 --> 00:26:00,533
Now, your most recent novel,
<i>Queen Takes King,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

685
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:02,767
maybe after tonight
you can write a sequel.

686
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:03,967
-<i> Queen Takes Queen?</i>

687
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,066
- Yeah.
- Okay. Co-write it.

688
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,333
- Done. Done and done.

689
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,100
And my buddy Jackie Collins
is here.

690
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,734
Hi, darling.
- Hi, darling.

691
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:16,700
- I love the title
of your new book,<i> </i>

692
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,200
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl.</i>

693
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
That's great!

694
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,967
- I should have dedicated it
to you.

695
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,367
- You should have.

696
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:26,767
And Absolut's image czar,

697
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,333
the exceptional
Jeffrey Moran.

698
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,166
- Hello, darling.
- All right.

699
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,166
Inspired by my new book,

700
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,300
<i>Working It:</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>

701
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,934
<i>Liberty, and the Pursuit</i>
<i>of Style,</i>

702
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:41,266
this week,
the ladies were challenged

703
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,100
to pitch us their autobiography,

704
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,834
design a book cover,

705
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:49,066
and field questions
from an entertainment reporter.

706
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,467
Tonight they're dressed
to the nines

707
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,333
for their book launch party.

708
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,834
Judges, are you ready
to take a look?

709
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:57,100
- Ready.
- Ready.

710
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,166
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.

711
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,400
And may the best woman win.

712
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:09,500
Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.

713
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,900
<i>- The dress that I chose</i>
<i>is very skin-tight.</i>

714
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,967
<i>You can actually see the shape</i>
<i>of my body.</i>

715
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,967
- Is Jennifer Lopez 
missing something?

716
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,333
- She is missing something,
and she'll never get it back.

717
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,734
[laughter]

718
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,367
<i>- I know the judges</i>
<i>look forward to me</i>

719
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,066
transforming my look.

720
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,734
- Oh, yes.

721
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:28,233
Style proper, Sanchez.

722
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,300
[cheers and applause]

723
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Oh!

724
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,567
- No, she didn't.

725
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,266
- Poor little bitch girl.

726
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,266
- I'm glad my boyfriend's
not here.

727
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:37,667
I would have just lost him
on that one.

728
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,133
[laughter]

729
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,867
- Jujubee.

730
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,533
Now, Gigi,
is this a starter wife?

731
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,367
- That's the finisher wife.

732
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,567
<i>I don't think anyone</i>
<i>would ever leave that.</i>

733
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:50,200
<i>- I always make eye contact</i>
with every single judge.

734
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,867
It's, like, the complete
opposite of shade.

735
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,333
It's the "hey, hey, hey" look.

736
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,633
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

737
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,100
<i>Tatianna.</i>

738
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,667
Ooh, it's a jailbreak.

739
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,066
- [gasps]

740
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:02,133
<i>You know, they say never wear</i>
<i>horizontal stripes</i>

741
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,233
<i>unless you're Tatianna.</i>

742
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,967
<i>- I'm not really super</i>
glammed-out

743
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,166
<i>like the other girls,</i>

744
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:09,734
<i>but I'm thinking</i>
<i>I look really good.</i>

745
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,800
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i>

746
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,600
<i>[gasps]</i>
<i>Oh, darling, yes.</i>

747
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
She's full of surprises.

748
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>

749
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,834
<i>and I'm thinking glamour.</i>
<i>but, you know,</i>

750
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,333
<i>there's still that element</i>
<i>of fun.</i>

751
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,266
- If Courtney Love looked
like a woman...

752
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,667
- Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

753
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,734
[laughter]

754
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,767
-<i> Jessica Wild.</i>

755
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:31,066
-<i> Now, she looks like a heroine</i>
<i>from one of my books.</i>

756
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,967
- Which one, Jackie?
- Lucky Santangelo.

757
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:35,133
-<i> Jessica Santangelo.</i>

758
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,900
-<i> Today is my party.</i>

759
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,066
<i>I love that dress.</i>

760
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,333
- Jessica Wild
from Puerto Rico.

761
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,333
<i>Raven.</i>

762
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,700
Oh, darling.

763
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,166
<i>That's so not Raven.</i>

764
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,367
[laughter]

765
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,934
<i>- I decided to go with</i>
something

766
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:52,500
<i>a little more super glam.</i>

767
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,800
<i>I feel like I should be</i>
<i>in Greek mythology,</i>

768
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,967
<i>and they should write a story</i>
<i>about me.</i>

769
00:28:56,967 --> 00:29:00,500
<i>- A star is born again.</i>

770
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,200
- She has a politician lover
on the side.

771
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,667
-<i> Disco scandalous.</i>

772
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,066
Hello, ladies.

773
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,133
My<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>

774
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,467
<i>Tyra Sanchez,</i>

775
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:14,066
let's take a look
at your book cover.

776
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,300
Oh, okay.

777
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
What's it about?
- My past.

778
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,700
How I held on to it for so long

779
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,633
and held grudges against people.

780
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,266
I was a very, very mean,
arrogant bitch, that--

781
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:27,133
- And the problem
with that is...?

782
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:30,600
Let's take a look
at your satellite interview,

783
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,967
where we asked you to promote
not only your book and yourself,

784
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:38,100
but also the Absolut
Berri Acai cocktail.

785
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,700
- I know how to love,
I know how to give,

786
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,233
and celebrate,
like I am with this berry...

787
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,600
drink from Absolut.

788
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,266
- You didn't incorporate
the "acai" part of it.

789
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,500
- I'd rather not fuck up
the last ending of the name.

790
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,233
- If you're gonna be paid
by a corporation,

791
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,066
you should probably figure out
how to say the name.

792
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:55,967
- I'm not thrilled
with the cover of the book.

793
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:59,567
- I felt it was a little busy.
but I love the concept.

794
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,734
I was very happy to see that
you took it so seriously.

795
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:06,300
- Jujubee, let's take a look
at your book cover.

796
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,500
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>

797
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,934
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>I'm Still Here.</i>

798
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:10,934
[laughter]

799
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,967
I just want to show people

800
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,567
that you can go through things,

801
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,934
take that negative energy,
turn it around,

802
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:17,133
and use it to live.

803
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,367
It's a lesson.

804
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:21,166
- Love the title.
I'm very big on titles.

805
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,467
My new book is called
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> so...</i>

806
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,700
But that is a great title,

807
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,433
and I think you'll attract
not only a gay audience

808
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,233
with that title,
but with a straight audience

809
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,433
who's interested in reading
about your life's experiences,

810
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,400
especially coming from
an Asian family.

811
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,900
- It reminds us
of a great book already,

812
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,133
so that was very clever
thinking.

813
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,300
- There's a lot of candy
going on down here.

814
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,066
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.

815
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:47,800
- By the way, I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls

816
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,767
who would like to, uh,
take you out, if you ever--

817
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,333
if you're ever available.

818
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:58,633
- Tatianna, you're giving this
not jailbreak,

819
00:30:58,633 --> 00:30:59,700
but jailbait look.

820
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,867
Let's take a look
at your book cover.

821
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,800
- Ooh.
- Superstar.

822
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,700
- My book is about
becoming a drag queen at 14,

823
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,367
dealing with the backlash
from that,

824
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,500
but still going forward
and not letting anyone stop me.

825
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,300
- Now, where was that person
when you walked down the runway?

826
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm a little worried about
your confidence level.

827
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:22,467
- This dress, it could be
three stripes shorter.

828
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,700
- Shorter.
- Yeah.

829
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
- Okay.

830
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,300
I'm giving up
on trying to figure out

831
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,834
what's short enough
and what's long enough,

832
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,133
because...

833
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,066
- It's just slightly too long,

834
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,433
and it's starting to kind of

835
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,333
give a more
Morticia Addams look to it.

836
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,233
- Straight men love
to hit on me.

837
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,300
Every time I've gone out
in drag,

838
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,633
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy,

839
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,300
so I must be doing
something right.

840
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,667
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.

841
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:45,734
- Thank you.

842
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:47,633
And let me tell you
about this beverage.

843
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:48,800
- Unfortunately,

844
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,567
you did not mention
the name of the book.

845
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:52,934
Maybe it's fortunate,
because I'm not crazy about

846
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,767
the title of the book,
<i>Tati.</i>

847
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:58,066
Because Tati, I mean,
can be T-A-T-T-Y.

848
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:01,066
That's an English word
that means kind of not great.

849
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,433
- If that's the way
you squeeze in the cocktail,

850
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:05,066
we might have had a fight
in the car

851
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,934
on the way
to the next interview.

852
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:08,066
- Thanks, Tatianna.

853
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,300
- Thank you.

854
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,367
- Hello, Pandora.

855
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,433
- Hello, RuPaul.
- Oh, boy.

856
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,934
You got to use the pit crew.

857
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,567
- My book is about
how drag taught me

858
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,834
to gain self-confidence.

859
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,900
- Pandora, if you're wearing
this to be glamorous,

860
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,400
it's not working for me.

861
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,567
- This fabric is playing
with glamour,

862
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,500
but playing with, like,
funny glamour.

863
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,533
- If you're gonna look like
a coke whore,

864
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,900
take the joke even further.

865
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,333
- What kind of vodka is it?

866
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,900
- It's Berri Acai vodka.

867
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,133
- Missing my brand,
that was tough for me.

868
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:41,066
- Pandora Boxx, what do you
have to say for yourself?

869
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,867
- I just want to say that
my book,<i> </i>

870
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,834
<i>Out of the Boxx:</i>
<i>How Drag Saved My Life,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

871
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,533
is now available online
and in stores.

872
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,900
[laughter]

873
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,166
- Jessica Wild,
can we see your book?

874
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,934
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

875
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,233
- The cover looks like
the cover of a book,

876
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,867
like, a nine-year-old girl
would buy.

877
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,066
It could be a little more
sophisticated.

878
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:01,467
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--

879
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,066
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.

880
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,133
Oh, my God.

881
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:09,834
The name is<i> Jessica wild...</i>

882
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:14,600
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>

883
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,567
- Your interview got into,
like, train-wreck territory.

884
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,967
- On there, it sounded like
"dreams of a golden shower."

885
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:22,967
Do you know what that is?
- No.

886
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,934
- If you don't know
what a golden shower is,

887
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:25,967
that's very naive.

888
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,500
[laughter]

889
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,433
However, I like the cover.

890
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,133
It's a little pretentious to
have an Oscar on the front of it

891
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,433
because-- [laughs]
Who knows?

892
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:36,767
- I'm not crazy about the cover

893
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,100
I feel like you could use

894
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,967
some of that Jessica Wild
imagination,

895
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,934
make a bigger splash
with that cover.

896
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:44,800
The interview
was basically so bad

897
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,233
that I wouldn't change a thing.

898
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,133
[laughter]

899
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,667
- Now, Jeffrey, you got your
product in there a lot.

900
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:51,633
- Yeah.

901
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,133
It was a little too sloppy.

902
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,100
I would probably have fired you
in the car

903
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,700
on the way home
from that interview.

904
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,300
- Raven, darling,
I love your fro.

905
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,166
- It was straight earlier,
but it's so humid back there.

906
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,934
[laughter]

907
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,467
- Let's see your book.

908
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,066
Oh.

909
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:10,100
- I've come from so many
broken things--

910
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,367
broken family, broken home,
broken relationships.

911
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:16,433
This is showing how to find
your inner strength.

912
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,533
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

913
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:22,066
- Well, first of all,
I'm young, broke, and fabulous.

914
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:25,867
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>

915
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:28,734
- Well, I am extremely
impressed.

916
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,934
Do you know how many times
you said the title?

917
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,667
Even I have trouble--

918
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,433
I do do it sometimes,
but that was really great.

919
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,967
And you did it with style.

920
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,066
You bought it right in right at
the beginning of the interview.

921
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,066
I loved that.

922
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,533
Good for you.

923
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:43,600
- You're so sultry.

924
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,734
I feel like you could teach me

925
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,066
how to be more of a woman.

926
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,700
- I think you could teach me
how to be more of a woman.

927
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,767
- I don't think s--
[laughs]

928
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,367
- I'm a man in a dress.

929
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:54,967
[laughter]

930
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,934
- Thank you, ladies.

931
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:59,066
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

932
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,300
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

933
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,166
the judges and I
will deliberate.

934
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,133
[engine turns]

935
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,834
Let's start with Tyra Sanchez.

936
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,533
- I like the title of her book.

937
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:09,867
[deep voice]<i> </i>
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>

938
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:11,100
[laughter]

939
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,867
- One of the best dresses
we've seen this season.

940
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:17,066
And I like the book, and I like
that she revealed a little bit,

941
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:19,967
'cause we don't see a lot
of vulnerability in her.

942
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,200
- Uh, Jujubee.

943
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,867
- I thought she was dynamite.

944
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,700
He had a fantastic personality.

945
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,533
She came across as really alive
and bright--

946
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,800
very, very bright.

947
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
I liked her a lot.

948
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,333
- I think she probably crossed
over the good-taste line,

949
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,700
but we could have probably
lived with that.

950
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
- Tatianna.

951
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,734
- It did look like
she was part of a chain gang.

952
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm sorry, I couldn't get over
the dress.

953
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,166
It just went on and on and on

954
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,667
and I thought it was hideous.

955
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,333
It looked like Olive Oyl.

956
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,367
- I didn't get--
pick up any confidence

957
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:47,700
from her whatsoever.

958
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,633
- Pandora Boxx.

959
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:50,433
You know,
she's been consistent

960
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:54,367
in her ability
to just be a real player.

961
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,600
But she doesn't take it
to that next level.

962
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,667
- She looks like a girl

963
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,433
that's just stepped off
the Greyhound bus

964
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,367
and quickly
turned into a coke whore.

965
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,967
- That sounds like a book
I'd read...

966
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,533
[laughter]
And Jackie's written it.

967
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,734
- Yes.
Yes, I've written it.

968
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:07,867
- Jessica Wild.

969
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,700
- Title of her book
wasn't right.

970
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,066
- I mean, she was hilarious,

971
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,867
but not on purpose.

972
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,333
But this is kind of
a serious thing

973
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,734
and it's like, you really have
to step up to the plate

974
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:18,734
or the dance floor,
as it were.

975
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:19,700
- This is branding.

976
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,300
Clearly,
Jessica did not understand

977
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,133
the intricacies of that.

978
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,100
Raven.

979
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,633
- She showed this great
personality.

980
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,567
and, uh, the hair was fantastic,

981
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:31,266
the dress, the book--
<i>Young, Broke and Fabulous.</i>

982
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:33,333
Not young, not broke,
but fabulous.

983
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,567
[laughter]

984
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,934
- There's a lack of
vulnerability, though, in--

985
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,233
in Raven.

986
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,333
- And there is such a thing
as overselling, you know?

987
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,300
She needs to practice
some restraint.

988
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,433
- All right, then.

989
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,467
Silence.

990
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:48,066
Bring back the girls.

991
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,567
I have made my decision.

992
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,133
Welcome back, ladies.

993
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,867
You are all my heroes.

994
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:59,066
And you know that I know
what it took

995
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:02,266
for each of you
to get here tonight.

996
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,600
So no matter what happens,

997
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,567
you are champions.

998
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,600
Tyra Sanchez,
the next drag superstar

999
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,200
needs to be
consistently dynamic.

1000
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,133
You're safe.

1001
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,266
- Thank you.

1002
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,133
- Jujubee,

1003
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:21,834
you had us at "gay-sha ."

1004
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,233
You're safe.

1005
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,500
- Thank you.

1006
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,300
- Tatianna,

1007
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,500
you're young and talented...

1008
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
but you fumbled your interview.

1009
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
And you came to the main stage

1010
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,800
dressed like a referee.

1011
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,066
- I'm sorry, my dear.

1012
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,567
you are up for elimination.

1013
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,433
- When I find out
that I'm in the bottom two,

1014
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,900
my mouth goes completely dry.

1015
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm not ready to go home.

1016
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,834
- Pandora Boxx.

1017
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:54,367
The judges were not
absolutely impressed.

1018
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,066
You're safe.

1019
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,400
- Thank you.

1020
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,567
- Raven.

1021
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,066
What can I say?

1022
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:04,333
You're young, broke,
and fabulous,

1023
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,433
and you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1024
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,066
Congratulations, Raven.

1025
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,734
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree

1026
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:15,100
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.

1027
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,266
- I finally won
a fucking challenge.

1028
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,100
And it was a big win to me.

1029
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,467
Thank you.

1030
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:25,333
- Jessica, you went wild
in your interview,

1031
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:29,700
but your cover did not snatch
any trophies from the judges.

1032
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,767
I'm sorry, my dear.

1033
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:35,834
you are up for elimination.

1034
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,967
- I need to win this,
because I don't think

1035
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,834
that I did a bad job
for going back home today.

1036
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,133
- Two queens stand before me.

1037
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:49,133
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1038
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,934
and save yourself

1039
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:55,233
from elimination.

1040
00:38:55,233 --> 00:39:00,100
The time has come
to lip-synch

1041
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,767
for your life.

1042
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:07,800
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

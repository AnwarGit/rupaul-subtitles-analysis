00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,000
the theme for this year's Pride

[cheers and applause]

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,100
- Jiggly is a hot mess.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,233
- Where the fuck are my
tits?

7
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,300
- Ahoy.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,567
Orange Jigglius.

9
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,367
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?

10
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:23,467
- I'm giving you maritime

11
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,133
realness with the starship
Willam.

12
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,166
- Milan.

13
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,333
- Her body language is totally

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,900
"dude in a dress."

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,533
- Willam, condragulations.

16
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,700
You are the winner of this
challenge.

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,567

18
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,734
shantay, you stay.

19
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:42,133
Milan, sashay away.

20
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,233
And tonight...

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,700
The library is open.

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,166
- You're such a fat slut,

25
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,367
after sex you smoke hams.

26
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:54,700
[laughter]

27
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,934
- And the dolls go glossy.

28
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,734

- Cluck, cluck, ladies.

44
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,166
- Where's our hangers?
- Wha-wha!

45
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,367
- Milan's gone, and now it's

46
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,066
down to the lucky seven.

47
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,400
- "Colored girl, why yo base

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,500
look like chalk?"

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,567
- I loved Milan, you guys.

50
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,800
Milan was a class act.

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,967
How did it feel to lip sync
against your mama?

52
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,400
Were you scared?

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,567
- No, 'cause I know Milan is

54
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,200
good, but then I know I'm good
too.

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,533
- Well...

56
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,533
- Do you think you're gonna
win the show?

57
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,633
- At least--

58
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,133
- That was an awkwardly long
pause.

59
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,400
- Yeah.

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,633
- I was at the bottom two

61
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,667
twice, so the girls are just

62
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,166
kinda, like, assuming that

63
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,433
I ain't shit.

64
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,266
- You went from a baked potato
to a sweet potato.

65
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,467
- Sweet potatoes have
antioxidants.

66
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:25,934
- But they're better.

67
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,667
- It's a good fat,
as they say.

68
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,500
- Dumbass bitches, I'm gonna

69
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,200
fight till the end.

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,066
I just wanna see her do what I

71
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,166
did with our without shoes.

72
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,233
- You wanna see me do a split?

73
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,700
- Go ahead, jump into a split.

74
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,734
- I can't jump into a split.

75
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:38,767
- Thank you, then shut the

76
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:42,066
fuck up, bitch.

77
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,066
- Bye, Milan.

78
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,633
We'll see you in New York City.

79
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,066
She as really defensive,
though, a lot.

80
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,667
- It's hard to come here and,
like,

81
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,400
people tell you
that you're not good

82
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,433
at what you've been doing.

83
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,834
- Oh, trust me, I get it.

84
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,934
I think the trick with dealing
with the judging panel

85
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,767
is just get them to tell you
that they have no notes

86
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,567
and that you're perfect.

87
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,934
[laughs]

88
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,300
Yeah, I won.

89
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
I was stunned.

90
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,834
I'm like,
"This is the best review

91
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,467
I've ever gotten in my life.

92
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,967
- You had your moment,
and you done had your shine.

93
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,300
Now, can we let it go, girl?

94
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,867
Because, boo-boo,
it's a new week

95
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,233
and a new challenge.

96
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,300
And you're in one week,
and you can slip the next.

97
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,767
No tea, no shade.

98
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,567
- I was fucking stunned
that they said that.

99
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,567
- Well, they upped
the smoke machine last night,

100
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,700
so they couldn't see your beard
coming through.

101
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,800
[laughter]

102
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,066
[alarm sounds]

103
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,100
- Ooh, girl!

104
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,066
You got shemail.

105
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,667
Extra, extra!

106
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,333
Tweet all about it!

107
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,700
Like a rolling stone, today's

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,867

00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,500
be a real hustler on time and

110
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,800
always in style.

111
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
So start spreading the news,

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,066
'cause you're gonna wake up in

113
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:58,734
a cyber city that never sleeps.

114
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,533
Hello, hello, hello.

- Yes!

123
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,100
- Because reading is what?

124
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,867
all: Fundamental!

125
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:19,867

Dida Ritz.

133
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,367
- I'm gonna try.

134
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:36,567
I don't know how to really read

135
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,300
that well, so...

136
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
does someone smell that?

You don't have to rock the yard

[laughter]

148
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,066

Darling, what do you see?

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,900

- Oh-oh.

152
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,066
- Dida, let me start with you,
boo.

153
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,467
- There's lotion in my purse.

154
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,467
You need to use them on your
elbows and your knees.

155
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,734
You look like you've been
driving through flour, baby.

157
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,166
Phi Phi O'Hara,

158
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,700
She wants her look back,
boo.

- [chuckles]

160
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,100
- Mama Chad, it's called

Forever 21, not Forever 41.

162
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,433
- [laughs]

163
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:24,066
- Willam, honey, your face
is made out of marble.

164
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,233
Shit don't move.

165
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:29,934
- Oh-oh.

166
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,066
Dida, you know,
I always think it's cute

167
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,867
to rock your mother's
two-piece sweater set

168
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,433

00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,066
Oh-oh.

- Oh, jujubee, you know,
helium's for balloons,

171
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,066
not your stomach.

172

Oh, and, you know, Willam,

I know you're talented at,

00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,166

00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,100
you know, drag?

176
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,266
You know, uh, Sharon, I love how

177
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,467
you rock the party city.

178
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,633

00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,934
Phi Phi sucked.

181
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,066
- Dida Ritz, I don't know if

182
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,533
that is hot couture or hot

183
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,100
"coutorn," 'cause there's holes
in that shirt.

184
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,300
There are holes in the garment.

185
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,066
Ooh, Jiggly.

186
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,667
Jiggly, uh, 31--yeah,
there should be 32.

187
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,300
- Ooh.

188
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,066
Phi Phi, you are gorgeous.

189
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,433
You catch the camera's eye
from the right.

190
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,767
But from the left, you snag it.

191
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,300
- Ohh!

192
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Crawlin' out the tar pits with
your relative the saber-tooth.

193
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,667
Visit it while you're in
Los Angeles.

194
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,300
- [laughs]

195
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,200
- Chad Michaels, you so old,
you still on

196
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,633
myspace.Com/chadmichaels.

197
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,066
- I was gonna take that down.

198
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,400
- Ladies and gentlemen,

199
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
welcome to the RuPaul ball.

200
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,266
Tonight in the category
of butch queen, Dida Ritz.

201
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,367
- Oh!

202
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,433
- Jiggly, I love you.

203
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,433
Come to mother dust.

204
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,934
Come here, come to me.

205
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,300
Come to me, I won't hurt you.

206
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,066
Here's my dentist's card.

207
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,066
Use it.

208
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,200
Willam Belli.

209
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,967
Willam Belli loves to live his

210
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,066
life and think that he's

211
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,233
Carrie Bradshaw.

212
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,867
But in the sequel, she'll be

213
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,166
playing Scary Bradshaw.

214
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,834
- Oh-oh.

215
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,166
- Latrice.

216
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,367
Latrice's feet are so big,

217
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,734
she will be starring
in the remake

218
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,467
of the beloved family favorite
<i>Flipper.</i>

219
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:23,633
[laughter]

220
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,967
- Jiggly Caliente, B.M.W.

221
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,066
Body Made Wrong.

222
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,300
[laughter]

223
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,100
Phi Phi O'Hara, although reading

224
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,967
is fundamental, darling, you

225
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,533
might learn how to spell first,

226
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,900
you illiterate fuck.

227
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,667
[laughter]

228
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,233
Willam, Miss Industry,

229
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,767
congratulations on your new role

230
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,066
as the big bad wolf by the hair

231
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,800
on your chinny, chin, chin.

232
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,767
- Yeah!

233
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,066
- Yes!

234
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,967
- Sharon Needles, two words...

235
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:54,934
sideshow freak.

236
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:59,066
[laughter]

237
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,700
- Dida Ritz, a lot of you girls

238
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,433
like to clock me for painting

239
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,433
my skin on the gray side, but

240
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,834
I was inspired by your knees.

241
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,100
- Oh!

242
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,200
- They're the same color
as Willam's chin.

243
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,533
- Oh-oh-oh!

244
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,133
- Phi Phi O'Hara, what brand

245
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,200
of makeup do you wear?

246
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,633
Sherman Williams?

247
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,800
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

248
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,066
- That was a weak one.

249
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:23,066
Latrice Royale, you know,
a lot of us have done

250
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,333
great work in bars.

251
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
You've done your best
behind them.

252
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,233
[laughter]

253
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:31,066
Jiggly Caliente, you're such

254
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:34,500
a fat slut,
after sex you smoke hams.

255
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,400
[laughter]

256
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,100
- [deep voice] The library is

257
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,300
permanently shut down.

258
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,166
Ooh, no tea, no shade.

259
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,066
And the winner is...

260
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,266
Latrice Royale.

261
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,500
[cheering]

262
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,834
- Yes.

263
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,633
- Condragulations, darling.

264
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,066
- Thank you, Mama.

265
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,433
- My girls.

266
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,066
For this week's main challenge,

267
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,667
I need you to conquer the world

268
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,066
of publishing.

269
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:13,767
You'll be launching your very
own dragazine.

270
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,734
Oh, pit crew!

271
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,066
As editor-in-chief, you'll each

272
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:21,467
be assigned a different title.

273
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,066
And then it's up to you to

274
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,533
create a cover, choose the

275
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,600
articles, and really make it
your own.

276
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,867
Now, Latrice, since you won

277
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,934
the mini challenge, you get to

278
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,066
assign the dragazines.

279
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,467
- Oh.

280
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,333
- She's picking<i> </i>

- Are you trying to say

00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,133
- Please do.

00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,934

Celebrity gossip
for Latrice Royale.

307
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,533
All right, ladies, you are on

308
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,266
a tight deadline,
so get to work.

309
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,934
Gentlemen, start your engines,

310
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,734
and may the best woman win.

311
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,934
- I think what makes this

312
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,900
challenge so hard is we've not

313
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,433
had to do anything like this.

314
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,633
It kinds separates the

315
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,033
intellectual people from

316
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:51,133
the not-so-intellectual people.

317
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,800
- Jiggly does go right for that

318
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,900
snack bin, honey.

319
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,433
It helps her think, I think.

320
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,533
Crunch, crunch.

321
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,734
"Oh, yeah, I got an idea."

322
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,633
Crunch, crunch.
Health and fitness.

323
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,567
Ha!

324
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,667
- Jiggly.
- [belches]

325
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,934
- Any complaints?

326
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:12,934
- What the fuck do I know

327
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:14,133
about working out?

328
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,400
- I know, right!

329
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,333
- Shit.

330
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,066
- See, I'm helping you out,
girl.

331
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,100
- Did they say we have to make
these comedy?

332
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,233
- Never hurts.

333
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,867
- You gotta grab your
attention--do like

334
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:28,066
the headlines that are on your
back to front cover.

335
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,333
- The thing is, like, me and

336
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,667
comedy obviously doesn't mix.

337
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,934
I think I'm just gonna be real
about it.

338
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,066
- I do not suggest you do this
for real.

339
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,066
I'm sorry.

340
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,367
I think you should make it
funny.

341
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,467
Everybody likes to laugh.

342
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,767
That's my advice to you.

343
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,867
- My only advice with that is

344
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,066
that if you feel like you can

345
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,467
get more with the serious route,

346
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,633
I'd rather you have a consistent

347
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,433
magazine that you can follow
by.

348
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,400
- Phi Phi...shady.

349
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,233
- 'Cause if you fuck up funny,
then it's gonna fuck up bad.

350
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,633
- Exactly.

351
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:54,967
For me, it's hard to find

352
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,967
the funny in weight loss.

353
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:56,934
Hell, no, no.

354
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,133
I'm gonna be serious, and I'm

355
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,800
gonna do this the right way

356
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,333
emotionally.

357
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,166
- He's doing a serious one
for his.

358
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,200
- What?

359
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,166
Are you kidding?

360
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,266
- No.

361
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,200
- His humor is, like,
his strongest thing.

362
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,834
- I know that he's gonna mess
up if he does, like, serious.

363
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,233
So I was like, "No,
you should do serious."

364
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm tired of Jiggly.

365
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,767
She doesn't belong here.

366
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,100
Send her ass home.

367
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,500
Did you wanna help pack his
bags?

368
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:23,934
[laughs maniacally]

369
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,066
Ahh, you stupid bitch.

370
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,266
- Today we get to be
editors-in-chief

371
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:35,367
of our own dragazine.

372
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,567
- I have<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>

373
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,734
- We have to design a cover,
pose for it,

374
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,767
and come up with
eye-catching headlines.

375
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,300
"How to stop over-salting
your food,"

376
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,100
'cause I always hear people
talk about that.

377
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,667
Like, people always salt
their food too much, you know.

378
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,066
I really want to, like, almost

379
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,100
class this up a little bit.

380
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,767
It can easily come off as
offensive.

381
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:51,800
You know, a black woman on

382
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,300
the cover of a magazine saying--

383
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,934
with a title like that.

384
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:56,467
- [laughs]

385
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,500
Girl, go on.

386
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,300
- It's like, I don't even like
to really eat chicken in public.

387
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,600
- Girl, really?

388
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,266
- I don't eat watermelon in
public, because people are

389
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,700
ignorant and people make
comments.

390
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,734
- I know, girl, but--

391
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,900
- It's disrespectful and rude.

392
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,166
- 5 Gs, please.

393
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,400
Good God, get a grip, girl.

394
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,633
'Cause it's not that serious.

395
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,166
Really, you're a dude in a wig.

396
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,100
[laughs]

397
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,967
- Latrice, she set you up.

398
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:20,900
- She set me up.

399
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,667
Latrice was trying
to gook a bitch.

400
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,233
- [laughs]

401
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,300
- Can I please win a challenge?

402
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,834
Hopefully, I could exchange my
mini challenges for a win.

403
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,300
- You should step up your game,
girl.

404
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,567
Win a big one.

405
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,667
- So far in this competition,

406
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,700
I haven't won a main challenge.

407
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,166
Doing graphic and web design,

408
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,066
this is what I do
in my day job,

409
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,300
so if I lose this challenge,

410
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,834
it's gonna make me upset.

411
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,400
Honestly,
I don't want<i> Sugar Walls.</i>

412
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,367
- This is the one I wanted.

413
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,633
- Really?
- Yeah.

414
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,867
- Well, I'm glad for you,
but I did not want that.

415
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,300
You're a sarcastic little bitch,

416
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,567
so you'll come up
with something.

417
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,400
- Where there's a Willam,
there's a way.

418
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,367
The only problem I'm having
in the workroom today is,

419
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,967
I just want to tell
the others girls,

420
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,867
"You can stop.
I'm gonna win."

421
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,500
- Hello, hello, hello.

422
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,800
[together]
Hi, Ru.
Hi.

423
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,266
- How are my future media
moguls doing?

424
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,333
- Fabulous.

425
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,633
- Well, well,
busy at work here.

426
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,800
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>

427
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,834
How are you gonna convey Dida

428
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:19,967
in "Chicken of the Month?

429
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,100
- Well, "Chicken of the Month,"

430
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,166
I mean,
there's so many different ways

431
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,200
you can cook chicken.

432
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,467
- Seriously?

433
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:25,800
I would've took that whole
chicken thing into

434
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,367
a whole
different direction.

435
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,667
- You can broil it,
you can fry it.

436
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,233
- But how will we know this
is Dida?

437
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,400
- It's me.

438
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,567
Who else would think of
"Chicken of the month"?

439
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,200
I haven't heard Oprah come up
with it yet.

440
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,667
I mean,
you're fascinated by that.

441
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,600
You want to pick up the magazine
and look at it.

442
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,667
- Well...

443
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,066
- "Chicken of the Month" for me.

444
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:43,066
- Uh-huh, okay.

445
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,533
- I believe in my idea, and if

446
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:45,867
it makes me have to lip sync

447
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,066
for my life, then so be it.

448
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,266
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

449
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,867
<i>Sashay Away.</i>

450
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,133
So tell me about the cover.

451
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,433
- Well, I'm channeling

452
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,967
the horny gay, like 69 hot spots

453
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,300
for hookups.

454
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,367
- You know, the challenge is

455
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,600
to combine travel and Phi Phi

456
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,233
O'Hara's esthetic.

457
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,333
How are you gonna do that?

458
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,066
- Well, Phi Phi's sexy.

459
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,066
I'm just gonna, you know,

460
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,200
showcase my sexiness.

461
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,667
- This reminds me of when you

462
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,133
told me you were going to make

463
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,066
Lady Gaga really pop.

464
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,500
Do you remember that
conversation?

465
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,100
- She popped;
it might not have been in a

466
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,266
good way,
but she popped.

467
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,333
- All right, get to work.

468
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,867
- All righty, thanks, Ru.

469
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,900
- Sharon Needles.
- Hi.

470
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,767
-<i> Kitty Cat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
Who is this magazine for?

471
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,467
- Well, you know,
I see the cat magazines

472
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,400
at the pet store,
and they're always geared to,

473
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,066
like, grandmas and, like,

474
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,467
sad ladies that never
fell in love and stuff.

475
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,600
So this is more for, like,
Edie Beale,

476
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,233
that, you know, have cats,

477
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,700
because they're cheaper
than boyfriends.

478
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,433
- So, now, what does<i> </i>
<i>Kitty Cats</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine say</i>

479
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,667
about Sharon Needles?

480
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,967
- [meows]

481
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,467
- Now, listen.

482
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:58,233
I want you to make
your dragazine appeal to me.

483
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,300
Even though I don't have a cat.

484
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,633
I want you to make me want
to get a cat.

485
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,600
- Okay.

486
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,967
- And just knock 'em dead,
kiddo.

487
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,700
- I will.
Thanks a lot.

488
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,433
- Willam.
- Hi.

489
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,266
- Editrix-in-chief of

490
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,533
<i>Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>

491
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,233
- I prefer editor-in-queef.

492
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,900
- [laughs]

493
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,633
So now who would you say is your

494
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,066
target audience for<i> Sugar Walls?</i>

495
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,834
- Um...

496
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,233
women.

497
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,900
Men.

498
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
- All of the above.
- Uh-huh.

499
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,567
- It's a little broad to just
do men and women.

500
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,066
And, you know, there is

501
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,266
a certain esthetic that you have
that's very clear-cut.

502
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,333
That's what we wanna see in this
magazine.

503
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,333
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

504
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,200
Jiggly Caliente.

505
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,233
- Hey, Mama.

506
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,367
- May I call you Jiggly?

507
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,066
- Oh, Mama,
you can call me Jiggly anytime.

508
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,900
- Oh.<i> Battle of the Bulge.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.

509
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,633
- Were you insulted by being
assigned that magazine?

510
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:57,700
- Yes, I've done some bad
things to lose weight.

511
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,934
- Well, what kind of things
have you done?

512
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:04,300
- I decided to binge and eat

513
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,166
a lot and throw it all up.

514
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,333
And I would say that it's not

515
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,600
the smartest thing to do.

516
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,533
And I just think that when it

517
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,767
comes to weight loss, it's not

518
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,900
a joking matter.

519
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,700
- You've been able to process

520
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,500
what people think of you through
your humor.

521
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,400
I mean, you're Jiggly Caliente.

522
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,433
That's your name.

523
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,633
Embrace the Jiggly.

524
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,934
- I am, I'm--

525
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:26,633
- Do you hear what I'm saying
to you?

526
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,066
- Yeah.
- You're funny.

527
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,066
Do that.

528
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,400
It's not rocket science.

529
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,834
- I'm going to stick to my guns,

530
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,533
because this,
I'm not questioning this.

531
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,200
This is the right way for me.

532
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,533
- Okay, all right.

533
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,767
Well, you got your work cut out
for you, Jiggly.

534
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,066
- Yes, I do.

535
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,333
- Think about it.

536
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,767
Chad Michaels.

537
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,934
- RuPaul.

538
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:47,233
- Editor-in-chief
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dragazine.</i>

539
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,333
- Finally.
- [laughs]

540
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,800
- I've been waiting.

541
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,233
<i>Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine is going</i>
to be geared toward drags

542
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,767
and the women who love drags.

543
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,734
Sort of the major is gonna be,
"Dusted or Busted?

544
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,800
The Fashion and Runway Trashin'

545
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Season 4.</i>

546
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,467
- Oh, so this is an inside look
at some of the fashion

547
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,967
we've seen so far
in this season.

548
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,266
- And the inside scoop.

549
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,300
- I want to know that.

550
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,934
- It's gonna be fantastic.

551
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:12,533
- I can't wait to see
what the<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman</i>

552
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,300
is wearing next season.

553
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,467
[roaring]

554
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,200
- I'd like to show you.
Drag cougar, honey.

555
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,300
- [laughs]

556
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,700
Them old girls still have it.

557
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
- Yes. All right, kiddo.
See you later.

558
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,066
- Thanks, Ru.
Thank you.

559
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,066
Well, Latrice Royale.

560
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,567
Girl,<i> What's the T?</i>

561
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,133
- What's the T, Ru?

562
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,834
- How are you gonna make your

563
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,967
dragazine something that is

564
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,066
relevant in the 21st century?

565
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,433
- You're gonna wanna buy it

566
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,600
once you see me on the cover

567
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,500
because everyone knows that

568
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,066
Latrice is the true "T".

569
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,500
- Well, the publications at

570
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,567
the grocery have stars on

571
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,166
the cover, and they have star

572
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,800
names in their articles.

573
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,066
- Oh.

574
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,900
So I'm gonna go back to my
research department.

575
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
- Yes.
- I'll get it there.

576
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,066
- You get to it.
- Thank you.

577
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,667
- All right, dolls,
gather round.

578
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,467
Tomorrow night is the launch
of your dragazines.

579
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,900
We'll be joined by our extra

580
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,433
special guest judges.

581
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,667
platinum-selling country artist

582
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,066
Pam Tillis will be here.

583
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,800
- Yee-haw!

584
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,400
- Pam Tillis, old-school

585
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,467
country diva, honey.

586
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,433
- And an actress I've loved

587
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:24,233
since she was a child on<i> 227.</i>

588
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,800
The star TV's<i> Southland,</i>

589
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,333
Regina King will be here.

590
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,200
[cheering]

591
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,333
- I love Regina King.

592
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,400
She's on a show called<i> </i>
<i>Southland.</i>

593
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Oh, wait, I was on a show called
<i>Southland.</i>

594
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,066
- Oh, and one last thing.

595
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,934
Don't fuck it up.

596
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,667
All right, bye.

597
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,934
- Bye, Ru.

598
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,734
- Hi, gorgeous.

599
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,367
- Hi.
Ooh, hi. How are you?

600
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,834
- Good,
I'm Jonathan Clay Harris.

601
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,767
So what are we doing today?

602
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,200
- Our challenge this week is,

603
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,066
we have to develop our own
dragazine.

604
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,100
So now we're gonna pose for our
fabulous cover.

605
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,900
My magazine
is<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>

606
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,233
I want it to be a sexy magazine
but with chicken.

607
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,900
- Yeah, give me some sexy.

608
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,200
Sex appeal with that one.

609
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,233
Oh, my God, chicken?

610
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,834
Chicken?

611
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,333
- Chicken.
- Yeah, work that chicken.

612
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,533
Show me a little hunger
in those eyes.

613
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,700
- What drag queen do you know

614
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,600
that has taken a head shot
with chicken?

615
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,767
Chicken!

616
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,467
- And what are you serving
for dinner tonight?

617
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,233
- Look at you.
You look gorgeous.

618
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,333
- Yeah, you too.

619
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,300
- Oh, thank you.

620
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,800
- Have you done porn?

621
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
- Not recently.

622
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,567
- Well, you should really
consider it.

623
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:41,633
Thought it would be a genius

624
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,100
idea mounting the cat climber,

625
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,333
channeling my inner kitty cat.

626
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,533
- Just be careful.

627
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,333
- I can trust myself.

628
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,367
- All right, Sharon, I don't
think this is working.

629
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,633
Let's go back.

630
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,166
- God, you don't know anything

631
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,133
about fashion.

632
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,066
Okay, we're gonna just do
chairs.

633
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,967
- There you go.

634
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,800
- Work that hand...
<i>Eleganza.</i>

635
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,066
- I wanted to seem like

636
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,867
a powerful bitchy mogul woman.

637
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,800
- Let's get a little more of
that pussy in there.

638
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,066
There you are.

639
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,233
Beautiful, right there.

640
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,700
- I was totally giving
the camera nothing but legs,

641
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,367
and I was giving them pure
cunt face.

642
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,367
- Beautiful.

643
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,867
- I feel sexy in anything,

644
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,400
even a body bag.

645
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,467
- Hello.
How are you?

646
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,867
- Oh, wow.

647
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,066
- So what's your magazine cover
that you're doing today?

648
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,066
- I'm doing, uh...

649
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,834
what was it?

650
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,734
Bulge of--<i> </i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>

651
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,233
-<i> Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> okay.</i>

652
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,066
Are those RuPaul's
Iron Fist shoes?

653
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,667
- Yeah, these are RuPaul
Iron Fist shoes.

654
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,934
- Those are amazing.

655
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,066
- Aren't they sickening?

656
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,066
- They're sickening.

657
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,166
- This is the most exercise I'm

658
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,533
gonna get for the rest
of my life.

659
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,633
- Oh, no.

660
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,667
Here we go.

661
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:57,767
Little<i> Kill Bill</i><span style="bodyStyle"> action.</i>

662
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,300
Here we go.

663
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,066
- God, if Phi Phi was just in
front of me, I could've knocked

664
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,700
her ass out for all that shit
she be running her mouth with.

665
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Please don't trip me.

666
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,734
- We won't.

667
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,467
- One, two, three.

668
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,467
- Okay, once more, here we go.

669
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,533
[laughs]

670
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:21,667
- Doesn't matter, as long as
it looks like

671
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,467
it's in the air.

672
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,233
- Let's do it again.
Loosen a little bit.

673
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,900
Just mind your face
when you're jumping.

674
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,934
- Okay, I'm cool.

675
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:32,433
One, two...

676
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,934
- I just didn't think that

677
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,700
it kind of worked with Jiggly.

678
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,200
She just seemed so completely

679
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,066
uncomfortable with the camera.

680
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,867
- And you have to spot me.

681
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,500
- Point your eyes at me just
for a couple frames.

682
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,200
Gorgeous.
Look at those eyes.

683
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
- So my final wardrobe for

684
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,066
the photograph is really kind

685
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,867
of a '40s glam red carpet dress.

686
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:53,867
I could see someone like

687
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,166
Veronica Lake wearing it to

688
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,734
a movie premiere.

689
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,500
- And what do the goggles say
about your outfit?

690
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,667
- The goggles say,
"she's an adventurer and she's

691
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,667
fashion-forward."

692
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,200
- She looks like it.

693
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,367
- Right now it is important for

694
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,700
me to get out there and give

695
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,467
the judges some variety to be

696
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,767
a little bit less polished,

697
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,867
to be avant-garde.

698
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:11,934
I think I'm good.

699
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,834
I think we got it.

700
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,333
- I wanna look like--like--

701
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,667
like a hot Miami piece of ass.

702
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,800
Like you wanna visit me.

703
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,967
- Work, here we go.

704
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:20,900
You look like it to me.

705
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,567
- Good.
- Let's do it.

706
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,266
Miami, honey.

707
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,633
I wanna go for a more sexier

708
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,767
side of Phi Phi, something that

709
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,066
I haven't showed yet, and, you

710
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,166
know, I wanna be, like, a whore

711
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,333
on this magazine and have whore

712
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,333
headlines.

713
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,767
- Let's see some sex
in those eyes.

714
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,100
Here we go.

715
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,200
- I'm throwing you, like,
a Farrah Fawcett sexy look,

716
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,800
and, you know, I had the drink
in my hand.

717
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,333
I'm holding the umbrella.

718
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,133
Hold on, I don't want
my muscles showing.

719
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,967
I gotta look like a woman.

720
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:44,433
- You wanna look at 'em?
- Yeah, I feel sexy already.

721
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,700
So let's look at 'em.

722
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,266
I'm prettier than the other
girls, aren't I?

723
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,300
You can say it.

724
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,633
- I'm not going to.
- You should.

725
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,700
Delete that one.

726
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,767
That looks like a man.

727
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,700
I look like Sharon in that one.
- Okay.

728
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
[laughter]

729
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,734
Ouch.

730
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,567
- Yes, Mama, right there.

731
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,567
Good.

732
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:00,700
Beautiful.

733
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,533
Boys, I want you touching her.

734
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:06,166
- So<i> What's the T?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is a gossip</i>
column magazine.

735
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:10,266
Of course I'm featured on the
cover with my boys.

736
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,834
The boys.
Always helps when you have boys.

737
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,467
Come and join me on the couch.

738
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,734
Let's have a ménage à trois.

739
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,367
The boys, of course, is just for

740
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,300
my sheer amusement and pleasure.

741
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Come do something.
Come rub on me.

742
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,500
Let me rub on you.

743
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,300
- Latrice, look at me.

744
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,800
Eyes at me, everyone.

745
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,967
Eyes at me.
Sex in the face.

746
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,667
Look at me.

747
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,533
- I love my boys,
and that's the "T".

748
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
- Sex sells, people.

749
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,200
Sex sells.

750
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,734
My overall concept is
stripped-down design.

751
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,600
Mama needs some tape.

752
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,433
Your head is so unprofessional.

753
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,667
- [chuckling]

754
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,066
- I tried to dress the pit crew

755
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,400
as lamps and put lamp shades on

756
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,600
their head, but their heads

757
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,967
aren't even.

758
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,867
And they wouldn't let me put
nails in them.

759
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,200
And remember to flex, boys.

760
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
I don't want you looking puny.

761
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
[laughter]

762
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,066
No faces, you don't exist.

763
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,667
- Willam was beautiful and

764
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,233
definitely knew her body.

765
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,633
- [laughing]

766
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,633

<i>♪ Now that Kenya's gone ♪</i>

768
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:09,867
- I thought she was a little
bitchy.

769
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,100
You guys look amazing.

770
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,266
- Please don't address them.

771
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,200
- Right.

772
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,166
- You can't fuck me.

773
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,900
[laughs]

774
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,967
I'm gonna fall.

775
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,900
- Good.

776
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,300
Let's take a look at these.

777
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,367
- I'm naked, I'm tan,
and I have boys around me.

778
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,767
I'm happy with the photo shoot.

779
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,467
All right, now clean this
shit up.

780
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:31,500
[upbeat music]

781
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
[indistinct chatter]

782
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,967
- Good morning,
mother cluckers.

783
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,533
- We're back.
- We're back!

784
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,066
- We're back in the workroom
today,

785
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,233
and we're getting ready
to present our magazines on

786
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,600
the runway in our glossy glamour
looks.

787
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,066
- How did your challenge go
for you guys?

788
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:46,333
- Mine went well.

789
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,533
- I liked mine.

790
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:49,500
- Well, you have a health and
fitness magazine.

791
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,867
Why would you go serious
on that?

792
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,900
Obviously you were assigned
that magazine to, you know,

793
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
ham it up.

794
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,633
[laughter]

795
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,834
- There's more to me than just

796
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,133
being funny and goofy.

797
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,834
1240 on the SATs.

798
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,600
I need to show that I have
intelligence.

799
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Girl.

800
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,934
- Latrice, does your family

801
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,600
still live--where are you from
again?

802
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,100
- Atlanta.

803
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,767
- Have you ever been, like,
bullied or whatever by family?

804
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:15,900
- From my brother, yeah.

805
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,500
He didn't want no punk for
a brother.

806
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,867
- My dad did that in front of,
like,

807
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,266
his fucking drinking
buddies.

808
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,300
I grew up in a house where

809
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,467
I was beat and made fun of for

810
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,633
being gay.

811
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,900
It was hell.

812
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,667
Family's supposed to love you
no matter what.

813
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,967
And if that's love,
I don't want it.

814
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,066
- You couldn't hold hands,

815
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,066
kiss, look at each other in

816
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,600
Texas without getting called

817
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,700
a faggot or anything.

818
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,967
- What kills me is that they

819
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,967
wanna say that we're the ones

820
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,233
destroying the institution
of marriage.

821
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,233
Please.

822
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,734
- You know, I've met gay people,
though,

823
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,200
that don't agree with
gay marriage.

824
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
- I--okay, here we go.
Since y'all brought it up.

825
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,967
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

826
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,066
- I just don't want it to be
called marriage.

827
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,500
For me, marriage describes

828
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,900
a straight relationship.

829
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,233
And I think we should be called

830
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,333
something else.

831
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,700
Call it something more fabulous.

832
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,100
- As a gay man, it's just hard

833
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,400
for me to believe that you don't

834
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,633
want equal rights for yourself.

835
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:01,967
- I did not say that.

836
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,100
- But if it's all the same

837
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,200
thing as marriage,
why not call it that?

838
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,834
- Because it's not the same
thing to me.

839
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:07,900
- Yes, it is.

840
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,066
- I will be pissed if Latrice

841
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,133
is gonna be the first one that

842
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,100
gets married too, bitch.

843
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,367
- Hell to the no.

844
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,200
- I fully support gay divorce.

845
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200

- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, Ru.

849
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,667
- Welcome to the main stage of

00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,400
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

851
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,333
Michelle Visage, you old tool.

- What you talking 'bout, tool?

853
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,934
- On newsstands everywhere,

854
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,166
it's Santino Rice.

855
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,233

Black and blue.

857
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,200
- Grammy award-winner

858
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I am so excited you're here.

859
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,767
- You are like a song.

860
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,166
I'm telling you.

Hey, girl, you look like

865
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,734
- Oh, thank you.
So do you.

866
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,367
You have to show me how you

867
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,700
create the hair blowing without

868
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,834
the fan look.

00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,600
- [laughs]

870
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,367
This week, our queens went to

the presses to launch a new

to pump up your circulation.

874
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,700
Gentlemen, start your engines,

875
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,500

First up, Sharon Needles in

black and white, editorial.

878
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,700
- She's black and white and
fierce all over.

879
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,834
- This is a glamorous look for
Sharon Needles.

880
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,767
- It is.

881
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:52,200
- I'm feeling like

883
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,300
I feel stunning.

884
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,934
- Her booty looks awesome
in that dress.

885
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,367
- Yes, thanks, DuPont.

00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,700
Very<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>

887
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,467
- I was thinking
Jackie Collins.

888
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,166
- Kind of like a possessed
Jackie Collins.

889
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,800
- Yes, yes.

890
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Up next, Dida Ritz.

891
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,667
- Not just a cracker.
- No.

892
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:09,734
- What'd you call me?

893
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,100
- I love the little "S" walk.

894
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
- Yes, it's a strategic walk

895
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,767
so a sniper can't get her.

896
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,633
[laughter]

897
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:17,700
- I'm serving you

editor-in-chief realness.

899
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,433
Old Hollywood glamour.

900
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,667
I feel sexy.

901
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:22,800
- Tastes like chicken.

902
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,133
Looks like fish.

903
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,233
- Uh-uh.

904
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,900
- Chad Michaels.

905
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,166

My paint is much darker
than usual.

910

I'm loving my short hair.

911
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:37,266

a two-page spread.

- I want the judges to take it
all in, catch it.

948
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:42,734
Look at all the Swarovskis.

949
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,734
I want them to try to count how

950
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:45,266
many Swarovski there are on
this gown.

951
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,100
I look like a fucking
lemon drop.

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,166
A blinging lemon drop.

953
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,500
- That's a pretty dress.

I love me a train.

I'm gonna leave that alone.

- Phi Phi O'Hara.

959
00:30:58,667 --> 00:30:59,667
- Ooh.

960
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,533
- Wow.
Serving body and turquoise.

961
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:03,834
- I love the proportion.

962
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,266
- Yeah.
- Love all that leg.

963
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,233
Beautiful.

964
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,867
- Go on and take
the center stage.

965
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,934
- Walking down the runway,
I'm feeling super sexy and

966
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,867
flirty, and I'm just having
a good time out there.

967
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:13,800
It's a fishy outfit,
I look really pretty in it.

00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,066
I look glamorous.

969

Hello, dolls.

00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:31,233
whose are just conde nasty.

976
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:34,133
Up first, Chad Michaels.

978
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:36,633
- Yes.

979
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,100
- I wanted to take the theme

980
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,066
of<i> Eleganza,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> which was style,</i>

981
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,066
and gear it toward drag cougars

982
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,333
and the women who love them.

983
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,533
- I didn't know what type of
magazine it was.

984
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,600
It's just all over the place.

985
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,867
- It looks like something that

986
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,166
you would pick up for free at

987
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,266
the grocery store.

988
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,633
You look beautiful tonight.

989
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,700
Love the one-shoulder.

990
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,066
You look great in black.

991
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,233
- You guys challenged me to

992
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,233
dirty it up a little bit,

993
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,400
and I feel fantastic.

994
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,200
- I love that Chad thinks
this is dirty.

995
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,633
I guess it is for Chad.

996
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,200
- All right, up next,

997
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,500
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>

998
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,233
- Yeah, that's what they say.

999
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,633
- I wanted to add a little bit

1000
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,066
of, you know, glamour to it,

1001
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,367
and my inspiration was really

1002
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,667
the type of women you see on

1003
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,734
the Food Network.

1004
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,667
- I saw "stop."

1005
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,400
It kind of is at odds with your

1006
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
fun look and your fun colors,

1007
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,767
and then this negative message.

1008
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,066
- I like black hair on you.

1009
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,066
It looks very pretty.

1010
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,567
Just next time think more
volume.

1011
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:28,700
I keep telling you more volume.

1012
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,667
It's all about the silhouette.

1013
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,900
- All right, next up,

1014
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Meow.

1016
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,500
- I wanted to create a hip cat

1017
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,066
magazine for, like, young

1018
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,567
hipsters that love cats.

1019
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,834
- Oh, you nasty bitch.

1020
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,200
You--oh, my God, I love

1021
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,533
the headlines.

1022
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,600
I just wanna read it.

1023
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,867
I wanna know how many is too
many.

1024
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,867
- Well, I'm talking about cats.
You're a pervert.

1025
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:56,100
- Oh, I know, I know,
I know.

1026
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,767
But the eyes scare me.

1027
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,600
- They're my trademark.

1028
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,633
- But everything else is just

1029
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:04,100
so pretty and elegant.

1030
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,066
It, like, creeps me out.

1031
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,567
- I am still waiting to see

1032
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:12,066
full-on glam, no eyes,
no Goth Sharon Needles.

1033
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:13,133
Just once.

1034
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:16,467
I don't think you'll lose you.

1035
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:19,066
- Next up, Latrice Royale.

1036
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,567
<i>What's the T?</i>

1037
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,934
- If my magazine was on the

1038
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,567
newsstand, if you're not picking

1039
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,100
it up for me, you're definitely

1040
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
gonna pick it up for the hot

1041
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,266
boys that are lusting after me,
so...

1042
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,667
- I sort of expected your

1043
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,066
magazine to be like, "Shh!"

1044
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,133
- It looks like the name of the

1045
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,533
magazine is "Hollywood."

1046
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:37,300
It looks more like a club flyer.

1047
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,834
- You don't need the pit crew

1048
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,100
boys on there at all.

1049
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
It really looks like you got

1050
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,633
some hookers somewhere.

1051
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,667
- This gown that you came out

1052
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:48,066
in, it's like, ugh,
that's so heavy.

1053
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,233
It looks like a couch from
Rent-A-Center.

1054
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:53,066
- I think there's a little too
much jewelry; I don't know.

1055
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,533
- Oh, Lord, Jesus.

- Oh, oh.

1059
00:33:58,266 --> 00:33:59,266
- Oh.

1060
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:00,900
My bracelet breaks.

1061
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,600
Oh, fuck.

1062
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,500
In front of everybody.

1063
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,166
- But already that looks
better.

1064
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,734
It does.

1065
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:10,700
- Next up, Willam.

1066
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,934
<i>Sugar Walls.</i>

1067
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:13,767
- I love home design, and I

1068
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,500
made one of the pillows
on the cover.

1069
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,367
I'm a power bottom like that.

1070
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:19,633
- I love what you look like

1071
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,266
tonight, but in the beard area,

1072
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:24,066
we see the shadow again tonight.

1073
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,734
- Touch this.
Touch all of this.

1074
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,533
- I'm trying to help because
you're the only one that has it.

1075
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,266
So it really hits hard when it's
out there.

1076
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:35,734
- Your dragazine cover is
possibly the worst one.

1077
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:36,867
I hate the font.

1078
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,967
- Me too.
- Okay.

1079
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,066
- This looks like a porn thing
about to happen.

1080
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,266
I'm getting anything but
decorating from this.

1081
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,433
- Yeah, I wouldn't have hired

1082
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,200
myself to be that designer.

1083
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,734
I love the ideas that I had.

1084
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:49,800
I wish I had more time to

1085
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,500
execute them and a better staff.

1086
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,533
- See, my career I've had to do

1087
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:55,834
every single part of
show business.

1088
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,500
You know, edit, produce,
you name it.

1089
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,066
And that's what we're really
looking for.

1090
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,834
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.

1091
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,200
May I call you Jiggly?

1092
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,266
- No.

1093
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:11,066
- [laughs]

1094
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,500
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>

1095
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,233
- I found the funny, and I

1096
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,066
found the silly humor in it.

1097
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:18,066
<i>Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
ya, ya, ya!

1098
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:19,166
- I think with<i> Battle of the</i>

1099
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,200
<i>Bulge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> you could have really</i>

1100
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600
taken it anywhere.

1101
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,734
- Yeah, because when we spoke

1102
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,900
in the workroom, I was going on

1103
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,667
and on about you should approach

1104
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,900
it with more humor.

1105
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,467
- I chose to play with words

1106
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,500
instead of the humor because

1107
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,200
I don't know anything about
fitness.

1108
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,333
What the hell would I write

1109
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,333
about, how to eat a pound
of chicken?

1110
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,266
- Exactly, that's funny.

1111
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,300
- Oh, damn.

1112
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,333
[laughter]

1113
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,600
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

1114
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,200
You got<i> Sashay Away,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the travel dragazine.

1115
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,467
Wow, va-va-voom.

1116
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:53,266
- This is the best I've ever
seen you look so far.

1117
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,400
- Yeah, all the proportions
are right.

1118
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,500
Cute little outfit.

1119
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,367
Your makeup looks lovely.

1120
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,300
- Thank you.
- What happened?

1121
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,567
[laughing]

1122
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,667
- You look gorgeous on
the cover.

1123
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:08,066
The color makes me wanna go
wherever you are.

1124
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,500
This looks like an actual
magazine.

1125
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,667
- You picked all the key words
to highlight.

1126
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:16,200
Bathhouse, 69, virginity.

1127
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,166
I would read this inside
and out.

1128
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:22,400
- All right, ladies, while you

1129
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,433
enjoy an Absolut cocktail in

1130
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,066
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

1131
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:29,433
the judges and I will
deliberate.

1132
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,700
All right, just between us

1133
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,133
girls, what do you think?

1134
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,667
Chad Michaels.

1135
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,100
- The runway really made up for

1136
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,400
the look that's on the cover

1137
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,834
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine,</i>
which is horrible.

1138
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,834
- And it's just not modern
or hip.

1139
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,200
- If you're looking for hip,
young, and trendy, you ain't

1140
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,333
gonna find it in Chad Michaels.

1141
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,533
- Dida Ritz.

1142
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:52,867
- I'm just kind of thinking

1143
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,567
she's somewhere in the middle
today.

1144
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,066
She was cute on the cover.

1145
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:59,734
- I never equate fabulous drag
queens and cute.

1146
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,333
- Right.
- I wanna be devastated.

1147
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,700
- She comes out like a straight
line with these big football

1148
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,066
player shoulders with flat hair.

1149
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:10,266
She's a pretty girl, but it
seems like we're getting stuck

1150
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,066
here a little bit with Dida.

1151
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,266
- All right, let's move on to
Sharon Needles.

1152
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,734
- I really like her sense of
comedy.

1153
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,300
There's something really cool
about her.

1154
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,200
- Yeah, her dragazine,
very funny, tongue in cheek.

1155
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,133
And it looks like it reeks of
cat piss in there.

1156
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:28,300
- I did like her dragazine.

1157
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,834
- Do I think it's the best?
No.

1158
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,567
- Latrice Royale.

1159
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,667
- The dragazine cover was like

1160
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,700
Sydney Biddle Barrows, you know?

1161
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,700
It was like a madam's calling
card.

1162
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,767
- Willam and<i> Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dragazine.

1163
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,066
- She totally missed the mark,

1164
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,433
and I really feel like this was

1165
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,633
probably one of the easiest

1166
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:46,633
ones to do.

1167
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,266
And there's something about her

1168
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,433
on stage that's a bit robotic.

1169
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,100
It's like she stood there with

1170
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,700
the same exact smile.

1171
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,934
It was kind of creepy.

1172
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,367
I kept, like, looking over to

1173
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,500
see, all right, okay, 20 minutes

1174
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,367
has passed by, and she was
still...

1175
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,633
- Yeah, that don't move.

1176
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:05,567
- She's got a major attitude,

1177
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,467
and I like that, though.

1178
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:08,467
Good news, bad news.

1179
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:09,700
Good news, she's a diva.

1180
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,500
Bad news, she's a diva.

1181
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,734
- Jiggly Caliente and

1182
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,700
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>

1183
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,300
- You know, Jiggly seems to be

1184
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,066
some sort of self-sabotage.

1185
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:19,967
- Yes.

1186
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,300
- Maybe she doesn't feel like

1187
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,133
she deserves to be here.

1188
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,500
- Right.

1189
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,667
- And if you don't believe it,
nobody else will.

1190
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,467
- Moving on to Phi Phi O'Hara

1191
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,166
and<i> Sashay Away</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>

1192
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,633
This looked like the most

1193
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:35,300
professional magazine of
the whole bunch.

1194
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,567
- It did, but as we're going

1195
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:37,667
through all of these I'm

1196
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,600
wondering did it look like

1197
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,867
the most professional because

1198
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,600
everything else was so bad?

1199
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,867
- [laughs]

1200
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,500
- I had a problem with the fact
that she wore

1201
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,066
a blonde cap with
blonde hair.

1202
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:49,200
She looked like she had a dead
baby lamb on her head.

1203
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,667
- And who wants that?
- Nobody.

1204
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,667
- Sharon Needles.
- There'd be blood coming out.

1205
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,166
- Silence!

1206
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,066
I've made my decision.

1207
00:38:57,066 --> 00:39:01,066
Bring back my girls.

1208
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Welcome back, ladies.

1209
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,367
Based on your dragazines and

1210
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,066
your presentations on the main

1211
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,533
stage, I've made some decisions.

1212
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,133
[suspenseful music]

1213
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,700
Phi Phi O'Hara, your travel

1214
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,066
dragazine was a real trip.

1215
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,800
And we're excited that you keep

1216
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,433
taking us to new places.

1217
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,066
You are the winner of this

1218
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,700
week's challenge.

1219
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,967
[applause]

1220
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,433
- Ah, thank God.

1221
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,400
- You've won a cruise to

1222
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,834
the Bahamas courtesy of

1223
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,567
alandchuck.travel.

1224
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,066
- Oh, man.

1225
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,867
[laughs]

1226
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,667
Oh, finally.

1227
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,066
This is my first win, and I'm

1228
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,667
really excited because it's nice

1229
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,433
to know that my hard work has
paid off.

1230
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:50,967
Those girls better watch out.

1231
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,567
- Sharon Needles, you're safe.

1232
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,100
Dida Ritz...

1233
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,934
you're safe.

1234
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,400
- Thank you.

1235
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,533
- Chad Michaels.

1236
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,600
- Yes, ma'am?

1237
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,467
- This week the judges were not

1238
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,000
gagging on your<i> Eleganza.</i>

1239
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,633
You...

1240
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:18,600
are safe.

1241
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,867
- [exhales]

1242
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:23,100
Thank you.

1243
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,700
- Jiggly Caliente, once again

1244
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,800
you left us hungry for more.

1245
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,633
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are

1246
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,233
up for elimination.

1247
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,800
- Again?
Seriously?

1248
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,600
That's just straight-up jank.

1249
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,033
- Latrice Royale...

1250
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,433
you're safe.

1251
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,934
Willam, I'm sorry, my dear,

1252
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:57,600
but you are up for elimination.

1253
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,700
- When Ru tells me about being

1254
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,834
in the bottom two,
I feel shaken,

1255
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,233
and it's a little scary.

1256
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:05,266
- Two queens stand before me.

1257
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,700
Prior to tonight you were asked

1258
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,066
to prepare a lip sync

1259
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,400
performance of<i> Mi Vida Loca</i>

1260
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,667
by Pam Tillis.

1261
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,567
Ladies, this is your last chance

1264
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,834

1266

my mom would be so proud of me.

1319
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,100
I fucking fought my way.

1320
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,767
And it just didn't happen.

1321
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,567
But life goes on.

yourself how in the hell are you

1328
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:06,567
gonna love somebody else?

1329
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:07,934
Can I get an amen up in here?

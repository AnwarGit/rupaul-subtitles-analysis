-<i>Flazéda</i>, it's a new hashtag.

-[RuPaul] Well, <i>flazéda</i>.
-How you spell that?

331
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,586
She done already done has herses.
Is that correct?

332
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:45,724
She done already done had herses.
What does "herses" mean?

333
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,960
Um, okay. I was coming from the club.

334
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,596
And I went to Krystal Burger
in Atlanta, Georgia.

335
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:55,067
And we would go and get our food on after,
you know, partying and everything.

336
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,506
Somebody had come up to pick up a bag,
but it actually didn't belong to them.

337
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:04,209
And this girl behind the counter said,

338
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,247
"Uh-uh, no, no, no.
She done already done had herses."

339
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,350
And of course, I've, you know...

340
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,686
taken that to the bank.

341
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,126

[Mel] I'm not that young.
I'm 39. I was like, shit.

354
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,604
So Victoria was
the first one who turned 40?

355
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:10,776
[Mel] Geri. But then again,
nobody really knows how old Geri is.

356
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,178
She holds that passport so tight.

357
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,846
How dare you, Michelle?

358
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,717
She comes out here in crutches
with some Amadeus realness, right...

359
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,220
Darling, it's always the same silhouette.

360
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,556
You can throw crutches on it,
still the same silhouette.

361
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:29,561
-That silhouette with the powdered wig--
-Snatch waist. The same thing.

362
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,897
No dessert for either of you tonight.

Poop is natural. Everybody poops.

[Demi] I don't.

365
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,571
Ever.

366
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,207
This season, the fashion was on fleek.

367
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:47,112
But in a season of killer looks,
which bitch wore it best?

368
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:52,217
Let's hear from Raja and Raven
on how to look like a winner, baby.

369
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,524
{\an8}We're talking about our favorite looks
of season seven of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

370
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,729
And one that we didn't quite... get.

371
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:11,169
One of my top picks was Miss Kennedy
in her leather and lace gown.

372
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,273
[Raja] <i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Very Kennedy. Very LaGuardia.</i>

373
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,775
Probably more Newark, but still cute.

374
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,912
Here's my first favorite.
Katya in the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.

375
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,217
I always love a bit of a sight gag.
It's like the banana peel in comedy.

376
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,854
<i>If I were in that challenge,</i>
<i>I would've done something more glamorous.</i>

377
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,826
Asphyxiation via a fabulous silk scarf
from a floating chandelier above me.

378
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,562
And then I would sing
"Chandelier" by Sia.

379
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,398
Cue music. Oh, no, we can't afford it.

380
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:46,338
My next look was Violet Chachki
in her Hello Kitty extravaganza.

381
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,709
<i>Other-worldly, very reminiscent</i>
<i>of Hello Kitty herself.</i>

382
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,247
Isn't Uranus the planet
with the ring around it?

383
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,617
-No.
-That's Jupiter.

384
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,587
-[Raven] <i>Now, let's talk about RuPaul.</i>
-[Raja] <i>The goddess herself.</i>

385
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:08,727
My favorite was the black velvet dress
painting of herself with the white afro.

386
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:13,699
[Raven] <i>Honey, this look featured</i>
<i>naked RuPaul riding a black panther.</i>

387
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,200
-It was different.
-Yeah.

388
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,869
She never brings
anything up around the neck.

389
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,373
Maybe she just had a hairy chest that day.
Whatever. She looks great.

390
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,142
I love this look. Yes, God.

391
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,214
Now, my least favorite look
from the entire season

392
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:33,151
had to be Kennedy's look
for the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.

393
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,420
-What was that?
-A huge WTF.

394
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,323
[Raja] <i>#chickenorwhat, remember that?</i>

395
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,959
Her explanation of the outfit
did not make sense.

396
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,363
Something about being a hooker
and a phoenix rising and...

397
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,631
-Crystallize.
-Oh, my God.

398
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,102
She just looks like a crystal meth addict
in Phoenix, Arizona.

399
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,372
-Can we go to break?
-No.

400
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,677
The biggest prize of all is still to come.

I feel like they bitchy-osed this season.

412
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:42,320
{\an8}What contestant that young goes on
a reality show competition like RuPaul's,

413
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,724
which is a lot of work,
and says, "I hate the main judge"?

414
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,225

416
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,130
She probably has a bigger man-body
than I do without her implants.

She let them have it after that challenge.

453

Be prepared.

-We didn't have time to re-rehearse...
-Make it work. Make it work.

455
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,844
If Ru yelled at me like that,
I would have just cried.

456

00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,346
where they produce winners
like Pandora Boxx and Darienne Lake.

478
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,282
-What?
-There's no talent in the water.

479
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,752
-Trixie Mattel.
-So...

480
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,889
It was really so sad to see Trixie go.
Twice. Ha-ha!

481
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,025
<i>Max.</i>

482
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,294
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.

483
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,498
Max is always complaining
that drag queens are too vulgar.

484
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,267
You know what's vulgar?
That fucking accent, bitch.

485
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,903
And that brings us to Miss Fame.

486
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,075
I'm hitting a wall, and I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.

487
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,211
Her personality is so amazing
that, growing up,

488
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,480
her only friends were chickens.

489
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,416
Some people would say I love cock.

490
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,520
Ca-caw! And then there's
our distinguished top three.

491
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,323
Ginger Minj claims to be the glamor toad,
but when you look at her,

492
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,392
she's been eating more than flies.

493
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,500
Pearl. The best thing about Pearl's drag?

494
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,469
She's cute as a boy.

495
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,072
[Bianca] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>

496
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,040
[Michelle] <i>Her waist is so small!</i>

497
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,911
I was really shocked when I saw
Violet come out with that oxygen tank.

498
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,980
-'Cause that meant Ru wasn't using it.
-Bitch!

499
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,085
-And who can forget Michelle Visage?
-Mmm...

500
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,288
She's constantly saying that,
"RuPaul is my best friend."

501
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,957
Funny thing is you don't hear Ru say it.

502
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,395
The opinions expressed
by Bianca Del Rio do not represent

503
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,965
{\an8}those of RuPaul's Race,
Logo TV, World of Wonder,

504
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:57,969
{\an8}the NAACP, or the Friends
of the Pacoima Public Library.

505
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,172
Except the part about Michelle Visage.

506
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,774
I kind of agree with that one.

507
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:08,980
Now, our top three queens,
Pearl, Ginger Minj, and Violet Chachki,

508
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,249
have each made it this far

509
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,052
thanks to a certain thing
we call <i>je ne sais quoi</i>,

510
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,689
which in French means
"their pussies are on fire."

511
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:25,063
{\an8}-Hi, fellas.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger, a plus-size powerhouse,</i>

512
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,633
<i>a killer comedian,</i>
<i>and a natural-born performer.</i>

513
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,802
{\an8}-I love you, Justin Bieber.
-[laughs]

514
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,073
Ginger can serve up some strong tea...

515
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,443
We don't mean any harm, girl.
Except when we do.

516
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,079
And still leave you gagging for more.

517
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,016
{\an8}Ginger Minj for the crown.
This girl has it all.

518
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:49,554
{\an8}She can sing, act, dance...
Nope, not so much dance.

519
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,989
Boom, boom, boom.

520
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:55,927
{\an8}She is confident, funny,
and she just looks like she smells good.

521
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,596
Pearl, your razor burn is so bad

522
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,100
the only way I can read you is by braille.

523
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:06,704
She can read a bitch for filth
with a beating heart underneath it all.

524
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,707
I can't believe I'm crying on fucking TV.

525
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,411
What Ginger has that no one else has

526
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,114
<i> is that extra...</i>

527
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,949
fifty pounds.

528
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,617
{\an8}[laughs]

529
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,055
{\an8}I cannot wait to see
a big girl win <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

530
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:28,359
{\an8}I always thought Jinkx Monsoon
was the first plus-sized winner.

531
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,429
This season,
Ginger accomplished the impossible.

532
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,532
<i>She got gay men everywhere screaming...</i>

533
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,768
I love the minj.

534
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,138
[RuPaul] <i>But does Ginger</i>
<i>have the right amount of sugar, spice,</i>

535
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,374
<i>and show-stopping skills</i>
<i>to snatch the crown?</i>

536
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,710
In one week, all will be revealed.

537
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,747
{\an8}<i>Next up, a precious gem</i>

538
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:53,151
{\an8}<i>who took her own sweet time</i>
<i>to come out of her shell.</i>

539
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,453
{\an8}-'Sup?
-<i>But once she did...</i>

540
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,189
-she sparkled.
-Thank you.

541
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,459
-Pearl.
-Pearl is beautiful.

542
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,596
This porcelain mug.
You can't mess with that.

543
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,266
Pearl has
a very New York approach to drag.

544
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,903
She always puts
that high-fashion twist on it.

545
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,772
Bitch, you can wear fur in spring, okay?

546
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,811
I mean, Pearl's hot. As a boy, goddamn it,
she can get me pregnant.

547
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,045
Totally. I'll raise it.

548
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:28,653
I think the turning point for Pearl
was she started listening to the judges.

549
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,723
And she, like, took her Adderall.

550
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,762
It's neat to see
vulnerability come out of Pearl.

551
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,665
I didn't know that tears
came out of them sleepy eyes.

552
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,736
What would Pearl
have to say to little Matthew?

553
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,140
You're going to enter
the toughest years of your life.

554
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,144
It makes you want to hug her.
And everybody grows.

555
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,179
I mean, she's growing. She grew!

556
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,381
You're a star, baby.

557
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,651
I love her.

558
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,620
Sleeper queen Pearl had the tenacity

559
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,890
<i>to rise and shine her way to the top.</i>

560
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:10,194
<i>Her attitude and edgy looks</i>
<i>have fascinated the nation,</i>

561
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:15,033
leading many to believe
the jewel in the crown will be a Pearl.

562
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,367
Yeah!

563
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:21,005
{\an8}Uh-oh. Ooh, la, la, la, la, la.

564
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,974
-Last...
-Yay!

565
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,909
But by no means least...

566
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,879
<i>She's young, beautiful, and outspoken.</i>

567
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,547
That's right.

568
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,418
With a sophisticated knowledge of fashion
well beyond her years.

569
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,889
<i>When it comes to style,</i>
<i>she just might have this competition</i>

570
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,590
<i>all cinched up.</i>

571
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,926
This is Violet Chachki.

572
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,898
I love her style. She has a great eye.
She does a beautiful makeup.

573
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,436
Violet should win based purely
on the fact that she had a black thing

574
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,172
and took off the belt,
and it turned into a plaid thing.

575
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,642
Oh, that look was everything.

576
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,678
{\an8}-Miss Thing.
-[tongue pops]

577
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,081
{\an8}That ho's been reading some magazines.

578
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,450
The internet happened.
Have you heard of it?

579
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,851
Oh!

580
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,186
Violet is a bitch.

581
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,556
I don't trust a drag queen that isn't one.

582
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,391
[Violet] <i>People think I'm mean,</i>

583
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,995
but everything I've done comes
from a place of humor or a place of truth.

584
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,464
She's not bad.
She's just painted that way.

585
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,835
I want you to know that I'm going
to be working on the way I come across.

586
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,537
She's like Courtney,
you got to get to know her

587
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,307
to know that there's no malice.

588
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,510
-You have something that I don't have.
-Beauty?

589
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:38,216
She's still a bitch,
but she's a bitch with a heart of gold.

590
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,184
Like Bianca Del Rio.

591
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,222
Violet evolved
from a fiery-tempered fashionista...

592
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,258
-What?
-<i>To a glamazon with grace.</i>

593
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,128
<i>But in a race</i>
<i>that's tighter than her corset,</i>

594
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,232
can Violet snatch the crown officially?

595
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,300
Come through!

596
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,470
There you have it. Your top three queens.

597
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:04,675
But which one of these cover girls
will be America's next drag superstar?

598
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,946
{\an8}It's anybody's guess.
Are you Team Ginger Minj?

599
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,884
{\an8}<i>Team Pearl? Or Team Violet Chachki?</i>

600
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,420
{\an8}<i>Hashtag it now and tell the world.</i>

601
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:19,123
It's your chance to break the Internet.

602
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,662
Who do you want to snatch the title
of America's next drag superstar?

603
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,697
<i>Are you Team Ginger,</i>

604
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,166
<i>Team Pearl,</i>

605
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,668
<i>or Team Violet Chachki?</i>

606
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,239
And one week from tonight,
I'm reserving you a front-row seat

607
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,643
<i>to the grand finale of</i> RuPaul's Drag Race<i>.</i>

608
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,913
All right, girlfriends. Loosen your tuck.

609
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,415
Let it all hang out

610
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,686
for the world premiere
of <i>Born Naked: The Music Video.</i>

611
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,123
And remember,
if you can't love yourself naked,

612
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,226
how the hell you going to love
somebody else naked?

613
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,928
Can I get an amen up in here?

614
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,729
[all] Amen.

615
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,666

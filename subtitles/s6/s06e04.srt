IN FRONT OF YOU WHILE
YOU'RE BUTCHERING THE LYRICS.

349
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,934
- I KNOW THAT ALL THOSE WORDS,
THAT'S A LOT.

350
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,300
YOU HAVE TO GET
ALL THAT DOWN,

351
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,266
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET LOST,

352
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
IT IMMEDIATELY SHOWS
IN YOUR EYES.

353
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,367
- I KNOW.
- YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.

354
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,367
- THIS IS THE CHANCE, BASICALLY,
FOR ME TO PROVE MYSELF,

355
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
SO, I GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.

356
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,867
- ♪ AND FINALLY, I'M THE STAR ♪

357
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,834
- ♪ NO, I'M THE STAR ♪

358

[GIGGLES]

360
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,266
- YOU HAVE A VERY UNIQUE TONE
TO YOUR VOICE.

361
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,934
- I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT.

362
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,400
I LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE
A RATHER DISTINCTIVE VOICE.

363
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,033
[LAUGHS]
I'VE EMBRACED IT.

364
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,433
- 2, 3, 4.

365
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,800
- ♪ WELL, I'M NOT GOING

366

367
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,767
- OKAY, STOP FOR ONE SECOND.

368
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,934
THAT SORT OF RHYTHMIC
TALK-SINGING

369
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:09,734
THAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
IS NOT COMING OFF THAT GREAT.

370
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,266
- AY, DIOS MIO.

371
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,100

375
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,433
- WELL, YOU JUST

376
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,700
- I NEED TO PROVE
THAT I CAN PULL THIS

377
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,333
FOR ME AND FOR MY TEAM,

378
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:34,600
SO, I CAN'T BE
A DOWNWARD DEBBIE--

379
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER NAME IS.

380
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:39,400
- SHOWGIRLS,
YOUR ACT IS GOING TO BE

381
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,667
THE SINK-OR-SWIM THING
OF THIS WHOLE TEAM.

382
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
- THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.

383
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,133
LIKE, ONE PERSON'S OFF,

384
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,867
WE ALL FALL LIKE DOMINOES.

385
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:54,166
- TRINITY IS DEFINITELY
NOT 100% HERE,

386
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,233
IS SHE FRUSTRATED SEXUALLY?

387
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,967
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT GUESS WHAT?

388
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,767
WE HAVE ABOUT THIS MUCH TIME
AND ABOUT THIS MUCH WORK TO DO,

389
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,633
SO, BITCH, GET INTO IT.

390
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:08,033
- ALL RIGHT, FROM THE TOP.

391
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:08,967
- TURN AROUND.

392
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,367
- NO, YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, MISSY.

393
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,333
BOOM.

394
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,533
- I'M YOU.

395
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,633
DO YOU SEE THE DIFFICULTNESS
IN DOING IT BACKWARDS

396
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,600
AND THEN TRYING TO TURN AROUND
AT THE SAME TIME?

397
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,934
IT'S REALLY, REALLY FAST.

398
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,967
- SHE HAS TO BE HERE.
- IT TOOK YOU TOO LONG TO MOVE,

399
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,700
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HIT IT.

400
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,166
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO--
- CONSIDERING THIS HAS BEEN

401
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,400
YOUR PROBLEM AREA,
TAKE A SECOND AND CALM DOWN.

402
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,767
I WALK TO HER,

403
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,633
AND I SAY "TURN AROUND."

404
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,633
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

405
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,100
PRIOR TO TELLING ME
WHAT I'M NOT DOING RIGHT.

406
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,133
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
BIANCA,

407
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,166
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

408
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,467
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BITCH.

409
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,900
- I APOLOGIZE THAT I OPENED
MY MOUTH, AND THAT'S WHY

410
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,233
I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

411
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,633
- COVER GIRL,

412
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,500
PUT THAT BASS IN YOUR WALK,
COME ON!

413
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,967
- COME ON, GIRL.

414
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,033
- TODAY, ON THE MAIN STAGE,

415
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,166
OUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS TONY AWARDS GLAMOUR,

416
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,800
AND WE'RE PERFORMING
IN "SHADE, THE RUSICAL."

417
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,567
WE HAVE TO SING LIVE,

418
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,734
ALTHOUGH YOU'VE SEEN

419
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,100
SOME OF THE PEOPLE
IN MY GROUP.

420
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,233
- YOU READY TO SERVE
SOME PAGEANT REALNESS OUT THERE?

421
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,633
- YES, GOD, BITCH, UGH.
- OKAY?

422
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,533
- I'M GOING TO GET ME
A TONY TONIGHT.

423
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,100
- WHAT'S A TONY?

424
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,533
- SO, YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AMERICAN.

425
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:18,767
- YES.

426
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,867
AND YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AUSTRALIAN.

427
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,033
- I WAS.

428
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:25,100
I WENT ALONG
THE FIRST DAY AS A BOY

429
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,367
AND I GOT KNOCKED BACK,

430
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,567
AND SO THEN I WENT BACK
THE NEXT DAY IN DRAG,

431
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,934
AND I MADE IT THROUGH
TO THE FINALS.

432
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:33,300
- HOLY CRAP.
- I WAS THE FIRST OUT GAY PERSON

433
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,867
AND THE FIRST PERSON IN DRAG

434
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,333
TO BE ON ANY IDOL FRANCHISE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

435
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,066
- I WISH I COULD'VE DID THAT.

436
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,567
- YEAH, BUT ADORE,
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE

437
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,500
YOU WERE SORT OF
THE AMERICAN COUNTERPART OF,

438
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:46,166
LIKE, THE FIRST REAL SORT OF
GAY PERSON ON "AMERICAN IDOL?"

439
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,300
- YEAH, BUT I WAS
KIND OF ADVISED

440
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,300
TO JUST NOT BE SO OUT THERE.

441
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,800
- SO, YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO, LIKE,
KIND OF KEEP YOURSELF--

442
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,900
- TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE.
- YEAH.

443
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:57,066
- RIGHT.
- SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T LIKING IT.

444
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,133
- MY MOM TOLD ME TO BUTCH IT UP

445
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,000
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM
MAKING FUN OF ME.

446
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,033
SHE SHOULD'VE JUST LET ME
GO OUT THERE WITH PINK HAIR.

447
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,400
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL.

448
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,233
- GIA, WHAT WERE SOME
OF YOUR TALENTS AS A CHILD

449
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,166
BESIDES TUCKING YOUR WEENIE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

450
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,166
[LAUGHTER]

451
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,300
- I ACTUALLY WAS DOING

452
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,533
THE DANCE FORM OF KABUKI THEATER

453
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,667
SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD.

454
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,100
IN JAPAN, KABUKI THEATER
IS ALL MEN,

455
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,967
BUT WE WOULDN'T, LIKE, GET
TUCKED AND, LIKE, PUT BOOBS ON

456
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

457
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,567
IN MY CULTURE,
IT'S NOT A GAY THING,

458
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
SO EVEN STRAIGHT MEN DO IT.

459
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,467
IT'S AN ART.

460
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,233
THIS IS LIKE WHEN I WOULD DO,
LIKE, THE BOY ROLES.

461
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,800
AND THIS IS ONE I WOULD DO
THE FISH ROLE.

462
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,100
- NO WAY!
- LOOKING GOOD.

463
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,734
- WITH MY THEATER BACKGROUND
IN KABUKI,

464
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,934
I DEFINITELY HAVE
A GOOD SENSE

465
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,567
OF STAGE PRESENCE
AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY,

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,834
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

467
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,700
I'M REALLY HOPING
FOR THE BEST,

468
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:55,734

I LIKE THE WAY THE GOWN
ACCENTUATES YOUR HIPLINE.

695
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,200
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,

696
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,066
BUT I'M NOT ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

697
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,233
IT'S KIND OF
A MUSH-MOUTH THING.

698
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,533
WE HEARD BIANCA,

699
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,133
AND THEN WE'D LOSE
YOUR LINE.

700
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,333
- IT'S ALL
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

701
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,166
- YES, YES, BUT YOU ARE
IN THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG.

702
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,567
- BUT EVERY STAR WAS CRAP
BEFORE THEY BECAME THE SHIT.

703
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,100
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

704
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,633
PUT A CORK IN IT.

705
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,233
LITERALLY,

706
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,867
GET A CORK,
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH,

707
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,867
SPEAK WITH THAT CORK
IN THE MOUTH.

708
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,066
IT WILL DO WONDERS
FOR ENUNCIATION.

709
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,900
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE.

710
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:52,567
- LOOK AT YOU ALL PRETTY
IN YOUR POND SCUM GREEN.

711
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,667
- [LAUGHS]
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

712
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,600
- AS FAR AS
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN GOES,

713
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,266
YOU GOT A LITTLE LOST.

714
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,166
- IT IS A LITTLE HARD
TO KIND OF CONTINUE ON

715
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,367
WITH A FIRE SIREN
BEING SQUASHED IN YOUR EAR.

716
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,934
- THAT'S GIA
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?

717
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:10,200
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

718
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,400
- WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S SAFE AND YOU'RE HERE?

719
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:16,100
- 'CAUSE I THINK
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 3?

720
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:19,000
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.

721
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,266
BENDELACREME.

722
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,767
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

723
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,667
I BELIEVE THAT LESS
IS ALWAYS BEST.

724
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,633
LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

725
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:28,834
TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF SOMETHING AWAY.

726
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,600
- OH!
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

727
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,467
NOW, YOU ARE WORKING IT.

728
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,

729
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,834
BUT I FELT THAT
YOU COULD'VE TAKEN IT FURTHER.

730
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,934
- I LOVED YOUR PORTRAYAL
OF THE VILLAIN,

731
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,133
LOVED YOUR EVIL
BETTIE PAGE LOOK,

732
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,300
AND YOUR VOICE, TOO.

733
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,967
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

734
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,133
- UP NEXT, COURTNEY ACT.

735
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,600
- THE ILLUSION
IS WORKING FOR ME.

736
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:51,000
A-MA-ZING.

737
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,700
AND YOU CAN REALLY SING.

738
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,100
FABULOUS.

739
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:56,934
- YOU ARE A STAR.

740
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,433
- THANK YOU.
- BUT I WAS ACTUALLY

741
00:29:58,467 --> 00:29:59,967
REALLY NERVOUS IN REHEARSALS,

742
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
BECAUSE YOU WERE
MISSING CUES.

743
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,200
- I WAS MUFFLING TWO WORDS,

744
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:09,166
BUT I NAILED IT ON THE NIGHT.

745
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,734
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.

746
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,600
- TONIGHT, THE DRESS,
FOR ME, COULD BE LONGER.

747
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,033
IT COULD GO TO THE FLOOR.

748
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,333
- WHY IS YOUR WAIST
NOT CINCHED

749
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,600
WHEN I JUST TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT THIS?

750
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,333
- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE, LIKE,
A "CINCHER" CINCHER, ONLY--

751
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,967
- BORROW A WAIST CINCHER
AND GIVE ME THE SILHOUETTE

752
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,700
I NEED FROM YOU,
ADORE DELANO.

753
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,767
- I'M A BETTER DRAG QUEEN
THAN I'M COMING OFF, I SWEAR.

754
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,200
- [LAUGHS]
- I LOVED YOUR VOICE.

755
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,233
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULD COMPETE

756
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,600
IN "AMERICAN IDOL."

757
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,900
- I DID.
- SEE THAT?

758
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,433
I GOT THAT IMMEDIATELY.

759
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:40,767
- PARTY.
- HA!

760
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,367
PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]

761
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,333
- NEXT UP, APRIL CARRION.

762
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:48,667
- WELL, YOUR FACE
IS ALWAYS BEAT FOR THE GODS,

763
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,567
BUT I THINK YOUR SHADING'S
A LITTLE DARK

764
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,800
TOWARDS YOUR HAIRLINE.

765
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,967
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE
A BEARD ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

766
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,433
- APRIL, I KNOW YOU TRIED

767
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,400
REALLY, REALLY HARD
ON THIS CHALLENGE,

768
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,433
BUT YOU WERE WAY OFF.

769
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:05,767
- BEING THE BIG GIRL,
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SIZE.

770
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,433
IT'S MORE OF AN ATTITUDE,

771
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,000
AND YOU DIDN'T DELIVER
THE ATTITUDE.

772
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,233
YOU PUT SOME PADDING IN
AND THOUGHT

773
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:14,533
THAT IT WOULD TRANSLATE,
AND IT DIDN'T.

774
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:15,734
- THANK YOU, LADIES.

775
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,734
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,

776
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,633
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

777
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,100
ALL RIGHT, NOW, JUST BETWEEN US,
DREAM GIRLS.

778
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,066
- HMM.

779
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,467
- LET'S TALK OFF-BROADWAY.

780
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,233
LET'S START WITH
TRINITY K. BONET.

781
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,533
- DICTION, DICTION, I WANT
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING!

782
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:36,000
- NOW, WHEN TRINITY'S IN DRAG,
SHE WEARS TEMPORARY TEETH.

783
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,834
WE CALL THEM FLIPPERS
IN THE BUSINESS.

784
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,200
I'M WONDERING,
COULD THAT BE THE REASON

785
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,000
SHE'S UNABLE
TO PRONOUNCE HER LYRICS?

786
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,367
- FLIPPER OR NO FLIPPER,

787
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,133
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

788
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,166
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YES.

789
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,467
- AND BE OPEN
TO LISTENING TO SOMEBODY.

790
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
ALL "UGH" FACE.

791
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,967
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME
FOR THAT.

792
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,233
[LAUGHTER]

793
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,500
- DARIENNE LAKE.

794
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,734
- SHE SEEMED TO GET
A LITTLE BIT

795
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,834
LOST IN THE SAUCE,
WHEREAS GIA,

796
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,600
FOGHORN OR NOT,

797
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,166
WAS GIVING IT ALL
WITH EASE.

798
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,100
DARIENNE DISAPPEARED
FOR ME.

799
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,266
- THE THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT.

800
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,567
- I INSTANTLY WAS TRANSPORTED
INTO A BROADWAY HOUSE.

801
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
- YES.
- AND I TOTALLY BOUGHT IT

802
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:18,400
FROM HEAD TO TOE,

803
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,767
BUT THERE WERE SOME CLUNKERS
THAT SHE HIT.

804
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,734
- I DIDN'T REALLY MIND
ANY OF THE NOTES

805
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,333
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A LITTLE OFF.

806
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,667
SHE REALLY NAILED
THIS PERFORMANCE.

807
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,734
- I LOVED THAT
FRESH-FROM-KANSAS,

808
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,934
FRESH-OFF-THE-BUS
LOOK OF HERS.

809
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,433
SHE WAS FABULOUS.

810
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,633
- BENDELACREME.

811
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,967
- KNEW THE CHOREOGRAPHY,
KNEW ALL THE WORDS,

812
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,500
LOOKED GOOD DOING IT.

813
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:40,200
- I REALLY LOVE
HER BODY LANGUAGE, AS WELL.

814
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,667
- YOU CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT HER,

815
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,633
THIS IS HER SHTICK.

816
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:43,633
- YEAH.
-BUT SHE ONLY TOOK IT

817
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,300
HALFWAY TO TONI BRAXTON.
- [LAUGHS]

818
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,333
- SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY.

819
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,633
- ADORE DELANO.

820
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,500
- ADORE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE,

821
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,867
BUT SHE CAN BE A LITTLE SLOPPY.

822
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,233
- ADORE WAS THE MVP FOR ME.

823
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,367
HER VOICE AND THE TONES

824
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
THAT WERE COMING OUT
OF HER MOUTH

825
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,900
MADE ME LOOK AT HER
IN A WHOLE OTHER LIGHT

826
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:04,000
OF BEING LIKE,
WOW, THIS IS A REAL TALENT.

827
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,900
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
APRIL CARRION.

828
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:10,166
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE TRIED REALLY HARD.

829
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,233
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE DID NOT
EMBODY THE BIG GIRL ROLE.

830
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,734
- WELL, THAT'S THE STANDOUT
ROLE OF THAT TRIO.

831
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:18,567
- YES, IT IS.
- AND IT HAS TO DELIVER.

832
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,533
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

833
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,734
- SILENCE,

834
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:25,033
I'VE MADE MY DECISION,
GUYS AND DOLLS.

835
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,133
NOW, BRING BACK MY GIRLS.

836
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,033
[LAUGHS]

837
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,033
- [LAUGHS]

838
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,633
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

839
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,834
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.

840
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,333
THE NOMINEES
FOR BEST ACTRESS

841
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,633
IN A RUSICAL ARE...

842
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:48,300
COURTNEY ACT
AS GOOD PENNY,

843
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:52,033
BENDELACREME
AS SHADY LADY,

844
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:57,100
ADORE DELANO
AS BAD PENNY.

845
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,700
MAY I HAVE
THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?

846
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,700
THE WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE IS...

847
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,266
COURTNEY ACT.

848
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,567
- THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

849
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,934
AND THANK YOU.

850
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,200
- YOU'VE WON
TWO VIP PACKAGES

851
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:23,166
FOR THE TONY-WINNING
BROADWAY MUSICAL

852
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
"KINKY BOOTS."

853
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:25,700
- OOH!

854
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,767
- LADIES, YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.

855
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:37,300
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN ROUTINE

856
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,834
DIDN'T REALLY SHTICK
WITH THE JUDGES.

857
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:44,867
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOUR PAGEANT QUEEN PERFORMANCE

858
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,266
WAS NOT YOUR CROWNING GLORY.

859
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,834
APRIL CARRION,
IN THE ROLE OF THE BIG GIRL,

860
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:56,367
YOU MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF
MORE THAN YOU COULD CHEW.

861
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
DARIENNE LAKE,

862
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:02,567
YOU ARE SAFE.

863
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,467
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.

864
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,400

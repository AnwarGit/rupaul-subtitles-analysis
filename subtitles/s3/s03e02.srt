13
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,600
Prepare to die!

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,633

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,233

00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,533

I'm 34 years old, and I'm
from Norwalk, California.

43
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,133
There's gonna be a good half
the people watching

44
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,333
that think that a big girl
can't win this competition.

45
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,867
But if you can't get past that,

46
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,900
then you're not gonna get into
everything I have to offer.

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,266
I'm here not just to represent
the big girls.

48
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:21,066
I wanna follow in RuPaul's
footsteps.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,567
- My name is Christopher Ulman,

50
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:29,300
also known as Carmen Carrera.

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,967
I am 25 years old
from New Jersey.

00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,700
- [laughing]
- Body!

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,333
- Carmen Carrera is, like, the
flyest girl

00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,667
you're gonna ever meet
in your life.

56
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,300
I make sure that her body is
flawless.

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,567
If you find a flaw, let me know.

58
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,967
- Hi!
- Hi.

59
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,066
- What's goin' on?

60
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,066
- Oh, look at your shoes.

61
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,700
I love them!
- Oh, those are rad.

62
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,867
- Fierce, honey, fierce.

63
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,633
My name is Phoenix.
I'm 29 years old.

64
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.

65
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,467
Yay, craziness.

66
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,834
When I walk in, I want people to
be like, okay...

67
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,700
she could be a handful.

68
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
I can play well with others.

69
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,834
My mom raised me well.

70
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,066
But I definitely do have a
bitchy side.

71
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,166
- [falsetto] Hello!

72
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,433
- Well, hel-lo!

73
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,600
- Manila!

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,533
- Hi! Oh, my God, look at you!

75
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,166
I'm Manila Luzon.

76
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:22,066
I am a creative little kid from
the Midwest whose creativity was

77
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,567
too big for Minnesota.

78
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,100
So I moved to New York City.

79
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,934
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

80
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,734
I love Manila.

81
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,333
I know her from working
in New York.

82
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,467
- This is the most clothes I
have seen you ever in.

83
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:34,467
- I know.

84
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,066
- Always buck naked.

85
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:39,367
My drag persona Manila is my
personal muse because...

86
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,066
I inspire myself.

87
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,166
[laughs]

88
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,767
- Hi!

89
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,967
- Hi.

90
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:49,800
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.

91
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,567
I'm 25 years old, and I'm from
Back Swamp, North Carolina.

92
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm very much so
a country queen.

93
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,266
I live on a dirt road surrounded
by corn fields.

94
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,166
Can't get more country than
that.

95
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,200
- We got two of y'all tonight.

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
- Okay.
- Yes, honey.

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,433
- Being a plus-size queen living
in a drag community

98
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,133
that's so vicious--
it's so vicious--

99
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,800
it's built me up to be who I am.

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,367
- The weather girls are here.

101
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,467
- Say, word.

102
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,333
[door opens]

103
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,500

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,433
all: Hi!

105
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,433
- My name is Adam,
AKA Venus D-Lite.

106
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm 26 years old, and I live
in Los Angeles.

107
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
- Hi, Venus!

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,834
- Hey, what's going on?

109
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,300
Hi, baby.

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,200
Venus's female role models are
Madonna, of course,

111
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,233
Grace Jones, Barbra Streisand,
and Jean Harlow.

112
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,500
She's just a blond bombshell
ditzy bimbo.

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,734
- Hi.

114
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:38,700
- Hi.

115
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,066
- I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm 26.

116
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm from Puerto Rico.

117
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,533
I'm the Puerto Rican one, so...

118
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,266
- So? I'm the Asian.
- And what about you?

119
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,800
- From L.A., I'm Italian.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,633
- I'm from L.A., also.
I'm black.

121
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,900
[laughter]

122
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,734
- Everybody knows who is
Yara Sofia in Puerto Rico.

123
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,367
I mean, if you don't, I'm sorry,

124
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:59,467
darling, this is not your world.

125
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,166
- Hey!

126
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,300
all: Hey!

127
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,433
- I am Mariah Balenciaga,
AKA Mariah Paris,

128
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,533
AKA Mariah Successful.

129
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,867
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I am 29 years old.

130
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,300
I know you.

131
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
- Good to see you, baby.

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,834
- Mariah tends to be the center
of the party.

133
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,467
I mean, you cannot miss her.

134
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,567
A 6'2" glamazon walking through

135
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,700
the middle of the room with legs
like a racehorse.

136
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,667
- Y'all got things worked
in yet?

137
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,734
- No, we're just kinda waiting
around for all the girls to come

138
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,734
so we can judge them.

139
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,900
- Oh. There's more?

140
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,066
I've dominated and conquered

141
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:32,433
drag's face
for the past 11 years.

142
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:37,066
There's really nobody who can
touch Mariah.

143
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,200
- Hey, hey, hey!

144
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,767
all: Hi!

145
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,400
- How's everybody doing?

146
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,333
My name is Alexis Mateo.
I'm 30 years old.

147
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,333
Everybody's having fun?

148
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,333
all: Yes.

149
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,633
- [giggles]

150
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,133
- Are you from Texas?

151
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,967
- I'm living in Florida right
now--I'm from Puerto Rico.

152
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,667
- Oh, see, double down!

153
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:56,567
We got two big girls,
we got two Puerto Ricans.

154
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,967
- What I hate the most is that

155
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,066
people label you
as the Latin queen.

156
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,867
I'm not just a Latin queen.

157
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:05,233
When I'm in drag, I'm a star.

158
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,533
- Oh!

159
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:17,066
- Ooh.

160
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,066
Oh, my.

161
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,166
It's embarrassing to walk in

162
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,333
with a room with a whole bunch
of queens,

163
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,166
and you guys are wearing
the same outfit.

164
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,734
- I was like, oh, my gosh.

165
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:27,734
I know they are gasping
for breath right now.

166
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,400
- I'm India Ferrah.

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,467
I'm from Dayton, Ohio.

168
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,233
I'm 23 years old.

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,867
Girl, prison, honey.

170
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,100
I look over to Phoenix copying
my style.

171
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,467
So I actually had to go up to
her and,

172
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,900
you know, be a little cunt
to her.

173
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,200
I love your hair.

174
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
[laughter]

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
- I'm definitely wearing the
hair better, the vinyl better.

176
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,233
India's very, like...painted.

177
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,166
She's very, like,
old-school drag.

178
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,200
But it's cool.

179
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,333
It's cool to see, like,

180
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,233
that style of drag still
amongst us, so...

181
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,934
- Have we figured out who's
gonna be the bitch yet?

182
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:04,934
- Ooh!

183
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,767
[murmuring]

184
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,333
- Welcome to my party!

185
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,300
all: Hi!

186
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,166
- Oh, my gosh!

187
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,300
I brought cookies.

188
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,467
I'm Mimi Imfurst.

189
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,266
I'm 27,
and I'm from New York City.

190
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,700
How y'all doing?

191
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,500
I just want to start off on good
terms with all these bitches

192
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,834
before I start taking them down.

193
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,567
[laughing]

194
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,667
So who's the bitch here?

195
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,400
It's what I need to know
right away.

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,300
- You know what...I think we're
gonna appoint you.

197
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,367
You okay with that?

198
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,333
- Girl, no.

199
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,934
- She ain't that slick, honey,

200
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,066
Miss Mimi.

201
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,400
Before there was Mimi,
there was Mariah.

202
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,567
- Oh...

203
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,333
- Yes!

204
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,400
- Oh, my God.

205
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,934
- It's the purple people eater!

206
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,333
- [laughing]

207
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,500
Hi, ladies.

208
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,867
My name's Sutan,
also known as Raja.

209
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,967
I'm 36 years old, and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.

210
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,266
Raja's a model.

211
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,500
She's uber-stylish.

212
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,066
She was doing stuff that Gaga's
doing now

213
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,667
before Gaga even knew about it.

214
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,400
Yay!

215
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,066
- When Raja walked in,
100% pure family walked in.

216
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,300
- Umph, umph, umph!

217
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,667
I love you!

218
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,433
How are you?
What's your name?

219
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,500
- I see you lookin' at me.

220
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,967
[laughter]

221
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,533
Her look is definitely not
polished.

222
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,066
It's definitely not fabulous.

223
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,266
It almost looks as if I went

224
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,800
into my granny's trunk
in the attic.

225
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,967
- I could see the surprised look
on everyone's faces.

226
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,367
It was the exact the reaction
I wanted.

227
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,367
We're drag queens.

228
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,700
We're meant to be pioneers.

229
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,066
So why not wear a funny little
cyclops hat?

230
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,734
Nice to meet you.
I'm Raja.

231
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,867
It's a pleasure to meet you
guys.

232
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,367
- Club kid.

233
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,367
Where's her body, where's her
hair, where's her makeup?

234
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,500
I don't see her on the same
level as the rest of us.

235
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,433
[alarm whoops]

236
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:43,433
-<i> Whoo, girl!</i>

237
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,266
<i>You got shemail.</i>

238
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,700

00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,100
- Yes!

267

- That's a lotta fucking money.

281
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,500
- You know, they say Christmas
comes but once a year.

282
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,567
But around here, we like to deck
the halls all year round.

I have a little gift from me
to you.

288
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,066
Oh, pit crew!

00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,300

- Well, kiss that Christmas!

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,734
Baby, I was starting to get
a little sweaty.

294
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:22,934
These guys are fine.

295
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,333
Maybe there's something bigger
and buffer

296
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,333
coming out of the box.

297
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,533
I was ready for the third one.

298
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,066
It was about to be a party.

299
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,467
- Now, if good things come in
small packages,

300
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,800
then this is gonna be
re-donkulous!

301
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,500
- Hallelu, ladies!

302
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,133
- Oh, my God.

303
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,100
- Whoo!

304
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
- And there's Shangela.

305
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,133
Hallelu.

312
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
What the fuck?

313
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,266
Who invite this girl again?

314
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:13,133
She already got her moment
of glory.

315
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,200
She got eliminated.

316
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,533
- Sahara Davenport...

317
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,066
Shantay. You stay.

318
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,500
Shangela, you have only
just begun.

319
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,266
But I have a feeling...

320
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:28,767
we haven't seen
the last of you yet.

321
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,100
Now, for the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>

322
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,467
I'm giving one of my girls
a second chance.

323
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:39,233
Shangela will be joining you
in this competition.

324
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,433
all: Oh...

325
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,100
-<i> Welcome, Shangela.</i>

326
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,567
- It's a nice thing that
Shangela's here,

327
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,166
but she doesn't threaten me
in any way.

328
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,367
- So now that all 13 of my girls
are here...

329
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,700
are you ready for your close-up?

330
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,600
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.

331
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,967
- Come on, down, mami.

332
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,166
- What's going on?

333
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,800
- This is celebrity photographer
Mike Ruiz.

334
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,900
Mike has set up this gorgeous

335
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,533
Christmas winter wonderland
scenario,

336
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,734
and he's gonna get a few shots
of you.

337
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,066
- Okay.

338
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,400
- Today is the first challenge
of the entire race,

339
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,767
and it's so important

340
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,567
because it's the first
impression that they make.

341
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:19,066
- This is gonna be a sexy, sexy
cover of your Christmas card.

342
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,066
You are going to be jumping on
that trampoline to do it.

343
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,266
- Oh, God.

344
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,533
[laughing]

345
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm not gonna be able to pull
this off.

346
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,834
I'm wearing the wrong dress
to be jumping.

347
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,333
This is gonna be terrible.

348
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,400
Wait, let me just make sure that

349
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,233
all my jewels are locked away.

350
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,533
- Well, you've got several
jewels.

351
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,066
- Okay, all right,
let's do this, yo!

352
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,467
[laughs]

353
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,233
- It's snowin' at the Jersey
Shore!

354
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:46,567
Blow this, Snooki.

355
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,433
Yes, mama.

356
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,867
You...

357
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,300
- Oh--

358
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
[laughter]

359
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,266
- The flying lady
on a Rolls-Royce!

360
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,467
- Don't worry.
We're good, we're good.

361
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,567
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,367
That photo shoot
was such a mess.

363
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,400
I was not ready for none
of that.

364
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,967
-<i> Okay, we got one.</i>

365
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,834
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

366
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,200
<i>Gorgeous!</i>

367
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
- Uh-oh.

368
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,066
- Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm okay.

369
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,433
- Careful, Mimi.

370
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,166
I can see your nutcracker, hon.

371
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,066
- Whoo!

372
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,900
- [laughs]
Yeah...yeah.

373
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,567
Let's start again.
And hit it.

374
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,734
[camera shutter clicks]

375
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,066
Crazy. Okay.

376
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:31,633
Mimi had a really hard time
maintaining composure.

377
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,400
She wasn't giving us sexy.

378
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,066
She was giving us crazy.

379
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,100
- Pick your feet up.

380
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,333
Whoo--ooh hoo hoo!

381
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,066
- I'm jumping on the trampoline
with my boobs,

382
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,967
which are very heavy.

383
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:48,500
They weigh about 12 pounds.

384
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I was sweating to death.

385
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,834
They wanted to fall off.

386
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,066
- I think your breasts are
throwing your balance off.

387
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,066
- They're throwing
my balance off.

388
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,700
- [grunting]

389
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,734
- There ya go.

390
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:03,967
- [laughs]

391
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,500
I was a little nervous
about this challenge.

392
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,834
Me being a plus-size queen

393
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,066
trying to jump around on a
trampoline is not cute.

394
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,066
-<i> You gotta jump</i>
<i>as high as you can.</i>

395
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,500
<i>A little bit higher, if you</i>
<i>can.</i>

396
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,900
<i>One, two, three.</i>

397
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,600
- And he keeps telling me to
jump higher, jump higher.

398
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,367
But my fat ass, I'm sorry...

399
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:22,300
[laughs] I can't jump that high
on a trampoline.

400
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,633
-<i> One, two, three!</i>

401
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,400
Beautiful.

402
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,734
Okay, do something nasty now
with that candy cane.

403
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:32,967
Ride that cane!

404
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:34,200
Beautiful.

405
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Mariah just, like,
radiates sexuality.

406
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,233
- Your eggnog brings
all the boys to the yard.

407
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,333
Send in the clowns!

408
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,900
[laughter]

409
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,433
Hi, Raja.

410
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:50,467
- Hi, Raja!

411
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:51,467
- Come on down.

412
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,734
- W.T.F.?

413
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,600
To see a trampoline flanked
by half-nude men...

414
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,233
I mean, what else could
I ask for?

415
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:01,700
-<i> Gimme sexy face.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Oh, yes!</i>

416
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,734
-<i> Okay. You know what I want,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>

417
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,200
- Oh, yes, mami!

418
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,967
- Raja is this beautiful,
elegant gazelle.

419
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,066
He really has a good sense
of his body

420
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,367
and how to portray it
in a photograph.

421
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,066
One, two, three.

422
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,066
- Hi.

423
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,734
Ooh!

424
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:23,367
Look at you guys!

425
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,467
What's up, dudes?

426
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,066
What's up, bros?

427
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,133
Everyone's unpacking, and I got
a chance to kind of look around

428
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,233
the room and see everyone

429
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,367
stripped down
without their makeup,

430
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,600
the wigs are gone,
the paddings are gone.

431
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,333
And I got to see these men and,
you know what?

432
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,066
I've gotta say some of them
are kind of cute.

433
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,066
Yara's kind of a cute boy.

434
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,066
Tattoos.

435
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,934
Oh, my God, kind of hottie
over there.

436
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,633
Oh, my god, that one--is that
even out of drag yet?

437
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,400
Stacy looks like a girl out
of drag.

438
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I was like,
is that somebody's mama?

439
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,800
-<i> For Puerto Rico!</i>

440
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,667
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

441
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,567
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

442
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,900
- Alexis, a little Ann-Margret
she was giving me today.

443
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,800
And sexy face.
- Sexy face!

444
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,934
-<i> Gorgeous. We got it.</i>

445
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,266
<i>That was it.</i>

446
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,266
<i>Beautiful.</i>

447
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:11,233
<i>One, two, three.</i>

448
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:12,667
<i>Ooh, how phallic.</i>

449
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,100
Manila was actually really great
on the trampoline,

450
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,300
very limber and very capable.

451
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,133
- [gags]

452
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,467
[laughter]

453
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,467
-<i> Okay, we got it!</i>

454
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,500
- [gags]

455
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,400
- Good. And sexy!

456
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,266
- Oh...oh!

457
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:35,266
- Try and get off the ground
just a little bit more.

458
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,667
One, two, three.

459
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,934
Okay, and hit it.

460
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,133
Not so high with your hands.

461
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,433
Keep your hands down here.

462
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,333
One, two, three.

463
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,967
-<i> Ooh, Merry Christmas!</i>

464
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,066
-<i> Higher, higher!</i>

465
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,867
-<i> You look like a snow leopard.</i>

466
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,834
- Hi!
- Hey, Shangela.

467
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,934
- Hi, Ru!
- Good to see ya.

468
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,667
- Hey.
- Hi.

469
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,467
- One year later, and I'm in
front of Mike Ruiz again.

470
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,900
I have something to prove.

471
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,433
Get out here and turn it out.

472
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,233
Round two, baby.
I am ready.

473
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,066
- All right.
- I look forward to it.

474
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,700
<i>Okay, yea--</i>
<i>oh, yes, mama!</i>

475
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Sex-ual!

476
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,500
<i>Christmas never looked so sexy!</i>

477
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,934
-<i> You have made us proud.</i>
<i>You have done your homework.</i>

478
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,333
- Yay! Thank you.

479
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,967
Whoo!

480
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,633
Girl, got me right on together.

481
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:41,567
When I step into that room, I
felt like I'd gone back in time.

482
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,667
Well, I remember the spot that

483
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,200
was unlucky in love for me
last season,

484
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,066
so let me go find a new spot.

485
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,400
Hallelu!

486
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Ooh, praise him.

487
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,667
Ah.

488
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,567
Now, some of these new queens
may not be so excited that

489
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,500
Shangela is back
in the building.

490
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,400
- No, I auditioned, just like--

491
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
yeah, I auditioned
just like everyone else.

492
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
She kept asking me,
"Girl, how'd you get back?"

493
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,400
She seemed a little cunty
about it.

494
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,767
And I feel like over the last
year I've grown,

495
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,533
and also I wanted to come back
and compete

496
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:14,934
and really compete.

497
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,533
- Shangela, she says she's
gained enough experience.

498
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,900
All I can say, Shangela,
is prove it.

499
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,133
Serve it, girl.

500
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,400
Because you're under
the microscope now, bitch.

501
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,433
- She's probably one I'm gonna
have to watch my back for.

502
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,767
-<i> Ooh!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Yeah!</i>

503
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,734
[all whooping]

504
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,800
- Over here, baby.
Bring it over here.

505
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
Over here, over here.

506
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,567
- Hello, ladies.

507
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,066
Well, who are you?

508
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,734
[all whooping]

509
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:44,900
- Who are you people?

510
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,467
Now, Mike and I went over all
of your photographs.

511
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:52,600
One shot in particular really
got our jingle bells ringing.

512
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,667
The winner of the holiday card
photo shoot is...

513
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,166
Raja.
- Yes!

514
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,467
[cheers and applause]

515
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,133
To win the very first challenge
feels good,

516
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,900
feels like I've staked my claim

517
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,934
and put my little mark
on this competition.

518
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,100
I kinda lifted my leg
and pissed on it a little bit.

519
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,400
Cheers, bitches.

520
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
[applause]

521
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,033
- Now, tonight I expect you all
to have visions of sugar plums

522
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,433
dancing in your head.

523
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:30,000
Because the countdown has begun.

524
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,433
Tomorrow, I wanna see you in
your finest daywear drag.

525
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,333
And there's only one shopping
day left until it's Christmas

526
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,333
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

527
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,667
[cheers and applause]

528
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,166
[all speaking at once]

[wolf whistles]

531
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,300
- Being in drag in the middle
of the day's kind of weird.

532
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,266
It's like the circus
was in town.

534
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
- I felt a little uncomfortable.

535
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,333
I don't do that.

536
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,066
I don't go out in the daytime
in drag.

537
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,367
- When we find out that we have

538
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,200
to go out during the daytime
and go shopping in drag...

539
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,233
I'm good, 'cause, baby,
if it's right, it's right.

540
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,967
[bell dings]

541
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,700
[overlapping chatter]

542
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,200
- There we are,
standing in daytime drag

543
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,767
in the middle of some
thrift store.

544
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,066
Nobody clocked me.

545
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:30,734
They thought I was Jada Pinkett
Smith up in there.

546
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,734
- Gather 'round, dolls.

547
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:37,066
Now, Christmas is a season
for miracles and shopping.

548
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:41,066
And today, you need to do
a little bit of both.

549
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,467
Using only funky old clothes
and used household materials,

550
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,066
you need to ho ho ho it up...

551
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:51,166
by creating your jolliest
holiday drag look.

552
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:57,200
You can use your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.

553
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,667
Plus, any holiday chotchkies
you can...

554
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,834
mop.

555
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,467
But the rest of your outfit has

556
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:08,500
to be 100% thrift store couture,
darlings.

557
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,667
Tomorrow you will debut your

558
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:14,500
dragtacular holiday look
on the main stage.

559
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,400
Now, you each have $50 and ten
minutes to shop until you drop.

560
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,066
Now, Raja, since you won
the photo shoot,

561
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:27,367
you get an extra $25 to spend.

562
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,433
- [snaps]

563
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,133
- Gentlemen,
start your engines...

564
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,600
and may the best woman win!

565
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,467
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

566
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,100
- I had to throw those shoes off
and punch it.

567
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,834
First thing I eyed was that big
lamp in the window.

568
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,867
I knew I'd have to ask, please,
can you give a bitch a bargain?

569
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,233
I just have to have this,
and I don't have $45.

570
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,133
How 'bout $22?

571
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,300
I'm on a budget.

572
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,367
- $23.
- $23! Say hallelu for me.

573
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,900
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu! All right!

574
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,400
You ask, it shall be given.

575
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,767
- Can I see
that gold shiny thing?

576
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,066
- This thing?

577
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:10,367
- Maybe this could be my skirt.
- You've worn less.

578
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,533
- I'm not sure how much of
an outfit I'm gonna have.

579
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,834
You know, it's gonna have to be
something a little sexy.

580
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,433
- Out of my way, girl.

581
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,667
- It's all ugly.

582
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:21,734
- Just like some of these
contestants.

583
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,233
- Now, I've shopped in enough
thrift stores in my day to know

584
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:28,834
that very rarely are you gonna
find my size on a rack.

585
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:31,467
So I'm just gonna grab
all the fabric I can find.

586
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,500
I need a shopping cart.

587
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,667
-<i> Girl...</i>

588
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,633
- This is the best Christmas
ever.

589
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,266
-<i> Oh! It's so pretty.</i>

590
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,734
- When we walked back
into the workroom,

591
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,800
we have to rush and get any
holiday fixings that we can.

592
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,967
It's a race.

593
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,700
- These ladies are no ladies.

594
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,867
- Don't touch my shit.
This is mine.

595
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,567
-<i> They are runnin' around,</i>
<i>snatching things off the wall.</i>

596
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,367
<i>It is a mad dash.</i>

597
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,500
- Oh, girl,
I found myself a skirt.

598
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,600
Yes!

599
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,900
- Oh...

600
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,734
- Oh, yeah.
I'm ruling this fucking school.

601
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,266
- I just broke my Christian Dior
sunglasses doing this.

602
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,066
I better win this shit.

603
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,066
Ugh!

604
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:33,767
- I see Shangela.

605
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,834
She is dragging this big-ass

606
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,767
styrofoam snowman
across the room.

607
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,867
Is she gonna wear it?

608
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:41,400
I don't know
what she's gonna do.

609
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,200
- You always snatching.
What is that?

610
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm trying to be sister element
of surprise,

611
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,633
but it's hard when you got
a 5-foot snowman.

612
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:48,800
She missing a eye and a nose,

613
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,066
but she gonna be all right.

614
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:54,400
- Ladies, can I just say
something?

615
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,066
I am from Chicago!

616
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:59,934
[laughter]

617
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,567
- I was waiting
to see the first one

618
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,066
to start screaming at somebody.

619
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,133
I knew it was gonna be
her crazy ass.

620
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:08,266
Mimi, I think, is one of these
people that, um, really, really

621
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,867
wants to be center
of everything.

622
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,467
- Can I get an amen?

623
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,500
- Amen.

624
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,900
- Can I get
a [speaking gibberish]?

625
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,367
- If that's her way,
that's fine, but it's...

626
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,967
annoying as hell to me, so...

627
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,600
- [speaking gibberish]

628
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,800
- I don't know how I came up
with this idea, but...

629
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,967
it is working to my advantage.

630
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:43,533
I work great under pressure, and
I was just--I was feeling it.

631
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,900
I was feeling great.

632
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,734
[snapping]

633
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:49,133
-<i> Does anybody have any red</i>
<i>ornaments they don't want?</i>

634
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,734
- No, I need some too.
-<i> Okay.</i>

635
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:54,934
- Then I noticed Phoenix was
doing the same thing.

636
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,400
That's shady to me.

637
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,100
- Evidently, I'm "copying"
her amazing idea.

638
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,600
- You can be my friend or you
can be my enemy--

639
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,066
just say it to my face.

640
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:04,934
I mean, if somebody pisses me
off, I'm gonna tell 'em.

641
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,233
- I see the claws are comin' out
early, honey.

642
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,300
Whatever is in the dark
shall come to the light,

643
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,133
especially with regard
to this experience.

644
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,834
- The runway challenge is to
create a Christmas-inspired

645
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,467
outfit from all the things
that we got at the thrift shop.

646
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,533
- Honey, there was nothing
at that store my size.

647
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,266
I'm using bed sheets.

648
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:31,300
- Oh, right.

649
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,367
- Girl, if I get in this dress

650
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,300
and it does not fit,
I'm gonna cry.

651
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,700
- Ho, ho, ho, ladies.

652
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,834
- Hey.

653
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,734
- Hey, Ru.

654
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,400
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

655
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
- This is Laquifa.

656
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,066
Shangela Laquifa
in the Wadley family.

657
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,200
- I see.

658
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,934
- I've made a Shange-replica.

659
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,734
That's how I'm gonna turn it out
on that stage.

660
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,066
I designed this piece myself.

661
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,567
This is actually sewn onto
a bodice--I did that.

662
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,066
So hopefully, we'll all be
hitting the runway tomorrow.

663
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,567
- Well, that's all cute,

664
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,367
but we're talking about $75,000
here.

665
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,734
- But it's gonna work.

666
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,734
I feel like, I'm putting a lot
into my creation,

667
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,600
and I'm confident that it'll
at least go over well.

668
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,066
- Now, Shangela,
I have a lot of faith in you.

669
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,600
That's why I invited you back.

670
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,767
- I really appreciate it.

671
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,834
And I'm trying not
to disappoint you.

672
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,100
- All right, terrific.

673
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,767
- Thank you, Ru.

674
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,667
- Hey, Phoenix.

675
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,533
- Hey, Ru.
- Merry Christmas.

676
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:29,800
- You too!
- This is pretty amazing.

677
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Now, these are--are what?

678
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,100
- Shattered...

679
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,667
- Oh, shattered glass.

680
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,367
- Mm-hmm. Shattered glass, yes.

681
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,767
- Oh, you're showing a lot
of creativity--we like that.

682
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,767
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Phoenix.

683
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,700
- Thank you, babe.

684
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,500
- Mimi Mimi Mimi Imfurst.

685
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,100
- Ho ho ho, Ru.
- Ho ho ho to you!

686
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,333
Now, I wanna talk about
this amazing...

687
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,633
- [laughs]

688
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,867
- Outfit you have here.

689
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,333
It's very, uh, manger couture.

690
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:01,300
Would you say you were halfway
done, 3/4 of the way done?

691
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,567
- [laughs] I don't know!

692
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm just really nervous,
'cause I don't sew.

693
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,200
Throw me a script, throw me
a song to sing, I can do it.

694
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,567
- Well, you know, those have

695
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,834
been some famous last words
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

696
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,066
- I know, I know, I'm just--

697
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm--I'm so nervous.

698
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,266
- But you know,
there are other

699
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,767
girls here who don't know
how to sew,

700
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,300
but they're gluin'
and puttin' things together...

701
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,900
we'll see how it plays
on the runway.

702
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,200
- All right.

703
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,166
I am nervous as hell,
because I

704
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:29,433
have a raggedy-ass dress, but I
have a big problem on my hands.

705
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:34,233
- Manila Luzon.

706
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,667
- Hi, Ru!

707
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,567
- So now, I wanna hear
about your outfit.

708
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:41,734
- So I'm gonna have like a fur
collar, and then with the extra,

709
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,500
I'm gonna make a muff.

710
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,867
- Let's talk about this!

711
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:46,867
[laughing]

712
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,266
You got this picture of...

713
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:50,867
- That's Sahara Davenport,
my boyfriend.

714
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,200
- How about that?

715
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,233
- Yeah, she was here last
season, so I brought this.

716
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,767
I have my little sketch pad.

717
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,100
Having my boyfriend being
Sahara,

718
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,467
I don't think it's gonna

719
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:03,333
have any effect on my chances
of winning this contest.

720
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,300
Besides, Sahara didn't win,

721
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,066
and I'm going to.

722
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,233
- All right, so I'm gonna let
you get back to work.

723
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

724
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Venus D-Lite.
- Ru-Ru!

725
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,300
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

726
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,767
Chrissy kiss!
Kissy kiss!

727
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,633
- Now, look what you have here.

728
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,867
Showgirl always, aren't you?

729
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,266
- Yes. This was a jacket.

730
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:24,367
I took off the collar, got
ornaments, and I crushed them,

731
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,700
gave it a little glitzy color.

732
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,633
- The crushed thing here--
I saw it on a few others.

733
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,667
Who had it first?

734
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,266
- Me.
- You did.

735
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,500
- And the bitches stole it.

736
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,734
- [laughs] All right, Venus.

737
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,300
- All right, Ru-Ru.
- Carry on.

738
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,233
- Till next time.
Kissy kissies!

739
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,066
- [laughing]

740
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,233
Raja.

741
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,300
- Hey, Ru.

742
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,266
- Hello.

743
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,400
Well, look at this.

744
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,166
It's very Christmas pudding

745
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:50,467
at Vivienne Westwood's
on Boxing Day.

746
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,633
- You're so right!

747
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,800
That's exactly
what I was going for.

748
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,333
But I really wanted to kinda do
the idea of, like, gift wrap

749
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,433
and how under a Christmas tree,
it's all sort of, like,

750
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:00,633
hodgepodge and mixed up together
and a little

751
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,133
Christmas tree green skirt
'cause, you know,

752
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,300
that's where you keep all the
presents is under the tree.

753
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,533
Yes, ma'am!

754
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,600
- Well, I can't wait to see this
on the runway.

755
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,133
So keep working on it,
turn it out...

756
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:13,433
- Okay.
- And I'll see you later on.

757
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,233
Good luck.
- All right, Ru.

758
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:17,333
Thanks a lot.

759
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,734
- Hey, Carmen.

760
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,433
Wow, look, you've got your
Christmas goin' on here.

761
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,433
- Feeling a little spicy
this Christmas.

762
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:26,033
- Well, something tells me you
feel spicy every Christmas.

763
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,100
- Yes.

764
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,066
- And Easter...

765
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:29,066
- Uh-huh.

766
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,567
- And Memorial Day.

767
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,300
This is a lotta body showing.

768
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,166
Oh, she has a little booty-booty
back here.

769
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,500
- Yeah, this is the mistletoe
back there.

770
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,033
- Oh, that's the mistletoe!

771
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,800
I'ma let you get back to it.

772
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,533
I can't wait to see you
pull this off on the stage.

773
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:46,433
All right, get back to work.

774
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,433
- All right, thank you.

775
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,333
- All right.

776
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,900
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

777
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,266
- Well, hello, Ru.

778
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,400
- Are you having fun?

779
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,533
It seems like
you're the shy one.

780
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:56,633
- I'm not shy.

781
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:57,734
I'm just focused.

782
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,967
[both laughing]

783
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,166
- Now, have you been
to California before?

784
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,467
- No, this is my first time,
actually.

785
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:04,633
- First time in Hollywood.

786
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,400
- First time on a plane.
- First time on a plane.

787
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,834
How about--we are just changing
lives over here!

788
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,200
- I know!
I feel like a different person.

789
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,066
- But can you bring
the charisma,

790
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,200
uniqueness, nerve, and talents?

791
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,367
- I have that,
or I wouldn't be here.

792
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,867
[both laughing]

793
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:20,834
- Good luck.

794
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,500
- Thank you.
- All right.

795
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,533
Gather 'round, dolls.

796
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,367
All right, ladies.

797
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,900
Tomorrow, on the main stage,

798
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,700
we'll be spending the holidays

799
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,967
with our extra-special guest
judge, the one and only...

800
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,567
Vanessa Williams.

801
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,333
[cheers and applause]

802
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,400
- For some gays and some queens,
they've got Cher and Madonna.

803
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,667
But I'm a big Vanessa Williams
fan.

804
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,066
- 'Tis the season for giving...

805
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:52,633
so you better be serving up
some holiday realness...

806
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,867
or this could be
your last Christmas.

807
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:58,367
So don't fuck it up.

808
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,867
I'll see you on the main stage.

809
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:00,934
Bye.

810
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,433
all: Bye.

811
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:13,433
- [sobbing]

812
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,166
I fucked it up.

813
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,934
I don't know
what I was thinking!

814
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,467
I don't know how to sew and,
um...

815
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:25,066
[sniffles] I know it's
my biggest hurdle and...

816
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,166
I'm just a--I've worked so hard
to get here, and I'm just...

817
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,600
I don't wanna fail.

818
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,700
[sniffles]

819
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,934
- Is she okay?

820
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,467
- No.

821
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,266
- Girl, seriously...

822
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,433
come here, babe.

823
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:38,533
If you have a undergarment,

824
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,333
take it out,
like a full undergarment.

825
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,834
- I don't.

826
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,166
Mariah came over, and she sort
of helped me rethink everything.

827
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,133
- Get your undergarment.

828
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,900
Go get your undergarments.

829
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,667
You need your undergarments.

830
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,133
I knew she had bitten off more
than she could chew so,

831
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,467
you know, when she broke down,
I was like, "Oh, baby."

832
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,734
- What you need to do is pick
out some of your fiercest hair

833
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:01,900
and, bitch, paint
for filth tomorrow.

834
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,266
I feel bad for her.

835
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:04,767
I think, you know, she feels
that she's gonna have

836
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,266
to lip-synch for her life
tomorrow night,

837
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,667
and, honestly, I think so too.

838
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:12,300
- Girl, don't blow your nose
on the fabric, bitch.

839
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,767
- Mimi is freaked out.

840
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:18,467
Girl! Put yourself together,
darling!

841
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,734
- It's okay, mama.

842
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,533
- No, it's not.

843
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,166
I just have to finish
what I'm working on,

844
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,567
and tomorrow
when I hit the runway,

845
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:29,166
I wanna sell it like it's
a million-dollar dress.

846
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,500
And if I have to lip-synch,

847
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,433
I'll mother fucking lip-synch
my life off.

848
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:35,500
[sniffles]

849
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:40,867
- Hallelu.

850
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:43,734
- Back to work, ladies.

851
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,767
- We're back in the workroom
this morning, and we only have a

852
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:48,066
little bit of time to finish up
our Christmas couture.

853
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,066
- The vibe in the workroom felt

854
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,500
very much like
a Santa's workshop,

855
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,233
like, all the elves
were really busy.

856
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,934
- Okay, how come I can't even
sew a fucking jingle bell?

857
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:00,066
This is just hanging there
like a limp scrotum.

858
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:02,166
- The emotions are pretty
intense in the room.

859
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,133
Everyone knows that someone's
gotta go home,

860
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,900
and it doesn't matter how
perfect you think you are

861
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,767
or how bad you think
the other person is,

862
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,834
because there's always gonna be
an element of surprise

863
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,667
to these things.

864
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,767
- You feeling a little bit
better today, baby?

865
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:15,767
- A little bit.

866
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:16,967
- Okay.

867
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,367
- I had a very long night.

868
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:21,633
I didn't sleep very well,
but I just need to finish the

869
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:24,166
garment and sell it
when I go down the runway.

870
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,100
I'm just gonna pray
for a miracle.

871
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,600
- So, Venus, who do you think
is in the bottom?

872
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,500
- I think, um,
Mimi's going home.

873
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,900
Yesterday, Mimi had her
breakdown,

874
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,200
and today, I could just see it
all over her face.

875
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,333
I don't think you can be the

876
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,066
Next Drag Superstar
with no confidence.

877
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:44,100
- The other queens saw me
at a really vulnerable place,

878
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,266
so they think
that I might be weak.

879
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:48,834
Whatever.

880
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,133
In this business,
you have to be driven.

881
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,934
I don't think that there's any
drag performers

882
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,633
who are more driven than I am.

883
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,100
I think she might be a dress!

884
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,367
- Mimi had this idea of doing
this Virgin Mary thing.

885
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:03,734
It just looked like a laundry
bag full of, like, old sheets.

886
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,667
- The last time around I looked
around the room and said,

887
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,533
"Oh, girl, let me get this song
right, 'cause I don't wanna be

888
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,867
in the bottom two."

889
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,166
I don't wanna be lip-synching
for my life again.

890
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,734
It wasn't the best experience
in the world.

891
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:19,367
But this time around,

892
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,800
I feel really super-confident
about my outfit.

893
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,834
- What was it like to lip-synch
for your life last year, girl?

894
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,066
- Girl.

895
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,533
Girl, have you ever felt like

896
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,900
you were walking the plank
in the pirate ship, okay?

897
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,400
I felt like<i> Pirates</i>
<i>of the Caribbean.</i>

898
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,600
- The time has come...

899
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,066
for you to lip-synch...

900
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,967
for your life.

901
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,567
- It's funny that the phrase is
"lip-synch for your life,"

902
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,800
because it really feels like
you're gonna die.

903
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,133
No one knows that feeling
until you're there.

904
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:49,200
Being titled America's Next Drag
Superstar is a big deal.

905
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,300
And I'm not taking it lightly
that I'm back.

906
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
- How's your outfit comin',
Raja?

907
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,233
- Pretty good, actually.

908
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,734
I'm getting really happy
with it.

909
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,133
- How old are ya?
- I'm 36.

910
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,266
- Are you seriously?

911
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,767
- I started dabbling in drag
when I was 16.

912
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,834
In my teens, I was a pretty
awkward kid.

913
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:05,100
You know, walking down the
street, it was like, "faggot."

914
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,533
Drag wasn't bad.

915
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,967
Drag was like, "Fierce, honey!

916
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,066
Fabulous, girl, work,"
you know,

917
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,133
and that's what I needed.

918
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,367
As the years start to pass,

919
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,734
you start to, like,
look at drag differently.

920
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:16,233
- Do you love it more or...

921
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,233
- I love it in a different way.

922
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,300
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

923
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,567
'Cause it's always, like,
changing.

924
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,667
- Yeah.

925
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,433
And I wanna evolve constantly,
you know?

926
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:27,600
I don't ever wanna be the same
queen for the rest of my life.

927
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,834
- So what do you do, Venus?

928
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,633
- I'm a Madonna impersonator,
mainly.

929
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,100
- Her Madonna is fierce.

930
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,133
She looks just like the bitch.

931
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:39,600
- I came out at 15, and pretty
much, nobody accepted me.

932
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,567
And all the bullcrap that I went
through growing up,

933
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,333
I think it ended up
making me

934
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,066
a very determined
and driven person.

935
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,600
- Do you do anyone else
besides Madonna?

936
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,900
- I do a lot of characters,

937
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,533
but I had plastic surgery
to look more like Madonna.

938
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,233
[record scratch effect]

939
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:54,767
- Really? What'd you do?

940
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,967
- I had my cheeks done
and my chin.

941
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,633
- Miss Venus, you're too young,

942
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,867
baby, to have that much work
in your face.

943
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,633
That much wrong work.

944
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,967
- Let me see.

945
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,600
Where is it?

946
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,734
Oh...

947
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,467
- See?
- Is it silicone or--

948
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:09,600
- It's silicone, yeah.

949
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,767
- I have never had
any plastic surgery.

950
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:14,066
It's like baseball players
taking steroids.

951
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,233
You're sort of cheating.

952
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,467
- I've had this three times
and this two.

953
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,433
- Well, you better work
that Madonna look, grr.

954
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,867
- All my money and all my time
has gone into drag.

955
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,266
I've dedicated, devoted,

956
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:26,200
compromised my whole life to be
a drag queen,

957
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,567
and I think that's why I'm here.

958
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,200
Carmen, you always naked.

959
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,166
Naked.
- Sorry. I have to get ready.

960
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,734
- Naked.

961
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:38,734
- She has been runnin' around
the dressing room all day

962
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,066
completely naked.

963
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,133
Just naked.

964
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,633
I mean, is this
a sex competition,

965
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:47,667
or is this a holiday couture
competition?

966
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,567
- Miss Carmen,
you gotta be naked.

967
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,400
- Girl, I don't even see it
as naked.

968
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,266
I don't know what these queens
are talkin' about.

969
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,233
I'm sorry, you know, I feel
comfortable with my body.

970
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,567
For me, it's a locker room.

971
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,834
[tape roll stretching]

972
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,934
- I think this hot glue gun
gets way too hot.

973
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,734
It's like a lava gun right here.

974
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:04,600
- They don't call it
a warm glue gun.

975
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,667
- Oh, fuck.
This hurts.

976
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:09,767
- Fuck.

977
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:13,567
- I think everyone
is just really on edge.

978
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,734
We don't have that much time
before we have to be all up in

979
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,133
drag and walkin' out
on that runway.

980
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,433
- How you holding up?

981
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:20,934
- I wish I had more time.

982
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:22,166
- You gonna have another
breakdown, girl?

983
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,400
- I hope not.

984
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,967
- Only have a breakdown
if I'm goin' home.

985
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,066
Hey, guys.

986
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:48,767
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

987
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:53,066
Now, tonight is like a RuPaul
family Christmas special,

988
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:54,967
and it wouldn't be Christmas
without

989
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:57,100
our very own Santa Claus!

990
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,600
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

991
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,834
[laughter]

992
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,867
- The funniest man on earth,
Bruce Vilanch.

993
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:03,967
Hi, Bruce.

994
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,066
- Hi, Ru.

995
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,233
- We are so glad you're here.

996
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,900
- It's tough for a Jewish boy
to do this.

997
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,266
- I know.
I know.

998
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:12,166
But in this economy,
you'll take it where you can.

999
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,266
- Exactly. I'm up-sizing.

1000
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:16,200
[laughter]

1001
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,734
- Santino!
- Hey, Ru.

1002
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,100
- Hello, my dear.

1003
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,767
- Shall we dance?
- Let's.

1004
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,066
- [laughs]

1005
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:26,500
- And the return of Michelle
Visage,

1006
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,066
my cohost for over 100 episodes
of the<i> RuPaul</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talk show.</i>

1007
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,266
- Couldn't keep us apart.

1008
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,700
- [laughs]

1009
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
And Mike Ruiz.

1010
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,834
- Yes!

1011
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,967
- We've just gotta stop
meeting like this.

1012
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,266
- I know!

1013
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,433
- Prissy kissness.

1014
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:43,567
And I saved the best for last.

1015
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:46,500
[laughter]

1016
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,967
The lovely and talented

1017
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,900
Vanessa Williams is here!

1018
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,967
- Darling, you look phenomenal.

1019
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,200
- Thank you so much.

1020
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,934
I see you glittering
over there too.

1021
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:58,500
- Thank you.
Got some gifts for Santa.

1022
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,633
- Yes!

1023
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:00,767
- Thank you!

1024
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:01,834
[laughter]

1025
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,100
- This week, our queens were

1026
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,834
challenged to make their best
holiday drag looks

1027
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:09,834
using thrift store hand-me-downs
and Christmas decorations.

1028
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:13,533
Gentlemen...start your engines.

1029
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,300
And may the best woman win!

1030
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,667
Carmen Carrera.

1031
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,066
- Hey, hey.

1032
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,400
- Look at the size of that box!

1033
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,834
-<i> My lips are done,</i>
<i>my hair is done.</i>

1034
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,266
<i>I'm feeling hot right now.</i>

1035
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:28,767
<i>The spotlight is on me.</i>

1036
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,533
<i>You can see my cheeks from</i>
<i>across the street.</i>

1037
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:32,900
- Uh-uh!

1038
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,834
- Oh, the mistletoe.

1039
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,600
- Is that mistletoe
or cameltoe?

1040
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,100
- Look at that body. Ah!

1041
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,700
- Manila Luzon.

1042
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,033
- Look at the size
of that muff!

1043
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,367
- Both hands fit.

1044
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,934
-<i> I am living on the runway.</i>

1045
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,433
<i>I'm having so much fun.</i>

1046
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:51,300
<i>The snow is coming, and</i>
<i>I'm just struttin' my stuff.</i>

1047
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,934
- A desperate housewife
of the North Pole.

1048
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,433
- All right!

1049
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,467
- He's giving us
Janice Dickinson.

1050
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,934
- It's Yara Sofia,

1051
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:02,700
and she's had her nose fixed!

1052
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,834
- What a fabulous
set of antlers.

1053
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:07,734
-<i> I was so nervous,</i>
<i>but I feel great.</i>

1054
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:11,367
<i>I did a good job,</i>
<i>and I give them a surprise.</i>

1055
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,066
- Hey!

1056
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,066
[chuckles]

1057
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:15,300
- Incredible.

1058
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,200
- I love it!

1059
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,934
- Oh, who do we have here?

1060
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,567
That's Phoenix?

1061
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,066
Ahoy!

1062
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,900
-<i> I think it was definitely</i>
<i>the best Christmas couture</i>

1063
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,300
<i>that I could give.</i>

1064
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,233
<i>I think my shit's fierce.</i>
<i>I think I could win.</i>

1065
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:30,100
- Oh, holy night,
that skirt is short.

1066
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,567
- I can see her figgy pudding!

1067
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,700
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

1068
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,066
Representin' Back Swamp,
North Carolina.

1069
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:40,333
-<i> I think it's time</i>
<i>for a plus-size queen.</i>

1070
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,233
<i>The skinny girls try</i>
<i>to take over,</i>

1071
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,633
<i>so I think it's time</i>
<i>for us big girls to step up.</i>

1072
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:47,400
- Now, that's
the<i> Jingle Bell Rock.</i>

1073
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
Oh, it's Venus D-Lite!

1074
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,734
Merry Christmas.

1075
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,533
-<i> I'm just really trying to be</i>
<i>fun and sassy, little flirty.</i>

1076
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:55,934
<i>I'm being me.</i>

1077
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,333
- Oh, lick it.

1078
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,767
That looks delicious.

1079
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,400
- Somebody's gonna get caned.

1080
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,066
- India Ferrah.

1081
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,066
- Okay, now.

1082
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,600
Look at those two treats.

1083
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,367
- Santa, would you like some
milk to go with those cookies?

1084
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,900
-<i> I'm looking good, bitch.</i>

1085
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,633
<i>My hair is done, makeup right,</i>

1086
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:12,934
<i>and I'm just walking</i>
<i>down the runway,</i>

1087
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,467
<i>knowing that I look sickening.</i>

1088
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:17,967
- Ooh, the Fahrenheit
is getting higher!

1089
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,400
- Delta Work.

1090
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,367
And she is giving us
a Kwanzaa celebration.

1091
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,834
-<i> As soon as I hit the runway,</i>

1092
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,066
<i>I am just--I'm so excited.</i>

1093
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,266
<i>It's exhilarating.</i>

1094
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:28,867
<i>It's what I've been waiting</i>
<i>for.</i>

1095
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,600
<i>And I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>giving Kwanzaa realness.</i>

1096
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,467
- Erykah Badu!

1097
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,934
Leontyne Price.

1098
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:36,867
[laughter]

1099
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:40,066
From Puerto Rico...
Alexis.

1100
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:41,166
- Ooh!

1101
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,166
- [trilling]

1102
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,900
-<i> Feliz Navidad.</i>

1103
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,967
Cha, cha, cha!

1104
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:47,967
-<i> I'm feeling fabulous.</i>

1105
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,433
<i>The light, the music,</i>
<i>adrenaline comin' through.</i>

1106
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:53,233
<i>I'm just feeling</i>
<i>on the top of the world.</i>

1107
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,300
- Oh!

1108
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,667
Oh, yes! Okay.

1109
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,367
El Barbizono modeling school-o.

1110
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,433
- Love the snowflake earrings.

1111
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:04,734
- Next, Mimi Imfurst.

1112
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:06,800
- Oh, little baby Jesus
in her hands?

1113
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,200
- Oh, yes,
it's the Madonna!

1114
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,567
- It is!
It's the mother.

1115
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:10,667
- Oh, wait a minute, that's--

1116
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,400
that's actually a ham
in her arms.

1117
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,734
-<i> I hit the runway,</i>

1118
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,900
<i>and I just decide in my mind</i>
<i>that I'm going</i>

1119
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,934
<i>to deliver this dress</i>
<i>and deliver the character.</i>

1120
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:20,266
- I wanna see baby Jesus.

1121
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,867
- I know--is he asleep
right now?

1122
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,834
- He's cooking at 350!

1123
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:28,533
- Hotlanta's own,
Mariah.

1124
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:31,066
- In Christmas gray.

1125
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,967
- Oh, she's giving a little
Wilhelmina Slater, I'd say.

1126
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:35,867
- Yes, she is!

1127
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,900
-<i> I'm not polished as well</i>
<i>as I know I can be,</i>

1128
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,667
<i>but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let the judges see that.</i>

1129
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,133
<i>I'm never gonna let them</i>
<i>see me sweat.</i>

1130
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,767
- Silver bells!

1131
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,300
- Couture Christmas.

1132
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,133
- Karl Lagerfeld,
eat your heart out.

1133
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:53,867
Up next is Raja!

1134
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:57,066
Oh, no stranger to the runway.

1135
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:59,066
- Look at the detail
on that skirt.

1136
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:00,467
- Vivienne Westwood!

1137
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:01,834
What?

1138
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,934
-<i> Once I get out there,</i>
<i>I feel awesome.</i>

1139
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:04,967
<i>That's my thing.</i>

1140
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:05,967
<i>I am a runway girl.</i>

1141
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:06,934
<i>I am a photography girl.</i>

1142
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,066
<i>I'm a model.</i>

1143
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,133
- I just can't take my eyes
off of her.

1144
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,266
- Gorgeous!

1145
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,300
- Yes! Snow angels!

1146
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,900
- Was it snow angels or a fit?

1147
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,800
[laughter]

1148
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,600
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

1149
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,333
Oh, she's gained weight!

1150
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,934
Oh, there she is.

1151
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:24,633
- She made a snowman.

1152
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:26,066
- She's a little frosty.

1153
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,633
Oh, and she's got her piece
of corn there.

1154
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:29,633
- All right!

1155
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,133
- It's become a tradition here.

1156
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,433
Oh, and her skirts light up!

1157
00:44:33,433 --> 00:44:36,100
Where is she keeping
the batteries?

1158
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,467
-<i> I am feeling so confident.</i>

1159
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,233
<i>I love my outfit,</i>
<i>and all I can think is,</i>

1160
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:41,667
<i>"Shangela, work, bitch."</i>

1161
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:42,867
- You know what I say.

1162
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:45,600
Never work with animals,
children, or snowmen.

1163
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:52,433
Welcome, ladies.

1164
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:54,433
Based on your Christmas drag,

1165
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:57,233
your holiday card photo shoot,

1166
00:44:57,233 --> 00:45:00,500
and your presentation
on the main stage,

1167
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,367
I've made some decisions.

1168
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,800
Will the following queens
please step forward?

1169
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,600
Mariah.

1170
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,900
Delta Work.

1171
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,667
Yara Sofia.

1172
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:18,633
India Ferrah.

1173
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,533
Phoenix.

1174
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:24,100
Stacy Layne Matthews.

1175
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,934
Alexis Mateo.

1176
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,066
The seven of you
all stood out...

1177
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,700
for not standing out
from the crowd.

1178
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,066
You are all safe
from elimination.

1179
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,900
But I warn you.

1180
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,567
In this competition,
with $75,000 at stake...

1181
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:48,100
"Safe" is a dirty word.

1182
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:53,066
You may leave the stage.

1183
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,533
All right, ladies...

1184
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:04,200
you six are the nicest and
the naughtiest of the week.

1185
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,767
It is time
for the judges' critiques.

1186
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,734
Let's start with Carmen Carrera.

1187
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,900
- Well, I think Carmen
used her assets to a T.

1188
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,166
- Yes, ma'am!

1189
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,333
- All I can think of is bows,
bows, booty.

1190
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,533
You used what your maker gave to
you, and you brought the sexy.

1191
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:24,266
- From one Jersey girl to
another, Carmen, you're hot.

1192
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:25,400
You know you're hot.

1193
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,233
Here's my one concern:

1194
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:30,166
don't rely on body all the time.

1195
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:34,133
- Y'all, I'd like to hear
from Santa, Bruce Vilanch.

1196
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:36,100
- I'm very concerned
about the mistletoe,

1197
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,166
because I think it's bad when
anything takes root there.

1198
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,400
[laughter]

1199
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,633
- Thank you, Bruce.

1200
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,066
Let's take a look
at your holiday photo.

1201
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:48,767
- You didn't really get into,
like, the dancer-ly beauty

1202
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,233
of what I was asking
of you guys.

1203
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:53,433
- I've never done
the trampoline before,

1204
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,166
and getting on it,
I pulled a muscle.

1205
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:58,066
So I wasn't really ready for
this, and it was kind of like,

1206
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:01,867
the hair wasn't really working
with the--what I had on my arm,

1207
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:03,734
which was getting caught
to the chiffon.

1208
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:04,967
And then my lip gloss was stuck,

1209
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,400
you know, and I swallowed
a piece of snow and...

1210
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,867
- There's a lot of excuses.

1211
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,066
You know, this is a competition.

1212
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:12,934
At the end of the day,
nobody gives a crap.

1213
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:15,233
You just have to bring it.

1214
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,066
- Next up, Manila Luzon.

1215
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:20,734
- Being from New York,
you reminded me of a Rockette.

1216
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:22,433
And the second thing was
Marie Osmond, for some reason.

1217
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:24,400
It's very Marie Osmond,
isn't it?

1218
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,300
- She has really big hair
these days.

1219
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,333
- But very well put together.

1220
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,567
- Thank you.

1221
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:32,300
- You are a magical,
fantastical confection.

1222
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,500
- Well, this is the second dress

1223
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,567
that I've ever sewn in my life.

1224
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,867
- Wow. It's great.

1225
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:38,066
It looks like Louis Vuitton.

1226
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,200
- Oh!

1227
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,967
- I thought more La Toya
Vuitton.

1228
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,767
[laughter]

1229
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:46,767
Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

1230
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:50,367
Where'd you get the idea to use
a big prop like that?

1231
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,400
- Oh, you talking about
Frostula?

1232
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,433
Frostula the Snow Ho.

1233
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:57,400
And if she came to life,
it would be Shangela.

1234
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,767
- You kind of have a mild
concept going,

1235
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:03,333
but it's still very kind
of remedial.

1236
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,500
The execution is poor.

1237
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,433
The back, it's kind
of falling apart.

1238
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,734
There just could have been
more attention to detail.

1239
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:13,433
- Now, I did learn to sew.

1240
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,500
However, it was a little

1241
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,300
difficult in working
with a paper material.

1242
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,667
That was new for me.

1243
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:21,633
- Here's the thing--you bring
out a big giant snowman.

1244
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,200
The snowman was bigger
than the payoff.

1245
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,567
And the thing about props--

1246
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,367
you never wanna be upstaged
by a papier-mache snowman,

1247
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:28,400
you know what I'm saying?

1248
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,066
You don't!

1249
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:31,300
- Well, I tell you,
on that note,

1250
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,900
let's take a look
at your photograph

1251
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,400
and see how well you did.

1252
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
- I see a lot of armpit.

1253
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,533
That's the first thing I went
to,

1254
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:38,967
it was like--
armpit, you know.

1255
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:40,734
- But it's fresh.

1256
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:43,100
[laughter]

1257
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,467
- All right, Shangela,
thank you very much.

1258
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,066
Next up, Venus D-Lite.

1259
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:50,500
How'd it feel for you up
on the runway?

1260
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,800
- I was just having a ball.

1261
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,133
- Can you turn around
and show me your ponytail?

1262
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:57,600
That is really, I think,
the best part of your outfit.

1263
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,800
I think the rest of the outfit
is overdone.

1264
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,133
What did Coco Chanel say?

1265
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:03,333
"Before you leave the house,
take one thing off"?

1266
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,834
You've got the snowflake
and the beaded shoes

1267
00:49:05,834 --> 00:49:07,266
and then the beaded lapel.

1268
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:09,066
I mean, it's a lot goin' on.

1269
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:10,567
- Of the fabrications you
selected,

1270
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,367
the whole mix isn't really
working for me.

1271
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,600
You look like
a sad Christmas elf.

1272
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
- The choices that I had
to make an outfit--

1273
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,800
it was very limited.

1274
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,967
And I'm saving the best
for later.

1275
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,967
- Well, Venus, as you know,
in this competition,

1276
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:28,667
with $75,000 at stake,
everything you do counts.

1277
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,734
So that's not really an excuse.

1278
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:35,767
Next, Mimi Imfurst.

1279
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,066
You've got such a big heart.

1280
00:49:37,066 --> 00:49:38,066
- Thank you!

1281
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:39,166
[laughter]

1282
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,166
I've got a big everything, girl.

1283
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,600
I actually only weigh 98 pounds.

1284
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,734
The rest of this is liver.

1285
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:44,734
- Ah!

1286
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,400
[laughter]

1287
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,467
- It's really a twist on

1288
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,467
something that
is very religious,

1289
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:54,500
and you are making it delightful
and campy

1290
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,700
and really putting a spin on it.

1291
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,066
- You have a great concept.

1292
00:49:58,066 --> 00:50:02,533
There's a amateurish quality
about it, but I love it.

1293
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:03,734
I think it all works.

1294
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,934
- Santa Claus,
meet the Virgin Mary.

1295
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:07,900
- I think you're show business.

1296
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,200
You're what it's about.

1297
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,834
And you had a concept,
and you had an execution,

1298
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:14,100
and you've been carrying
that baby longer

1299
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,567
than Rose Kennedy
carried 12 children.

1300
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,066
[laughter]

1301
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,400
- I'm kind of surprised,
in some ways,

1302
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,767
that you have
said such kind words.

1303
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,600
You guys have sort
of renewed my faith today

1304
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,500
in doing what you trust
in your heart.

1305
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,600
- Thank you, Mimi.

1306
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,333
Raja, you won
the photo challenge.

1307
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,467
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1308
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:35,734
- Flawless.

1309
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:38,200
- It's obvious to me
you have incredible style.

1310
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,934
You work this runway
like a supermodel.

1311
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:42,900
- And you're not taking yourself
too seriously,

1312
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,066
which kind of embodies, like,
the whole well-rounded,

1313
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:49,367
like, drag superstar kind
of thing that we're going for.

1314
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:52,000
- For me, it's what, like,
drag artistry is all about.

1315
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,533
It's just doing something
unexpected

1316
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,467
and creating it out of nothing.

1317
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,734
- This is what I do, you know?

1318
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,266
I'm a runway girl, I'm a model.

1319
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:02,100
I'm<i> Supermodel of the World,</i>
the sequel,

1320
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,100
I'd like to say.

1321
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,066
[laughter]

1322
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:06,700
- The only thing that I might
suggest is

1323
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,433
that you project a little more
in your voice.

1324
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,900
- I mean, I can certainly
speak louder,

1325
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,066
but she's making me nervous,
so...

1326
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:14,533
[giggles]

1327
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,567
- Thank you, ladies.

1328
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,633
Thank you, Bruce.

1329
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:19,600
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail

1330
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,200
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

1331
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,166
the judges
and I will deliberate.

1332
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,633
You may leave the stage.

1333
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,934
Just between us "goils,"

1334
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,266
what do you think?

1335
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:33,567
Let's start with Carmen.

1336
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,100
- Carmen brought bo-dy.

1337
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,300
I'm still mesmerized
how she tucked all that stuff--

1338
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,734
I don't know
where the heck it went,

1339
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:41,800
but it was an amazing tuck.

1340
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,867
The one thing I thought might
have lacked was her personality.

1341
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,200
- Although, I'm sort of a sucker
for that "Joisey,"

1342
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,066
you know, thing like dat,
you know.

1343
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,533
- I wanted more Jersey.

1344
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:55,066
I have no idea who Carmen is,
at this point, but a body.

1345
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:56,734
- What about Manila Luzon?

1346
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:58,567
- I think she is gorgeous.

1347
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:02,700
She really embodied the spirit
of a winter wonderland.

1348
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,900
- The only thing I might say is

1349
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,066
she's funny and engaging
for a cocktail party

1350
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,734
but not really
in an entertainment,

1351
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,066
kind of showbiz-y kinda way.

1352
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:11,500
- Right.

1353
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,066
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.

1354
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:16,934
- I did think that her outfit
looked a little unfinished.

1355
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,100
She could have done better.

1356
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,467
- She kind of flubbed it.

1357
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:23,100
- I don't know if Shangela
has the consistency

1358
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,066
to make it further
in this competition.

1359
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:29,500
- The personality supersedes
her tailoring skills.

1360
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,367
I really wanna see some other
side of Shangela,

1361
00:52:32,367 --> 00:52:34,567
and it would be unfortunate
to send her home now.

1362
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,066
- Venus D-Lite.

1363
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:40,800
- She was a sad extra in some
kind of, you know, bad--

1364
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,400
-<i> It's a Horrible Life.</i>

1365
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,834
[laughter]

1366
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,200
Her face is beautiful, but you
can't come out on the challenge

1367
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,166
and the ponytail be the
highlight of your ensemble.

1368
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,567
- That's true.

1369
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:51,233
- Even though the outfit and
everything was very amateurish,

1370
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:53,433
I was hoping she'd redeem
herself with her personality.

1371
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:56,767
But she was inarticulate
and just wasn't engaging.

1372
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:59,567
- Mimi Imfurst!

1373
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,367
Her outfit was a little sloppy,

1374
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:02,834
but it was effective.

1375
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:05,533
- I thought it was hilarious
that she used something that's

1376
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,300
so iconic and turned it into

1377
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,900
something that was flirty
and funny.

1378
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,200
- You know I live for camp drag,

1379
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,066
but I'm really concerned that
that's her shtick

1380
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,166
and that's what she falls on.

1381
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,300
I wanna see if she can do
something else.

1382
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,300
- Raja.
How 'bout that?

1383
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,433
- She brings couture
and a sense of ownership

1384
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,800
as soon as she stepped out
on the runway.

1385
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,200
- Yes.

1386
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,066
- And then the delight was
watching her drop to the ground

1387
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,066
and being fun.

1388
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:29,767
And that was
a great combination.

1389
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:32,700
- I did wish she would project
her voice a little more

1390
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,700
and kind of be a little more
in your face.

1391
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,700
- Right, you not just look like
a supermodel...

1392
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,633
- Act like one.

1393
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,734
- Silence!

1394
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:45,433
Bring back my girls.

1395
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,900
Welcome back, ladies.

1396
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,500
Let's get down to it.

1397
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,200
Mimi Imfurst.

1398
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,200
You showed us
that big girls do cry.

1399
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:06,433
Now I'm really gonna give you
something to cry about.

1400

Condragulatons.
You're safe.

1401
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:12,133
- Thank you.
Thank you.

1402
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,100
I just couldn't believe it.

1403
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,433
I was for sure I was
in the bottom two.

1404
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:21,834
I was for sure.

1405
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:24,200
- Manila Luzon.

1406
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,066

You're safe.
Condragulations.

Venus...

1409
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:38,133
you were outshined
on the runway.

1410
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:42,300
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1411
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,300
- When Ru said I was
in the bottom two, I was...

1412
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,600
I was devastated.

1413
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,100
- Raja.

1414
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:57,467
With your photo, fashion,
and frolic in the snow...

1415
00:54:57,467 --> 00:55:00,667
you are the queen
who stole Christmas.

That's SequinQueen.com.

1423
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,667
- I'm so proud of myself.

1424
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:28,500
I worked really hard, and
I was really focused about this.

1425
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,800
And it feels really great.

1426
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:40,400
- Carmen Carrera, you have
the body of death...

1427
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,367
but do you have the killer
instinct it takes to win?

1428
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,500
Shangela, I've given you
a second chance,

1429
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,367
but your holiday presentation
left us a little frosty.

1430
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:58,467
Carmen, you're safe.

1431
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,700
- Thank you.

1432
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:06,133
- Shangela, my dear,

1433
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:09,467
you are up for elimination.

1434
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,200
- I'm in disbelief.

1435
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,500
A year later,
and here I am again,

1436
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
in the bottom two.

1437
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,767
- Two queens stand before me.

Prior to tonight,
you were asked

1439
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,133

1441

00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:33,533
to save yourself
from elimination.

1443
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,567

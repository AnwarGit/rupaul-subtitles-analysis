Sharon, she has
one good character,

10
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,233
so she might as well
use it.

11
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,934

with Phi Phi?

12
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:26,400

towards the judges.

and the bra strap.

the first girl home.

"high class,"

pageant queens

as my default partner?

122
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,533
&gt;&gt; Oh, and one little detail.

123
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,934
Instead of doing
your own makeup,

124
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:28,200
you'll be responsible for
painting your partner's face.

125
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,700
&gt;&gt; Oh, God!
&gt;&gt; Oh!

&gt;&gt; Oh, and one more thing.

128
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,767

to each other.

143
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,867
&gt;&gt; Being handcuffed

144
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,066

something out of my bag.

148
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,567
I have a great idea
for a mug shot.

149
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,700
Madame's just like,
"Okay, I have ideas too,"

150
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,066
and I'm like,
"Well, we'll use mine."

151
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,066
Put this blue paint
on your face.

152
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,767
Take it and, like,
splotch it on me.

153
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,767
&gt;&gt; Okay.

155
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,867

&gt;&gt; Oh, that's the blue stuff.

162
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:58,967
&gt;&gt; It's a dye pack.

163
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,066
&gt;&gt; Of course, the dye pack.

164
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,133
&gt;&gt; One, two, three--

165

&gt;&gt; Oh!
Oh, dear!

173
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,600
You might need a breathalyzer,
honey.

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
&gt;&gt; It's not my first time
at the rodeo.

175
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,567
&gt;&gt; Deliverance!

176
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,967
Serving time!

177
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,400
Attica!

178
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,734
Excuse my beauty.

179
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,367
I was framed!

180
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,433
May I call you
Missy Misdemeanor?

181
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,667
&gt;&gt; Don't drop the soap!

183
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,233
Serving time!

184
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,734
Salvation!

185
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,266
Child, you are serving some
Raggedy Ann realness.

186
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,066
It must be 5:00 somewhere,

187
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,934
because you got the shadow,
girl.

188
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,200
&gt;&gt; [coughs]

189
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
[laughs]

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,934
&gt;&gt; Acquittal!

191
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:56,066
Bad boys!

192
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,433
&gt;&gt; What you gonna do?

193
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,100
&gt;&gt; That's right, honey.

194
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,934
&gt;&gt; Busted!

195
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,400
All right, girl.

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,433
If the wig don't fit,
you can't acquit.

197
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,834
All right,
that's a wrap...

198
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,533
sheet.

199
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,900
The verdict is in.

200
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,734
One pair is guilty of being
sickening in the first degree.

201
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:22,066
The winners of today's
mini challenge are...

202
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,467
Willam and Madame LaQueer.

203
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,200
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Whoo!

204
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,934
[applause and laughter]

205
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:29,066
&gt;&gt; Condragulations, girls.

206
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,900
Hollywood is a tough town.

207
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
One day, you're a big star,

208
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
and the next day,
you can't get arrested.

209
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
Today, you get to be both.

210
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,567
For this week's main challenge,

211
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:45,300
you'll be starring in the new
TV sitcom,<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>

212
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,266
&gt;&gt; A sitcom challenge
is my day job.

213
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,300
Come on.

214
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I was like, sitcoms?

215
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,433
Oh, check.

216
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:53,066
&gt;&gt; It's about four best
squirrel friends

217
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,934
who keep getting arrested
and sent to jail.

218
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,200
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

219
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,300
&gt;&gt; This acting challenge is
really exciting for me

220
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
because I have
a degree in acting.

221
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,967
This is my moment.

222
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,633
&gt;&gt; You'll be competing
in two groups.

223
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,533
Willam, Madame LaQueer,

224
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,700
since you won
the mini challenge,

225
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,433
you'll be team captains.

226
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:16,100
&gt;&gt; Finally, I'm not gonna get
picked last.

227
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,066
&gt;&gt; Now, to choose your cast,

228
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,800
you'll be drawing names
from this iron fist shoe box,

229
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,066
which normally holds shoes
designed by yours truly.

230
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:29,467
Madame LaQueer, you go first.

231
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,166
&gt;&gt; Dida Ritz.

232
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,800
&gt;&gt; Cheesecake, yeah.

233
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,633
&gt;&gt; Jiggly.

234
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,600
&gt;&gt; Sharon Needles.

235
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,633
&gt;&gt; Latrice.

236
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,233
&gt;&gt; ♪ Ooh hoo ♪

237
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,100
&gt;&gt; Kenya Michaels.

238
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,500
&gt;&gt; Phi Phi.

239
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,433
&gt;&gt; Milan.

240
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,300
&gt;&gt; Milan goes to Madame LaQueer,

241
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,734
which of course means
that Chad Michaels

242
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,200
goes to Willam's team.

243
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
Willam, Madame LaQueer,

244
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,166
you are in charge
of assigning the parts.

245
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,700
I'll leave you
to learn your lines.

246
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,467
Gentlemen, start your engines,

247
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,200
and may the best woman win.

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,233
&gt;&gt; All right, you'll be Karen,

249
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll be Charlotte, uh,

250
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,066
you'll be Julia, and...

251
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,633
Kenya is performing Marge,
the guard

252
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,734
because it's just so funny

253
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:18,700
to see such a butch so small.

254
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,800
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God,
Kenya's so fishy,

255
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,867
I don't even think she know how
to be butch.

256
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,367
&gt;&gt; Okay, we gotta do
a quick read.

257
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,934
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison,
pretty ladies.

258
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:32,367
Says here you were arrested for
soliciting a "meenor."

259
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,867
&gt;&gt; Minor.
&gt;&gt; Minor, a minor.

260
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:34,967
&gt;&gt; [clears throat]

261
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,867
&gt;&gt; When you're in
a group challenge,

262
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,467
everyone's work reflects on you.

263
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,233
Go over this word with me
a couple times.

264
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,233
Tuckahoe.

265
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,233
&gt;&gt; Tuckahoe, tuckahoe.

266
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,100
&gt;&gt; Slower, tuck-a-hoe.

267
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
&gt;&gt; Tuckahoe, okay.

268
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,133
&gt;&gt; Soliciting.

269
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,433
&gt;&gt; Soliciting a "meenor".
&gt;&gt; A minor.

270
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,433
&gt;&gt; Minor, minor, okay.

271
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,867
&gt;&gt; Are you gonna let her
take over this?

272
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,400
Are you gonna let her direct?

273
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,867
&gt;&gt; Girl, are you gonna keep
telling me

274
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,567
what I am going to do
with my group?

275
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,767
If she wants it her own way,

276
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,100
then she can win
a mini challenge

277
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,233
and then direct the group.

278
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,900
&gt;&gt; I have to wear the tights
with this?

279
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,233
&gt;&gt; Our main challenge today
is acting in a sitcom

280
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,533
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>

281
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,133
He said, "Screw it."

282
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,300
I thought I just did!

283
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,233
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

284
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,100
&gt;&gt; For me, it's a day job.

285
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm cool.

286
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,367
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Tuckahoe
Prison for Ladies.

287
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:28,266
As soon as I saw that there was
a prison guard,

288
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,433
I knew that's
the role for me.

289
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,533
Well, hello, gorgeous.

290
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,567
I'll let you hide in my hedges
any day.

291
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,400
&gt;&gt; I beg your pardon,
but I'm not into horticulture.

292
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,033
What the fuck Is
horticulture?

293
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,200
&gt;&gt; It's the study of plants.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

294
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
I don't know what that means.

296
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,333
That's an S.A.T. Word.

297
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,467
&gt;&gt;<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>

298
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,834
That's the words
you're punching.

299
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,934
"I'm," 'cause that's you.

300
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,967
&gt;&gt; But I'm not into
horticulture.

301
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,767
&gt;&gt;<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>

302
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,834
What are the most important
words in that sentence?

303
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:57,867
&gt;&gt; I beg your pardon?

304
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,000
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you did it great.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,266
&gt;&gt; Leh-leh-leh-lah.

306
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,767
&gt;&gt; I've been on sitcoms,
and I know about comedy.

307
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,700
Take your note and move on.

308
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,934
I beg your pardon?

309
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,300
&gt;&gt; Just copy that.

310
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,066
Copy exactly how she said it.
&gt;&gt; Exactly how they said it.

311
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,066
&gt;&gt; I beg your pardon?

312
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,600
&gt;&gt; But I'm not
into horticulture.

313
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
&gt;&gt; But I'm<i> not</i>
into horticulture.

314
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,834
&gt;&gt; Maybe I'll give Rose, like,

315
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,600
a Audrey from
<i>Little Shop of Horrors</i><span style="bodyStyle"> voice.</i>

316
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,133
This challenge is comedic
and character-driven.

317
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,166
I'm just starting to think

318
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,934
every challenge
is my kind of challenge.

319
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:32,967
&gt;&gt; I thought you said it was
a Justin Beaver--fuck.

320
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,967
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.
Hell no.

321
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,300
&gt;&gt; The other group,
it's weird.

322
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,333
Sharon is talking like

323
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,934
she has something
stuck in her throat.

324
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:41,867
And it's like,
country bumpkin cartoon.

325
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,967
&gt;&gt; It's a little tighter
than I expected.

326
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,867
&gt;&gt; An oversized beaver
rubbing up against her kid?

327
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,767
I wonder why she got upset?

328
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,200
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

329
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,633
Are we talking about beavers?

330
00:11:55,633 --> 00:12:00,767
Uh...oh!

331
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,333
&gt;&gt; Are you doing an accent?

332
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,533
&gt;&gt; Yes, I've got
a British accent.

333
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,300
&gt;&gt; It's a little distracting.

334
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,600
Like, I think it might be a
little distracting to the text,

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,934
but that's your choice.

336
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:15,467
&gt;&gt; I'm an actor, and I know
how to portray a character,

337
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,166
and that's actually my strength.

338
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,667
I asked the young man
next to me for his napkin

339
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:26,233
to wipe my friend's
sticky beaver.

340
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,100
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.

341
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,934
That's gonna be stupid.

342
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:33,767
[laughs]

343
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,133
&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello!

344
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,066
&gt;&gt; Hi, how are you?

345
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,667
&gt;&gt; I smell Emmy.

346
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,700
[laughter]

347
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,467
&gt;&gt; Whoo, that's correct, mama.

348
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,500
&gt;&gt; Hey, kids.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

349
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
&gt;&gt; Hello.

350
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,667
&gt;&gt; Team Willam, you have a lot

351
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,066
of TV experience, don't you?

352
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,266
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you name a cop show
in the past ten years,

353
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,734
I've probably been on it.

354
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,066
&gt;&gt; And what role
are you playing?

355
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,066
&gt;&gt; Karen.

356
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,266
&gt;&gt; Oh, is that the slutty one?

357
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,433
&gt;&gt; She's man crazy.

358
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,600
[laughter]

359
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,333
&gt;&gt; And why'd you choose that
for yourself?

360
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,633
&gt;&gt; I'm very Samantha,

361
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,133
and I was on<i> Sex and the City</i>
with Samantha,

362
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,133
so that kind of works.

363
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,200
&gt;&gt; Really?

364
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,066
&gt;&gt; That's what you gotta do.

365
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,934
That's what you gotta do, honey.

366
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,934
&gt;&gt; Latrice, you are playing...

367
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,633
&gt;&gt; Large Marge.
&gt;&gt; The prison guard.

368
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:18,233
Now, are you drawing this
from personal experience?

369
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,066
&gt;&gt; The tables are turned, baby.

370
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:24,367
[laughter]

371
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,066
&gt;&gt; And Jiggly,
what role are you playing?

372
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,233
&gt;&gt; I get to play Charlotte.

373
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,200
&gt;&gt; Is that the prissy one?

374
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,834
&gt;&gt; The prissy one.

375
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,800
&gt;&gt; Now, that--I would never
cast you as the prissy one.

376
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
&gt;&gt; She said it.

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,667
I asked,
"Who do you identify with?"

378
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,233
&gt;&gt; I mean, like,
I have my moments,

379
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:41,834
so, you know, there's things
that I'm just like, eww.

380
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,500
&gt;&gt; Okay.

381
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,800
I want to hear how Jiggly
gets prissy.

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,066
&gt;&gt; I beg your pardon?

383
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,900
But I'm not into horticulture.

384
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,834
&gt;&gt; Jiggly, I think you could use
a little bit more work

385
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:02,900
of identifying
who your character is.

386
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,867
She's not really angry.

387
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,567
She's more prissy.

388
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,800
You got to commit to it;
you got to nail it.

389
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,100
&gt;&gt; Okay?
&gt;&gt; Okay.

390
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
&gt;&gt; All right, kids,
get back to work.

391
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I can't wait to see it.

392
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,567
It's very funny already.

393
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,333
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ru.
&gt;&gt; All right, good.

394
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,433
Team Madame LaQueer.

395
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,400
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ru.

396
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,066
&gt;&gt; Madame, are you
a good director?

397
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,533
&gt;&gt; I wrote and direct
a play myself twice.

398
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,767
&gt;&gt; Oh, boy.

399
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,433
Milan, you're an actor.

400
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,400
How is Madame LaQueer
as a director?

401
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,133
&gt;&gt; Um, I think she's a little
laid back.

402
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,900
She could be
a little bit more directorial

403
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,567
with her approach

404
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,900
but, uh, we seem to be doing
a great job.

405
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,300
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, all right.

406
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,066
Sharon Needles,
what role are you playing?

407
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,333
&gt;&gt; Rose the idiot.

408
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,133
&gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness.

409
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,533
And Madame LaQueer.

410
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,066
&gt;&gt; Charlotte.

411
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,800
&gt;&gt; Madame LaQueer prissy?

412
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,667
That's gonna be quite
a stretch for you, isn't it?

413
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,700
Wow.

414
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,100
Kenya, what role
are you playing?

415
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,600
&gt;&gt; Marge.

416
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,967
&gt;&gt; You're the butch
prison guard?

417
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,700
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
Yeah.

418
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,066
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting choice.

419
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,066
Who made that choice?

420
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:12,100
&gt;&gt; I did.

421
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
&gt;&gt; You made that choice.

422
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,734
&gt;&gt; Yes.

423
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,900
I assigned the roles.

424
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,867
&gt;&gt; Okay.

425
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,900
All right, all right.

426
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,934
I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.

427
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,300
Remember that comedy
is precision.

428
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,967
Find the cohesive rhythm
together.

429
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm sure you're gonna
work it out.

430
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,934
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All right.

431
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,533
Gather 'round, ladykins.

432
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,433
Later, on the set of
your sitcom,

433
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:40,500
we'll be joined by our
extra special guest judge,

434
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,400
the Emmy-award-winning
co-creator of<i> Will &amp; Grace,</i>

435
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Max Mutchnick.

436
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,467
&gt;&gt; Oh!
&gt;&gt; Cool.

437
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,467
[applause]

438
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,600
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,900
&gt;&gt; Max Mutchnick,
he's a star-maker.

440
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,233
&gt;&gt; Break a leg and...

441
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,633
don't fuck It up.

442
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,567
All right, see you later.

443
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,066
&gt;&gt; Bye, Ru.
&gt;&gt; Bye, Ru.

444
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,867
&gt;&gt; I couldn't be more thrilled
that Max Mutchnick is here,

445
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,433
because I've auditioned
for him before,

446
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,400
and I haven't gotten the job,

447
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,533
so I'd like a second chance.

448
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,467
&gt;&gt; Jail scene, take one.

449
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,767
&gt;&gt; Action.

450
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,667
&gt;&gt; Ladies, no one needs to
go to jail for liking nuts.

451
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,834
Why, I have a huge sack.

452
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,200
&gt;&gt; Oh, me first, gimme.

453
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.

454
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,066
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like mine raw.

455
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:24,967
&gt;&gt; Wait a second,

456
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,500
are we still talking
about peanuts?

457
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,467
&gt;&gt; Cut.

458
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,166
Jiggly, wait a second.

459
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,333
&gt;&gt; Wait a second.

460
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,834
Are we still talking
about peanuts?

461
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,633
&gt;&gt; Wait a second, period.

462
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:36,066
Are we still talking
about peanuts?

463
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,633
There's a period there.

464
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,467
&gt;&gt; Wait a second.

465
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,867
Are we still talking
about peanuts?

466
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,166
Eww!

467
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,066
&gt;&gt; You know, it--yeah.

468
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:48,567
Let's just keep going.

469
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:49,934
Action.

470
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,500
&gt;&gt; Rose, what in the world are
you doing in that crazy get-up?

471
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,200
When the security guards
were chasing me,

472
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,700
the only thing I could find
to hide in

473
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
was this Mr. Happy uniform.

474
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,133
&gt;&gt; Well, that's you in
a nutshell, Rose.

475
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,967
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

476
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,333
&gt;&gt; And cut.

477
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,533
&gt;&gt; Chad, you're a pro.

478
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,900
You've obviously been doing it
for 3,000 years.

479
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,934
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

480
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,867
&gt;&gt; It's really working for me,
okay?

481
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

482
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,734
&gt;&gt; Ooh, me first, gimme.

483
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,066
&gt;&gt; William.
&gt;&gt; Willam.

484
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,533
&gt;&gt; Willam, thank you.

485
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:17,967
&gt;&gt; It's spelled right
on my headshot.

486
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,066
It's in there, so it's just
on the way out.

487
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,467
&gt;&gt; So, "William," it's just,

488
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,467
make sure you get all the words
in there and--

489
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:27,100
&gt;&gt; Why don't you correct Ru
when he says "William"?

490
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,967
&gt;&gt; He's got a $100,000 check.

491
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,600
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's right, okay.

492
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,633
You make a good point.

493
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,433
&gt;&gt; Yes.

494
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,233
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.

495
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,367
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like mine raw.

496
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,500
&gt;&gt; Get those nuts
away from my face.

497
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,133
&gt;&gt; Latrice, have a good time.

498
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

499
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,567
&gt;&gt; "Get those nuts away
from my face,"

500
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,066
and then give--
look at the camera.

501
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,066
There you go.

502
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,066
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

503
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,433
&gt;&gt; I mean, you give us--
I mean, honey,

504
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,900
you could do that
for a half an hour,

505
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,934
and they would laugh.

506
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,433
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna let you have
it now.

507
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,700
Okay.

508
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,667
&gt;&gt; There you go.

509
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,433
[laughter]

510
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,400
Action.

511
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,133
&gt;&gt; Get those nuts
away from my face.

512
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,567
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

513
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,967
&gt;&gt; I was really tapping into
some serious acting skills there

514
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,500
because Marge
doesn't like nuts...

515
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,533
but Latrice does.

516
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,767
[laughs]

517
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,300
&gt;&gt; That's a series.

518
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,667
Latrice in<i> Get Those Nuts Away</i>
<i>From My Face,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this fall.</i>

519
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,734
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

520
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,633
&gt;&gt; Our main challenge today
is to act in a sitcom

521
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,700
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>

522
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,900
&gt;&gt; Action.

523
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,133
&gt;&gt; Of all the stupid things.

524
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,867
Rose, why did you show up
at the Justin Bieber concert

525
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,800
in this ridiculous costume?

526
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,567
&gt;&gt; Justin bie--oh.

527
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,800
I thought you said we were going
to a just--

528
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Fuck.

529
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
&gt;&gt; You can't do that on TV.

530
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,533
&gt;&gt; No, I know.

531
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,066
I'm really good with dialogue.

532
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,567
It's just a real tongue-twister.

533
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,533
&gt;&gt; All right, so you want to
just pick it up from--

534
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,633
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll pick it up again,

535
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,567
and we'll have no problems
this time.

536
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,834
&gt;&gt; Rose, why did you show up
at a Justin Bieber concert

537
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,867
in this ridiculous costume?

538
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,400
&gt;&gt; Oh, I thought you said

539
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,800
we were going to a dress
in beaver cos--gone--

540
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,066
God, that's a fucking hard line.

541
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,367
&gt;&gt; No F words.

542
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,433
And can we just make sure
that when you do that line--

543
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,467
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a hard line.

544
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:09,967
I'm saying "dressed in beaver."

545
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,367
&gt;&gt; Sharon keeps talking back.

546
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,100
&gt;&gt; It's kind of
a hard thing to hear.

547
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,800
&gt;&gt; I was like, girl, you need to
calm yourself down real quick.

548
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,633
&gt;&gt; Please don't make me go
through that line again.

549
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,834
&gt;&gt; Action.

550
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,066
&gt;&gt; When was the last time
you washed this thing?

551
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,533
I mean, I nearly gagged
at the stench.

552
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:31,266
&gt;&gt; Mmm, I kind of like
the smell.

553
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:36,967
Remind me
of high school gym class.

554
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,066
&gt;&gt; Cut.

555
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,066
You were doing a one-woman
show out there.

556
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,500
You just seemed like
a crazy person

557
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,633
that's talking to yourself.

558
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,734
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

559
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,400
&gt;&gt; I nearly gagged on that--
on that stench.

560
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,767
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I kind of
like the smell.

561
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:50,734
&gt;&gt; Cut.

562
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,934
Kenya, you like
the smell of the beaver,

563
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,767
so don't hold your nose.

564
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,700
You love the beaver.

565
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,533
&gt;&gt; I wonder why
she got so upset?

566
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,433
&gt;&gt; It was just
a big old country boy.

567
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,500
I mean, that young man
looked pretty mature enough

568
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,734
to handle a beaver on his own.

569
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,066
&gt;&gt; Milan, it's "mama's boy,"
not "country boy."

570
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,100
&gt;&gt; I wonder why
she got so upset?

571
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,266
&gt;&gt; He was just
a big old country boy.

572
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:14,533
&gt;&gt; Cut.

573
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,800
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

574
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I mean, that young man looked
pretty mature enough

575
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,600
to handle a beaver
on his own.

576
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,500
&gt;&gt; Um, Milan, Milan,
you're kind of

577
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,066
playing to stuff out here.

578
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,066
Be in the scene
with these people.

579
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,200
Look at the person
that you're talking to.

580
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,066
&gt;&gt; It is extremely intimidating
to have the creator

581
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,266
of<i> Will &amp; Grace</i><span style="bodyStyle"> critique you.</i>

582
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:39,133
I thought this evening
was kind of thrilling.

583
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,734
Me and this oversized beaver.

584
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,367
&gt;&gt; Milan's not exciting enough.

585
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:48,100
I didn't want to see
more of her.

586
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,333
I didn't really care.

587
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,567
&gt;&gt; Action.

588
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,000
&gt;&gt; And then his mother told me

589
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,967
to get my tail out of his face,

590
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,700
and then she really
let me have it.

591
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,200
&gt;&gt; Gee, a sloppy, oversized
beaver rubbing against her kid.

592
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,433
I wonder why she got so upset?

593
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,367
&gt;&gt; Cut, print, Emmy.

594
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,633
You know how to do a sitcom.

595
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,734
It's what you dream of,

596
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,400
when you're writing
this kind of stuff,

597
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
that you come across an actress
who just takes the stuff,

598
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,567
takes it to a better place,

599
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,100
and it's really wonderful
to watch.

600
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,066
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

601
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,333
I feel, like, tears almost
coming

602
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,133
'cause I'm doing exactly
what I prayed for,

603
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,967
just to redeem myself.

604
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:21,967
&gt;&gt; Action.

605
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,467
&gt;&gt; That was so mortifying.

606
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,533
I "actudentially" spilled a--
ah-la-la-la.

607
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,200
I "actudentially" spilled
a virgin Mary on Rose,

608
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,934
so I asked the, uh, oh!

609
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:33,967
&gt;&gt; Cut.

610
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,066
It's a bloody mary,
not a virgin mary.

611
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,633
&gt;&gt; Okay.

612
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,467
&gt;&gt; And I asked this young man
next to me for a--

613
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,433
Oh.

614
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,567
I'm gonna go again, sorry.

615
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,066
&gt;&gt; LaQueer,
it's really important

616
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,800
that you listen to the director,
okay?

617
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,166
When you make a mistake,

618
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,767
and you're in front of
a live audience,

619
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,934
you got to keep going.

620
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,700
You keep stopping as if
you're allowed to stop.

621
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,333
There is no stopping.

622
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,300
&gt;&gt; So I asked the young man next
to me for a napkin

623
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,767
so I can wipe my friend's
hairy beav--

624
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,700
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

625
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,834
Ouch.

626
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,200
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

627
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,200
We are talking about beavers
or--ew!

628
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,166
&gt;&gt; Can you do the "ew"
as Lucille Ball, though?

629
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,767
Ewwwwww!

630
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,433
Do it like that.

631
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,133
&gt;&gt; Ewwwwww!

632
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,700
&gt;&gt; Ewwwwwwww!

633
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,233
&gt;&gt; Ewwwww!

634
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,367
&gt;&gt; Ewwwwwww!

635
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,100
&gt;&gt; Ewwwww!

636
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,734
&gt;&gt; Ewwwwwwww!

637
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:31,834
&gt;&gt; Ewwwwww!

638
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,633
&gt;&gt; That is a wrap.

639
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,066
Nice work, ladies.

640
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:39,300
Tomorrow, you'll sitcoms will
premiered on the main stage,

641
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,900
where we will be joined by
one of my favorite funny ladies.

642
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,200

643
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
&gt;&gt; Oh, I love her.

645
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,166
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God, I'm so happy

646
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,367
Nicole Sullivan's
gonna be a judge.

647
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,133
I can't wait.

648
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,233
All right, ladies.

649
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,867
We will see you tomorrow.

650
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:57,867
All right, here we go.

651
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:00,100
all: Bye.

652
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
[alarm beeps]

653
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:10,567
&gt;&gt; "Mornking."

654
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,867
&gt;&gt; All right.

655
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,600
&gt;&gt; All right, time to work.

656
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,367
&gt;&gt; Hello, boo-boo.

657
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,633
&gt;&gt; So were you guys
sweating it up

658
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,266
in that jail cell yesterday?

659
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,266
Any flashbacks in there?

660
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,333
&gt;&gt; I tell you this,

661
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,266
it was nice to be
on the other side of it

662
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,734
for a change,
you know what I mean?

663
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,133
Being in prison gave me
that opportunity

664
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,266
to, like, think about
what my dreams were.

665
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,367
And you know what?

666
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,633
Your choices are to accept it
and move on,

667
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,700
or to beat yourself
up over it.

668
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,433
Everybody makes mistakes,

669
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:38,934
but, bitch, you better look
sickening when you get up.

670
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:43,266
Sickening,
and make them eat it.

671
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:46,133
&gt;&gt; Latrice,
can you take us to church?

this point.

&gt;&gt; It's a pageant for my life.

684
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,066
Every day I'm up for it,
I think "pageant."

685
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,600
&gt;&gt; What I said about Phi Phi
on the runway last week

686
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,533
makes me feel bad.

687
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,200
&gt;&gt; Did you work well with
Phi Phi?

688
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,367
&gt;&gt; She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.

689
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,533
Basically what she said is,

690
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:28,200
"You're spooky,
dress like a monster."

691
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,934
&gt;&gt; Come talk to me for a minute.

692
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,700
&gt;&gt; What's up?

693
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,166
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if
any of the other girls

694
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,433
have said anything about it,

695
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,500
but I'd rather have you hear
it from me now

696
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,300
before it turns into
much bigger than it was,

697
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,900
but in the last runway, um,

698
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,066
I was pretty sure I was
in the bottom two.

699
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,100
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

700
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,066
&gt;&gt; So I brought you up,

701
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,333
and I just wanted to
let you know.

702
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,400
&gt;&gt; What do you mean,
brought me up?

703
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,700
Brought me up, how?

704
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,133
&gt;&gt; Well, basically,
what I said was,

705
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:57,700
I felt that you kind of
pushed me into, you know,

706
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,767
just doing my spooky look
and that it was irresponsible,

707
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,467
and I thought
it was kind of sloppy, just to--

708
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,433
&gt;&gt; Because I told you to do
something that you're good at?

709
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:09,200
&gt;&gt; Well, I wanted RuPaul to know
that if she wanted to say

710
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,233
that I just kept turning out
the same look,

711
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:15,633
it was because you just wanted
us to be what we always are.

712
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,967
&gt;&gt; You're an adult.

713
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,567
You could have came up to me
and said, "You know what?

714
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,600
I don't want to do this."

715
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
&gt;&gt; I was being realistic.

716
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
&gt;&gt; Realistic is bullshit,

717
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,066
because I picked out a character
for you

718
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,333
to sit there and do,
and you did it great.

719
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,066
You obviously won
the goddamn challenge.

720
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,066
&gt;&gt; Because--because--

721
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,100
&gt;&gt; Because of me.

722
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,767
Because I told you
to go in your closet

723
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:33,066
and dig out
that goddamn gothic look.

724
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,934
So congratulations,
you're welcome,

725
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,400
because I was the one
that sat there

726
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,433
and picked that out for you.

727
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,467
&gt;&gt; Okay, well,
if you think that I won

728
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,967
because of you,
you--you are wrong.

729
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,333
&gt;&gt; Then what--
what do you want to do?

730
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,533
&gt;&gt; It's my talent
that gets me to win.

731
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,533
&gt;&gt; Sharon, you know what?

732
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,166
You are not even
on the same level as me,

733
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,200
so get the fuck out of my face.

734
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,433
&gt;&gt; That's right, because you--

735
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,633
&gt;&gt; Get the fuck
out of my face.

736
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,500
Go back and do your only
one look that you got!

737
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,967
&gt;&gt; Oh, I have one look?

738
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:55,266
Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck You.

739
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,300
&gt;&gt; Tired-ass showgirl?

740
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,667
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!

741
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,100
Go back to Party City
where you belong!

742
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,867
&gt;&gt; I'm the fucking
future of drag.

743
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,300
You look fucking 20 years ago.

744
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,767
&gt;&gt; Oh, girl, please.

745
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,433
&gt;&gt; I tried to talk to you
like a sister

746
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,066
and I tried to talk to you
like a grownup.

747
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,133
&gt;&gt; We aren't sisters, though,

748
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,800
so I don't ever want you
talking to me.

749
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,667
&gt;&gt; Whoa, time to go.

750
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,266
&gt;&gt; To sit there
and tarnish my reputation

751
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,433
just because she felt insecure
is bullshit.

752
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,633
Bitch, don't come for me.

753
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,500
&gt;&gt; Future of drag.

754
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,533
Fucking tired-ass lame shit.

755
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:32,166
Future, the future.

Hey, it's that girl,
Michelle Visage.

767
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:08,800
&gt;&gt; You spin me right round,
baby.

&gt;&gt; You look sickening.

771
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,333
&gt;&gt; Thank you, darling.

772
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,433
Max Mutchnick, how are you,
darling?

773
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,800
&gt;&gt; Thrilled, and you get points
for just getting the name right.

774
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,233
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

775
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,934
And Nicole Sullivan.

776
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,533
I'm so glad you're here.

777
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:29,533
Now, what would the Vancome
Lady say about my makeup?

778
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:32,900
&gt;&gt; Looks like Little Orphan
Annie sat in the sun too long

779
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,133
and then got a boob job.

780
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,900
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

781
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,533
Now, this week,
the queens were challenged

782
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,567
to play classic
sitcom character types,

783
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,200
and tonight,
they're all dolled up

784
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,066
for their television premiere.

785
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,233
Gentlemen, start your engines,

786
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,700
and may the best woman win.

787
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,066
&gt;&gt; Up first, Phi Phi O'Hara.

788
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,133
She's so vaginal in white.

789
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,100
&gt;&gt; If I'm gonna go
to red carpet,

790
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,433
I want a gorgeous gown
that everybody's gonna be, like,

791
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,066
"Ooh, that's Phi Phi."

792
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,467
&gt;&gt; I see her halo.

793
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,533
&gt;&gt; And that dress has wings.

794
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,734
Latrice Royale.

795
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:14,700
I see the Beverly Hills, Billy.

796
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,834
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

797
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,433
&gt;&gt; I'm blinging;
I'm feeling beautiful.

798
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:22,233
This is the sheer elegant side
of Latrice.

799
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,066
&gt;&gt; I think Latrice has a
Cable Ace Award up her sleeve.

800
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,567
&gt;&gt; Or she's just happy
to see you.

801
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:29,300
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

802
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,834
Dida Ritz.

803
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,567
Wow, she's on fire.

804
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,934
&gt;&gt; I'm all about showing body
and leg.

805
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:36,767
I am working it.

806
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:39,166
&gt;&gt; She's walking like
she has somewhere to go.

807
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,834
She's got a meeting
in the ladies room.

808
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,567
&gt;&gt; Madame LaQueer as Folk.

809
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,967
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

810
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:48,467
&gt;&gt; I'm going for something
I would actually wear

811
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,567
to a event premiere.

812
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,567
&gt;&gt; Lainie Kazan's sexy sister.

813
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,066
&gt;&gt; Kirstie Alley
better watch out.

814
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:59,166
Willam, serving
a little Taylor Swift.

815
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,333
&gt;&gt; I chose some
Vivienne Westwood

816
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,900
because the only thing that
matters on the red carpet is,

817
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,266
who are you wearing?

818
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,500
&gt;&gt; I love it accidentally
fell off the shoulder.

819
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,700
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

820
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,066
&gt;&gt; "Did my boob fall out?"

821
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:13,467
&gt;&gt; Standards and practices
will hear about this.

822
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:15,867
Lil' Kenya Michaels.

823
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:17,300
&gt;&gt; Work, Lil' Kenya Braxton.

824
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,266
&gt;&gt; Yes.

825
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,867
&gt;&gt; I feel amazing.

826
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:20,900
I'm a model.

827
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,066
This is my moment.

828
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,567
&gt;&gt; A pineapple smoothie.

829
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,300
&gt;&gt; Delicious.

830
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,333
Chad Michaels.

831
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,533
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

832
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,200
&gt;&gt; Very Florence
and the Machine.

833
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,333
&gt;&gt; The dog days are over.

834
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,800
&gt;&gt; I'm wearing a tribute
to the Tudors,

835
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,066
the Renaissance,

836
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,700
and I just felt really gorgeous.

837
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,934
&gt;&gt; Take it all in, darling.

838
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:44,834
Up next, Jiggly Caliente.

839
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,867
&gt;&gt; This is Brooklyn prom,
bitches.

840
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,333
&gt;&gt; The girls that are edgy,
young Hollywood,

841
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,567
they don't wear
evening gowns all the time.

842
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:52,800
This gal looked pretty.

843
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,400
&gt;&gt; It's always jiggly
in Philadelphia.

844
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,233
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

845
00:29:57,233 --> 00:30:00,066
&gt;&gt; London, Paris, Milan.

846
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,500
All righty, man.

847
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,367
She's playing her gold card.

848
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,767
&gt;&gt; It feels like I've been
poured in gold,

849
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,100
and if there was
a female version of the Oscar,

850
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,433
it would be me.

851
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,066
&gt;&gt; She's just a bond girl.

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,233
That's something
that cannot be taught.

1026

&gt;&gt; All right, thank you, Dida.

1027

&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Sharon Needles.

1028
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,500
&gt;&gt; Hello, RuPaul.

1029
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,800
&gt;&gt; Here's my concern.

1030
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,767
The whole thing,
the whole package

1031
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:54,400
is just a little too jarring.

1032
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,567
&gt;&gt; This isn't the first time
I've caused concern

1033
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,233
for being too far
out of the box.

1034
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,333
&gt;&gt; This is a little bit of what
happened yesterday.

1035
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,533
You had something to say

1036
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,467
about everything
that I had to say.

1037
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,066
I need to know that you're gonna
take the notes,

1038
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:10,133
not that you're just going
to say to me,

1039
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,600
"This is just who I am,
and take it or leave it."

1040
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,233
That throws up a flag
for a guy like me.

1041
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,500
&gt;&gt; Ladies, thank you.

1042
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,734
I think we've heard enough.

1043
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:23,500
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,

1044
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,266
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1045
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:27,934
You may leave the stage.

1046
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:30,767
Now, just between us "goils,"

1047
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:31,900
what do you think?

1048
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,333
Lil' Kenya Michaels.

1049
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,166
&gt;&gt; I think she's so, so pretty,

1050
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,066
but it's my least favorite thing
to watch as an actor,

1051
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,300
when they're just
really consumed with

1052
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,166
how they look
instead of how they're acting.

1053
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,066
&gt;&gt; Why were you looking at me
when you said that?

1054
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,734
&gt;&gt; [laughs]
&gt;&gt; Anyway.

1055
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:48,233
&gt;&gt; I think she was miscast in
the entire challenge.

1056
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,533
&gt;&gt; Madame LaQueer was the leader
of that group.

1057
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,066
&gt;&gt; She made some piss-poor
casting choices.

1058
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:56,433
&gt;&gt; Let's move on down to Milan.

1059
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,900
&gt;&gt; Kelly Rowland
better watch out,

1060
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,233
but so should the crazy lady
at Coldwater Park.

1061
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,734
This is a person
that talks to the sky

1062
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,100
and tells imaginary
friends to watch out,

1063
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,133
'cause she's coming.

1064
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,133
&gt;&gt; I was sort of shocked to hear
that she was trained.

1065
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,934
I would have expected someone
who'd been trained a lot

1066
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,500
would have been
a lot more at ease.

1067
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,867
&gt;&gt; All right, moving on down
to the team leader,

1068
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:19,100
Madame LaQueer.

1069
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,066
Well, she decided to give
herself a European accent.

1070
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,734
&gt;&gt; I legitimately thought she
was Russian.

1071
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:25,800
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

1072
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,467
&gt;&gt; This actress was not paying
attention.

1073
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:33,066
She seems like a sweet lady,
but not for show business.

1074
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:35,567
&gt;&gt; All right, moving on
to Dida Ritz.

1075
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:38,734
&gt;&gt; I really was impressed
with the raw skill.

1076
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:42,934

to sound sitcom.

00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,767
I should not be having
to tell a queen

1080
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,200
her hair needs to be bigger

1081
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,934
and her legs
need to have lotion.

1082
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:54,066

exposure to her,

kind of quirky and cool.

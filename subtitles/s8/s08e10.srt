-Wow.
-[laughs]

217
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,967
Work it out for team humble.

[cheers and applause]

219
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,934
Now, while you catch
your breath,

220
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,166
let‘s talk to the judges.

221
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,100
Michelle Visage,
what‘d you think?

222
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,934
That was amazing.

223
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:06,133
Come on, choreography.

224
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,400
Phenomenal.
I‘m so proud of you.

225
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,066
And I love that you play safe.

226
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,834
Every one of your dancers
was wearing a hard hat.

227
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,400
I love that.
[laughter]

228
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,333
It‘s important.

229
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,166
I think you need to change
your name to Bob The Superstar.

230
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,633
Ooh.

231
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,233
Well, thank you, judges.

232
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,500
Now, Bob The Drag Queen,

233
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,967
from the moment
you entered the workroom

234
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,533
you had uniqueness, nerve,

235
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,433
and talent written all over you.

236
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,600
Let‘s take a look.

237
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,266
<i>-[Bob] My name is</i>
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>

238
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:38,200
<i>I‘m hilarious, beautiful,</i>
<i>talented, and humble.</i>

239
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,900
<i>That‘s the biggest</i>
<i>pearl necklace I‘ve ever seen.</i>

240
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,500
-How you doing, RuPaul?
-[laughs]

241
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,900
I‘m sorry that I‘m late,

242
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,533
but "Uzo Abubu"
left the stage.

243
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,233
[laughing]

244
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:55,867
Well, then why did I waste
my time putting on this?

245
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,166
Oh, there‘s more.
This.

246
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,533
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.

247
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,934
<i>-[Bob] Insert shady</i>
<i>rattlesnake noise here.</i>

248
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:06,100
[rolls tongue]

249
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,567
-Bob, how‘s your head?
-No complaints.

250
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,400
<i>-[Bob] I‘m Bob The Drag Queen,</i>
<i>a queen for the people.</i>

251
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,066
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

252
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,100
[cheers and applause]

253
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,333
Now, Bob, when did you first
become aware of drag?

254
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,133
I used to watch
"To Wong Foo."

255
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,100
Yas!

256
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,300
I saw, like, this, like,
glamazonian, like,

257
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,667
goddess coming down
from the ceiling

258
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,100
wearing a big confederate flag.

259
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,834
I was like,
"Oh, this bitch is--"

260
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,066
when I say bitch,
I mean it, like,

261
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:41,066
the way you‘d call
your grandmother a bitch.

262
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,500
[laughter]

263
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,066
I was like, "This bitch

264
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,133
is pushing buttons, girl,"
and I loved it.

265
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,166
You excelled at so many
of the challenges.

266
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,867
Did you study the show
before you came on?

267
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:56,066
No,
I‘m just really talented.

268
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,166
[laughter]

269
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,300
You know, listen,

270
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,166
this is my favorite show.

271
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,100
This is what I thought I was
supposed to be doing

272
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,066
my whole life.
When I was performing in,

273
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,834
like, bars in New York City,

274
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,066
dodging beer bottles
literally,

275
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:11,967
I was like,
"This doesn‘t feel right.

276
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,066
There‘s something bigger
coming."

277
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,333
Lo and behold,
I found something bigger.

278
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,400
Her name is RuPaul,
and she blessed me.

279
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,967
[cheers and applause]

280
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,066
Now, Bob, at one point
in the season

281
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,300
the other queens
were rooting for you to fail.

282
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,400
-Mm-hmm.
-What did that feel like?

283
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
It felt like
I was doing it right.

284
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,567
[laughs]

285
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:35,100
I mean, no one‘s rooting
for the person doing the worst.

286
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
No one‘s like, "Oh, you‘re doing
bad. You should get out."

287
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,900
They‘re like,
"Ooh, she‘s doing so well.

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,066
Get her the fuck
out of here."

289
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,200
All right,
so we‘ve got some

290
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,567
fan questions over there.

291
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,834
[cheers and applause]

292
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:53,200
Hallelu, I‘m back,
RuPaul!

293
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,867
[laughter]

294
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,233
Tucker from Florida
wants to know,

295
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,066
"Does your humor come

296
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,934
from overcoming
a dark place in your life?"

297
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,266
Um, see, I mean,
I have the struggles

298
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,867
that a lot of y‘all homosexuals
here had, especially--

299
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:11,433
What?
They‘re--wait, wait--

300
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,533
They‘re--this--

301
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,934
[laughter]

302
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,800
These are homosexuals?

303
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,066
A few.

304
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,233
I had the same hardships
that everyone else here has,

305
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,834
and we all deal with it
in different ways.

306
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,066
If you find something
to filter your pain

307
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,433
and your anger into,
it‘ll flourish.

308
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,934
It really will.

309
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,600
Thank you, Shangela.

310
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,266
Now, Bob,
you blew everyone away

311
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,467
with your Snatch Game
impersonations.

312
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:42,066
Now, did you ever hear
from Uzo or Carol Channing?

313
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, Uzo
tweeted at me

314
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,934
and was like,
"This was amazing,"

315
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,066
and I was like, "Thank you,"

316
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,066
and I am obsessed
with Carol Channing,

317
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,300
but she‘s just--she‘s 95.

318
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
It‘s hard to get
out of the house when you‘re 95.

319
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
I‘m 18, and it‘s hard
for me to get out, so.

320
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,200
Yeah, I know, I know.

321
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,100
Well, we did hear from
the one and only Carol Channing.

322
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,233
Take a look.

323
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,967
<i>Thank you, Bob,</i>

324
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:07,433
<i>for your colorful</i>
<i>impersonation of me.</i>

325
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:12,900
<i>I‘m so honored</i>
<i>to be a part of your history.</i>

326
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,367
<i>Oh, I‘m proud of that.</i>

327
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,533
[cheers and applause]

328
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,066
Oh, my God.

329
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,400
Yes.

330
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
So Bob, I know your brother‘s
over there, right?

331
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,834
Yeah, he‘s the one who‘s just
a shade darker than me.

332
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,400
I‘m 11:00.
He‘s midnight.

333
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,066
[laughter]

334
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,166
Justin, what was it
like growing up with Bob?

335
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,066
Bob used to cry
on my birthdays

336
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,300
‘cause it wasn‘t about him.

337
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,533
That‘s true.
That‘s true.

338
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,166
Now, Bob,
I know that your mother

339
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,133
couldn‘t be here
because of her health.

340
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,066
-Yes.
-Darn, you know,

341
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,367
it would have been
a great opportunity for us

342
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,133
to have a taped message
or something,

343
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,900
but we didn‘t--we don‘t have--
wait a minute.

344
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,066
Oh, actually,
we do have a taped message.

345
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,400
- Oh.
- Let‘s roll that.

346
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,633
- Hey.
-<i> Bob, this is your mother.</i>

347
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,367
<i>I‘m very proud of you.</i>

348
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,200
<i>I‘ve always believed in you,</i>

349
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,433
<i>even when you didn‘t</i>
<i>believe in yourself.</i>

350
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,867
<i>Continue to work hard</i>
<i>on your craft.</i>

351
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,066
<i>Always respect your fans.</i>

352
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,367
<i>Reach for the stars,</i>
<i>Chris, do the best you can.</i>

353
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,834
<i>Like I always tell you</i>
<i>and your brother,</i>

354
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,066
keep the first thing
the first thing,

355
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,567
and I love you.

356
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,066
[cheers and applause]

357
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,567
You got me.
You got me.

358
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,233
Oh, my goodness.

359
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:37,467
Now, Bob, what would it mean
to you to win $100,000?

360
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:40,200
$100,000 isn‘t the thing
because money comes and goes,

361
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
but winning this title,
that means something.

362
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,133
You get to go forth
and carry a legacy

363
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,133
and do something and make
a change in somebody‘s life

364
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,934
and put first things first
and do something.

365
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:53,066
Right, well--right, well--

366
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,967
Now, I‘ve watched
all 109 episodes

367
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:56,834
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"

368
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,300
and I‘ve noticed
you have never once

369
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,100
walked into
the room purse first.

370
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,433
Oh, my God,
look at this.

371
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,066
Oh,
and it matches my outfit.

372
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,500
It‘s perfect.
I love it.

373
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,600
Purse first.
I love it.

374
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,834
[cheers and applause]

375
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,967
Give it up for Bob
The Drag Queen.

376
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:26,100
Up next we‘ve got
an Instagram superstar

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,433
who‘s about to
lisp sync for her life.

378
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,133
Now serving Kim Chi.

379
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,400

Wow.

420
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,066
Kim Chi,
I love that song.

421
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:32,266
It‘s got a good beat,
and you can‘t dance to it.

422
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:35,400
[laughter]

423
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,967
All right, Kim Chi,
let‘s hear from the judges.

424
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,066
Michelle Visage,
what‘s the tea on Kim Chi?

425
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:44,367
I love that your purity
and your beautiful energy

426
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:47,066
took something that was normally
considered negative

427
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,400
and turned it into something
fun and beautiful.

428
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,066
Yes.

429
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,934
Nailed it.

430
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,734
[laughter]

431
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,033
Today Kim Chi
is on the menu,

432
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,333
and you are the main course.

433
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,633
Who‘s hungry?

434
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,266
Now, Kim Chi, you came
to this competition hungry.

435
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,967
You won the first challenge,

436
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,367
and then you stayed hungry.

437
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,767
Let‘s take a look.

438
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,333
<i>My name is Kim Chi.</i>

439
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,767
<i>-[Kim] I came to chop suey</i>
<i>the competition.</i>

440
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,233
<i>I‘m known for crazy,</i>
<i>over-the-top</i>

441
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,934
<i>pure anime fantasy.</i>

442
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,133
Animazing.

443
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,367
<i>I may across shy</i>
<i>because I am soft-spoken,</i>

444
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:34,467
but donut come for me
because I‘ll destroy you.

445
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,967
I do get concerned
about your walk.

446
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,967
It‘s very stiff, darling.

447
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,233
Exqueeze me?

448
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,433
My mom doesn‘t know
that I do drag.

449
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,467
What?

450
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,400
Kim Chi,
you didn‘t just get better.

451
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,266
You got fierce.

452
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,200
<i>I don‘t want to be</i>
<i>America‘s next drag superstar.</i>

453
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,767
<i>I am America‘s</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>

454
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,367
Now, Kim Chi,
you were so honest

455
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,934
and vulnerable this season.

456
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,300
In fact,
watching the show back,

457
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,500
at one point
you made me ugly cry, girl,

458
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,066
so I hope you don‘t mind

459
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:13,567
if I ask you
some very personal questions.

460
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:18,500
First one, when was
the last time you fell down?

461
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
[laughter]

462
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Actually, earlier today.

463
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,200
I‘m not even joking.

464
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,433
I tripped on my skirt,

465
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,233
and I fell over
the craft service table.

466
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,700
[laughter]

467
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,533
Now, everyone
is gagging on your looks,

468
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:39,100
just so many amazing looks.

469
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,066
What inspires you?

470
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,133
My inspiration comes
from a lot of random places.

471
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,400
I could be walking
down the street

472
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,467
and see a rock and be like,
"Oh, that rock is pretty.

473
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,133
Let me make a gown
inspired by the rock,"

474
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,600
so there‘s no one
set inspiration,

475
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,066
but everyday life and nature.

476
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,367
Now, is it true
you gave the $3,000

477
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,834
you won in
the first challenge

478
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,066
to your mother?
Why‘d you do that?

479
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:03,066
My mom works really hard to,
you know, pay the bills,

480
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,233
and she works as a server
at a Korean restaurant

481
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,533
currently,
and I want to do everything

482
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:10,166
that I can to help
my mom financially.

483
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,767
Yeah.

484
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,834
Have you told her
that you do drag yet?

485
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:21,533
I still have not,
but, you know, it‘s like--

486
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,133
She didn‘t watch the show?

487
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,133
I mean,
she‘s very Korean-American,

488
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,233
and she‘s really, like, not open
to American culture at all,

489
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:31,066
so I don‘t think--
yeah, I don‘t think

490
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,100
she‘ll ever find out
about "Drag Race."

491
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,066
Well, listen,
I am a firm believer in

492
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:39,266
things happen when
they‘re supposed to happen,

493
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:41,100
so right after this,

494
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,400
why don‘t we drive
over to your mother‘s house

495
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,467
and I tell her myself?

496
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,066
-Road trip?
-Road trip.

497
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,967
- Road trip.
- Yes.

498
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,066
Who‘s here
supporting you tonight?

499
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,333
I have my friend
Ryan, Diana, Amy, and Trixie.

500
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,367
So Diana, what do you think
of Kim Chi‘s journey?

501
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:08,233
I think Kim Chi
is the most creative, talented,

502
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:10,166
and hardworking person I know.

503
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,533
I‘m so happy
to be your friend,

504
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,533
and I want the best for you.

505
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,166
All right, now,
we‘ve got some fan questions

506
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,166
for you, Kim Chi.

507
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,066
Oh, look,
we have the Pit Crew coming d--

508
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,533
and they--
you forgot your pants, guys.

509
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,500
Kim Chi,
Tiara from Facebook asks,

510
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,934
"If you could
lose your virginity

511
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:33,100
to a member of the Pit Crew,

512
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,100
who would it be?"

513
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,200
Um, I‘m not trying
to catch anything,

514
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,533
so I‘m gonna say none of them,
but--

515
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,100
[audience groans, laughs]

516
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,066
Shade. Shade.

517
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:04,400
Shade!
[laughs]

518
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,200
Oh, thank you,
Pit Crew members.

519
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,500
I don‘t know what
to say after that.

520
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,100
All right, Kim Chi,
well, we have one more question.

521
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,367
Well, actually,
it‘s more of a statement.

522
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,066
Take a look.

523
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:25,266
Kim Chi,
I am supreme leader,

524
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:30,333
but you are supreme
drag queen.

525
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,834
You better work,

526
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,166
or else I put you
in a labor camp.

527
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,100
Kim Chi, it‘s Margaret Cho.

528
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,066
I‘m so proud of you.
You‘re so beautiful.

529
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:45,100
You are so funny, and I think
you are a good dancer.

530
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:49,800
[cheers and applause]

531
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:53,133
So Kim Chi,
what would it mean to you

532
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,433
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?

533
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,333
It would obviously
change my life.

534
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,166
I‘d be able to not be broke.

535
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,667
I‘d be able to afford
guacamole on my burrito bowl.

536
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:07,300
I‘d be able to start
my own makeup company,

537
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,567
which I would love to do,

538
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,333
and it would mean that

539
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,066
anybody who‘s ever felt
like they weren‘t

540
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,233
part of anything,
anybody that felt like

541
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,233
they couldn‘t be anything,

542
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,066
as long as you stay true
to who you are,

543
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,567
be creative, be original,

544
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,100
and your dreams
will eventually come true.

545
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,300
Well, Kim Chi,
read my lisp,

546
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,567
we love you.

547
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,433
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Kim Chi.

548
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,066
[cheers and applause]

549
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,600
Now it‘s time for our

550
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,900
final performance
of the night.

551
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,533
Oh, and by the way,
kittens,

552
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,600
you can buy these
top three songs right now

553
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,500
wherever fine music is sold,

554
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,467
and you can watch them
again and again

555
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,500
at logotv.com.

556
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,667
Now, our next queen
strutted her stuff

557
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,166
all the way to the top.

558
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:59,600
Please give a big supermodel

Wow.

607
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,667
Legs for days.

608
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:57,066
Okay, Naomi, let‘s talk
to the judges. Michelle Visage?

609
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,700
Honey, whatever‘s on the menu,
I‘m buying two.

610
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,433
Look how far
you‘ve come, honey,

611
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,333
and you have proven tonight

612
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,433
that you have legs up
on the competition.

613
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,266
Yes, you do.

614
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:12,533
You came, you saw,
you contoured,

615
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,300
and you conquered.

616
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,567
Yes.

617
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:20,066
Thank you, Naomi Smalls.

618
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,567
Now, as the youngest queen
to compete this season,

619
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,433
you‘ve come a long way,
baby.

620
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,633
Let‘s take a look.

621
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,300
I am Naomi Smalls.

622
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,266
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.

623
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:34,100
<i>-[Naomi] Naomi has legs all</i>
<i>the way up to her asshole.</i>

624
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,533
<i>Naomi is a fashion girl.</i>

625
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,066
She‘s fucking fierce.

626
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:40,300
Bitches better beware.

627
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,967
Oh, all of that right there.

628
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,467
<i>I‘m giving you Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>strutting down</i>

629
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,367
<i>a Versace runway.</i>

630
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,066
I just thought
it was perfection.

631
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,533
This is how you win
this competition.

632
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,266
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.

633
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,200
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.

634
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,533
This is my mom.
She‘s, like, the best mom ever.

635
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,567
Do you have a message
you want to say to your mother?

636
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,567
Thank you for everything
you‘ve ever done,

637
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:05,800
and I hope I can repay you
for the rest of my life.

638
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,066
I‘m Naomi Smalls,

639
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,533
and I promise
to represent you fiercely.

640
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:15,500
[cheers and applause]

641
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,667
Naomi, you have the fever
and the flavor for fashion.

642
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,100
Now, where does that come from?

643
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,967
I honestly don‘t know
because I grew up in, like,

644
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,834
a family
that was--sorry, guys,

645
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,066
not the most fashion-forward
or anything like that,

646
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,367
but I just remember,
like, looking at magazines

647
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,500
when I was a kid and just
being so obsessed with them,

648
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,166
and I wanted to look
like these amazing supermodels

649
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,533
-that were in the glossy pages.
-Sure, yeah.

650
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,467
Now, halfway through
the competition

651
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,467
you seemed to come to life.

652
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:48,500
What happened?

653
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,133
I was so scared
in the beginning

654
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:53,100
of standing out and--like,
for the wrong reasons,

655
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,567
but when it comes
to Snatch Game,

656
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:57,333
you can‘t hide anywhere,

657
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,834
and being in the bottom two

658
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:00,900
and having to lip
sync for my life

659
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,233
just put that fire
underneath my ass

660
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,567
to take chances and stand out
for all the right reasons.

661
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,400
-Yeah, you did really well.
-Thank you.

662
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Now, Naomi,
we have a taped message

663
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,533
from one fierce queen.

664
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,567
Let‘s take a look.

665
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,600
Hi, Naomi.

666
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,266
Now, in Westeros

667
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,100
there‘s only room
for one queen,

668
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,934
but in Ru‘s queendom, girl,

669
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,200
I can‘t wait to see
you take that crown.

670
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,133
Now...Cersei that walk.

671
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,567
[cheers and applause]

672
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,000
-I love that.
-So good.

673
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Now, we have some
fan questions.

674
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,467
G-G-G-Gia?

675
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:52,200
-Herminio from Mexico...
-Hi, Herminio.

676
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,400
Would like to know
how did it feel

677
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,133
when Naomi Campbell
checked you online?

678
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:04,300
[laughs] It was, like,
the biggest moment of my life.

679
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
What did she say?

680
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,233
Well, she followed me
on Instagram,

681
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,166
and then she had,
like, this interview saying,

682
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,333
"I really am loving that
Naomi Smalls," and I, like--

683
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,633
I love that.

684
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,433
Tell me this.
What would it mean to you

685
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:19,900
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?

686
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,500
It would mean
the world to me

687
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,467
to be America‘s
next drag superstar.

688
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,100
Just to get that
stamp of approval

689
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,467
from you and carry on
your legacy would be--

690
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,133
<i>-[Crowd] Yeah, supermodel,</i>
<i>work!</i>

691
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:31,333
The biggest goal
I ever met in my life.

692
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,400
I love it.
Now, before we go,

693
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,233
I want to say hello
to your mother.

694
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,367
Where is she?

695
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,433
She‘s right there.

696
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,500
- Would you--where--

697
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, there she is.

698
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,600
Hi.

699
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,233
So June,

700
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:48,400
what was it like
raising a leggy supermodel?

701
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,934
Well, I‘m a little shocked

702
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:52,433
that he didn‘t get
fashion tips from me.

703
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,467
I had no idea.

704
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,433
He has always been amazing.

705
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:57,433
-Really?
-Yes.

706
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:00,233
Did you buy the fashion
magazines, or did--

707
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:04,367
No, but I did start buying
the wigs and the shoes

708
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:05,533
and the--

709
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:08,734
[cheers and applause]

710
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:17,066
Now, besides Naomi,
how many kids did you raise?

711
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,600
-12 altogether.
-Wow.

712
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,400
Wow.

713
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,467
Naomi, where are
your other brothers

714
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,233
and sisters tonight?

715
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,500
Well, they‘re
all over the world.

716
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,333
They‘re actually
all over this theater too.

717
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,433
Well, let‘s bring them out,
the Von Trapp family singers.

718
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,767
[laughter]
Come on out.

719
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,100
Where are they?

720
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:45,300
Oh! Oh! How are you?

721
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,066
- Hi, sweetie.
- How are you?

722
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,400
-How are you?
-Ahh!

723
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,133
You know,
like I always say,

724
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:59,066
the family that drags together
slays together.

725
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:01,500
Let‘s hear it
for the legendary,

726
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,100
all legs, no dairy,
Naomi Smalls.

727
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,967
Now, we‘re just moments
away from crowning

728
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:09,133
America‘s next drag superstar,

729
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:14,233
but first it‘s time
to bring back my girls.

730
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,100
[cheers and applause]

731
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,300
Starting with a nerdy bird,

732
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,266
a glam rock rebel,

733
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,400
and one cuckoo queen.

734
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,400
My name is
Dax ExclamationPoint.

735
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,900

All right, ladies,
let‘s turn up the juice

742
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,200

My name is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Do you want to see my cuckoo?

756
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,066
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.

757
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,867
I need a space
for this junk in the trunk.

[cheers and applause]

764
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,233
Dax ExclamationPoint
and Laila McQueen, welcome back.

765
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:36,066
-Hello.
-Hey, Ru.

766
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,900
So Dax, I hear that the song
"I Will Survive"

767
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,934
is haunting you
everywhere you go.

768
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,400
-Is that true?
-Yes,

769
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
like, literally everywhere I go,

770
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,400
like, it could be a gas station,
grocery store, anywhere,

771
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,166
it just happens to come on.

772
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,533
Listen, if I were you two,
I would seize the moment.

773
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,300
I would record another song.

774
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,300
I would s--call it
"I Didn‘t Survive."

775
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,834
You know?
It‘d be a huge hit.

776
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,300
But seriously, there are
no losers on "Drag Race."

777
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,533
Dax, what‘s life been like
since you were on the show?

778
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,834
Honestly, life
has been absolutely amazing.

779
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,367
Like, the fans
have been phenomenal.

780
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,100
I mean, obviously, like,
I don‘t have as many fans as,

781
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,066
like, you know, Kim Chi
or Bob or Naomi.

782
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,367
That‘s fine.
It‘s fine,

783
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:16,934
but the ones
I do have are phenomenal.

784
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:19,300
Now, I‘ve got a confession
to make.

785
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,066
Laila McQueen
and I have a secret past.

786
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,066
I deny it, but there‘s proof.

787
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,166
Take a look.

788
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,433
[groans]

789
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:32,300
That little pixie to the right
of me is Laila McQueen

790
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
when I was not
running for president

791
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,100
in Manchester, New Hampshire.

792
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,333
You know, my grandmother
calls you Ron Paul.

793
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,166
[laughter]

794
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,600
Now, did you ever
imagine at that point

795
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,333
that you would be on this stage?

796
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,200
Oh, absolutely not.

797
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,533
I mean, I was performing in,

798
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,600
like, function halls
and Mexican restaurants.

799
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,500
Like, I never imagined being
here or anywhere else

800
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,133
around the world.

801
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:58,166
So now, what‘s happened
to you because of "Drag Race"?

802
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:01,300
I get to go everywhere
and meet the people

803
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,066
that love the work I do
and embrace so much love

804
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:07,533
that I never thought
I would see.

805
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,367
All that at the truck stop?

806
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,333
[laughter]

807
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,233
So Dax, Laila,

808
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,166
you aren‘t just surviving.

809
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:20,300
-You are thriving.
-Thank you.

810
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:28,967
Next up,
straight from Santee Alley,

811
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,066
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

812
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,233
Now, since the show,
you‘ve been through it,

813
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,567
haven‘t you, girl?

814
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:41,066
Yes, actually the episode
that I been eliminated,

815
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,066
I was experience symptoms.

816
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,367
I‘m here to celebrate that.

817
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,934
-Wow.
-Yes.

818
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:51,433
And how do you feel right now?

819
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:54,433
I‘m in the discharge process
already right now,

820
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,834
so I feel amazing.

821
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:59,100
-I feel fantastic.
-Good. Yeah.

822
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:04,066
Did any of your drag sisters
reach out to you?

823
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,300
Yes, one special person,

824
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,867
and it‘s Acid Betty.

825
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,700
- That Acid Betty?
- That Acid Betty.

826
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,066
Yeah, Acid Betty.

827
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,533
She came to visit me as soon

828
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,567
as she knew
that I was diagnosed.

829
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,834
She was taking care of me.

830
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:22,800
She was like, "Bitch,
you‘re not alone.

831
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,433
I got your back."

832
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,166
I think the positive attitude

833
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,934
from all my entire
new sisterhood

834
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:34,066
helped me to recovery

835
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,200
and helped me
to be more positive every day.

836
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
Wow.

837
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,266
I love it.

838
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:44,066
Well, Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
we are cuckoo for your cuckoo.

839
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,066
Thank you.

840
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:48,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

841
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,567
Now a queen
who always picks up when I call

842
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:58,066
and a badass
in total control of herself.

843
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,400
Let‘s take a look.

844
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,066
The beauty is here.

845
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:04,433
My name is Naysha Lopez.
I spend money.

846
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,100
I don‘t do drag on a dime.

847
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Naysha Lopez, sashay away.

848
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,467
How soon can you get here?

849
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,300
Bitches, I‘m back!

850
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:19,533
Face, body, glamour.

851
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,066
Your ass is real?

852
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,100
Yes. Realness, boo.

853
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:28,500
This acid trip is all real.

854
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,367
My drag style is completely over
the top, punk unicorn realness.

855
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,166
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she‘s a bitch.

856
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,400
I‘m not gonna be unprepared
because of you, boo.

857
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,133
Acid Betty,

858
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:41,100
you‘ve taken us
on one wild trip.

859
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,066
Now, Naysha Lopez, Michelle
and I have a running bet, okay?

860
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:58,066
That ass of yours, is it real?

861
00:38:58,066 --> 00:38:59,467
So listen, Ru, I--

862
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,066
[laughter]

863
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,166
I eat well.
I work out.

864
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,767
I have 10 ccs
of medical grade silicon.

865
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:09,533
I--no.

866
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,433
[laughter]

867
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,500
So on the show
you said your ass was real.

868
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,934
My ass is real.

869
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:18,467
However, have I had
some enhancements

870
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,300
to the body-ody-ody?

871
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,533
-Yeah.
-Yes, I have.

872
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,133
Ah.

873
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:27,066
[laughing]

874
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,200
Now, you missed
the Madonna runway storyline.

875
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,567
- Yes.
- What would you have worn?

876
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,066
I‘m a very creative person,

877
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:37,900
and what I had going on
was another kimono.

878
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,133
What?
What is it with these queens

879
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,567
and kimonos?

880
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:47,300
Naysha, thanks for gracing us
with your gorgeous beauty

881
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,266
and that booty twice.

882
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:50,934
Yes.

883
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:52,600
Next, Acid Betty.

884
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,333
Now, are you really here,

885
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,367
or am I having a flashback?

886
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,500
Now, you turned out some killer
looks this season.

887
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,233
-[crowd whooping]
-Thank you.

888
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,533
How have fans been to you?

889
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,200
I love the fans.

890
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,400
They are the best, the best.

891
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,100
The best thing
of this show are the fans.

892
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,433
The love is so intense,
and it‘s wonderful.

893
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:18,266
I actually had a kid
that I met at DragCon,

894
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,967
and they decided that
they were gonna go into fashion

895
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,033
and got a full
scholarship to FIDM

896
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,200
because of seeing me
on the TV show.

897
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,967
-Wow. Wow.
-That‘s really great.

898
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,834
Now, Acid Betty,
you took a lot of heat

899
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:33,166
for your Nancy Grace
impersonation,

900
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:36,934
but some people really,
really liked it.

901
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,100
Take a look.

902
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,166
Acid Betty,
I loved watching you be me,

903
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,934
but frankly,
speaking professionally,

904
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,266
you got a raw deal.

905
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:48,133
You were robbed.

906
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,233
No tea, no shade,

907
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:52,367
but unleash the lawyers.

908
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,066
We got a case here.

909
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:58,266
-That‘s fierce.
-I love it.

910
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:00,633
Aci, I could go
on talking to you all night,

911
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:02,500
but I refuse
to say anything further

912
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,266
until I lawyer up.

913
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
Acid Betty.

914
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:10,934
Now, the best way to describe
our next three queens

915
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,166
is brassy, Brooklyn,

916
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,100
and Britney, bitch.

917
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,066
Good morning.
My name is Robbie Turner,

918
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:22,934
and I‘m the kindest queen
you‘ll ever meet.

919
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:25,333
♪ I want you to be hot
and saucy ♪

920
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,834
♪ ♪

921
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,066
-Yes, Marilyn.
-She‘s in a league of her own.

922
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:32,066
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.

923
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,934
-Oh!
-Oh!

924
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,233
Too real?

925
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,066
Whoo! Thorgy
with a T-H and orgy,

926
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,066
and I feel incredible.

927
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,967
I‘m colorful.
I‘m fun,

928
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,100
and I‘m a fashion clown.

929
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:51,433
This is harder on me
than it is for you guys.

930
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,567
No, it‘s not.

931
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:54,967
<i>-[Thorgy] I can be campy,</i>

932
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,333
<i>but also I can be,</i>
<i>like, fucking fierce.</i>

933
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,133
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.

934
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,300
Yes!

935
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:04,266
It‘d Derrick, bitch.

936
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:06,867
<i>-[Derrick] I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>

937
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:08,500
I also have a career
with my wigs on.

938
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
You‘ll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.

939
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,667
You have to give us more.

940
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,400
That is not a Britney reference.

941
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,400
-Oh!
-Oh!

942
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
That‘s how you go out
in style, girls.

943
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,133
Now, Robbie Turner,

944
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:31,333
how does someone so young know
so much about classic Hollywood?

945
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,567
My mother and father

946
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,367
wouldn‘t allow us to watch
contemporary films,

947
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,834
so we watched
classic Hollywood films

948
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:40,133
all the time, so I thought
they were contemporary.

949
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:43,266
So you can imagine
little baby Robbie

950
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,934
when she‘s like, "Judy Garland
died many moons ago,"

951
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:49,333
and it‘s like, "What?"

952
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,467
Now, what was your favorite
moment on the show?

953
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:57,066
On my birthday
I won the singing challenge

954
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:58,600
with the le chicken wings,

955
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,433
and Debbie Harry came back

956
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:03,433
and said happy birthday to me.

957
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:05,200
I‘m like, um,

958
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,867
I don‘t see the problem
with this birthday at all--

959
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:11,266
"Drag Race,"
Debbie, chicken wings.

960
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:14,066
[laughter]

961
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:17,834
Robbie, thank you so much
for all the classic sass.

962
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:20,600
Oh, and by the way,
I will be sending you a bill

963
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,166
for that broken light bulb
that you did.

964
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,100
Uh-huh.

965
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:28,900
Up next, hey, there,
Thorgy girl.

966
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,133
Hey, Ru.
Yeah!

967
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:35,333
[cheers and applause]

968
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,266
Now, like Michelle and I,

969
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:38,166
you and Bob

970
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,367
have a very complicated
relationship.

971
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:43,066
Tell me about it.

972
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,934
I love to argue
and fight about everything.

973
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,367
I love it.
There‘s always a way

974
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:48,500
to tear things apart
and make them better.

975
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,834
Bob can take it from me.

976
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:51,633
He‘ll just listen
to me talk and go,

977
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:53,066
"I still don‘t like you."

978
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,567
[laughter]

979
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,533
But when people see me
and Bob doing that,

980
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,066
they‘re like, "Oh, you guys
really don‘t like each other."

981
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:00,233
I‘m like, "I just love
fighting with him so much,"

982
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:02,133
but I‘m just in love
with Bob very much.

983
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:05,467
Now, you have dreams
of starting a thorchestra?

984
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:06,533
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

985
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,567
What is a--what‘s
a thorchestra?

986
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,967
Well,
ever since I was playing violin

987
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:12,200
and then I got into,
like, the art of drag,

988
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,367
I wanted to conduct, like,
a 40-piece orchestra.

989
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,667
I wanted to travel the world.

990
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,100
I want, like, Rufus Wainwright

991
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,133
to wheel out on a piano
and be like, "Oh,

992
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:21,400
my friend Rufus
is here to sing a song."

993
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,266
That‘s a great idea.

994
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:26,300
Will you play a little something
for us right now?

995
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,467
Sure.

I‘m not leaving that behind.

1014
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,567
Of course I wanted

do Britney now, I can do drag.

throughout the season

1020
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,600
you were not afraid
to speak your mind loudly,

1021
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,066
especially with Bob and Naomi.

1022
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:43,400
You have any regrets about that?

1023
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,767
Everything?

1024
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,066
Oh, gosh, it‘s hard
because I watch it back,

1025
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,266
I‘m like, "Oh, wow,
I shouldn‘t have said that.

1026
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,367

that drink and untucked,"

1028
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,266
I have a hard time
taking criticism

1029
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,333
because I‘ve never been
criticized like that before.

1030
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,233
Doing Britney was
what I‘ve always done,

1031
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:03,834
and I was praised for that,

1032
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:06,066
and now coming
into this competition

1033
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,567
it was almost looked down
upon that that was something

1034
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:09,834
that I was known to do.

1035
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,100
And I learned so much
from Naomi,

1036
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,066
and she taught me
how to block my brows,

1037
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:16,333
and I think I‘m doing it now.

1038

Thank you, Derrick,

1039
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:22,500

what has your year been like?

My year has been incredible.

1223
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,533
I‘ve worked with some of
the best people in the industry,

1224
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:30,066
the fashion world,
the burlesque world,

1225
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,233
the art world.
I‘ve gotten validation,

1226
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:35,100
people that I respected for
years and years and years,

1227
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:40,066
so it‘s been the most personally
gratifying year of my life.

1228
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:43,066
I am so thankful to RuPaul,
all the fans.

        - Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
        Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
        Good luck.
        Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
    How the hell can you love
somebody else?
   Can I get an amen in here?
        And don't fuck it up.
        - Oh, my God.
            Hey.
        I am Peppermint,
    and I am sweet and sassy.
       Yes. I perform
    and host in New York.
                When you come
        to a Peppermint show,
   you're gonna see people
screaming and hollering,
     money flying and you're
     gonna feel special.
        I look great.
        Perfect.
            My braids
     are sitting just right.
    I got it going on.
               All right,
       let's get to work.
            - Hello.
       It's me, Valentina.
    (speaking Spanish)
      Who am I? Valentina.
        I'm 25 years old.
    I'm from Echo Park,
    California.
            Sass.
        Hey, beauty.
        - Valentina.
    I'm Peppermint.
    - (speaking Spanish)
             Mwah.
             - Mwah.
    My type of drag,
    it's very dramatic,
                very theatrical
        and always very Latina.
    I'm an undiscovered
        superstar.
    I've always dreamed
    of being in here,
    and here we are, girlfriend.
      - Here we are, girl.
    - Oh, come on, give it up
    for the big girl
    serving pure catfish.
    My name is Eureka,
    and I am 25 years old.
   People would categorize me
       as a pageant queen,
       but to me, my drag
    is the genre of fabulous.
                        (laughs)
         Hi, I'm Eureka.
    - Where are you from?
    - East Tennessee.
    Girl, I'm country
    as a biscuit, honey,
   and I love eating 'em, too.
                Your hair's hot.
    - Thank you, girl.
    - I love the baby hairs.
- I'm a little natural around
the way, girl, you know.
   - That's my favorite shape
            is round.
        - I can see.
         - I'll eat you.
        (all laugh)
        - Hi, hi, hi.
     It's about to get shady
           up in here.
    My name is Charlie Hides
    and I'm (muffled) years old.
        (door creaks)
            - Hey!
            - Hey!
    - Oh, my God,
    Peppermint's here.
   - I'm known as a celebrity
impersonator.
         My drag persona
         is rude, crude,
    socially unacceptable
    and over the top.
        Can I ask you,
        with that dress,
    why didn't you wear like
     a big pair of earrings?
- I really wanted to give you,
like, Walmart realness.
   - I'm getting that, Eureka.
   - Thank you.
        (all laugh)
   - It's Christina Aguilera.
        - So this is what
        it looks like.
        - She's naked.
    - My name is Farrah Moan,
    and I'm from
    Las Vegas, Nevada.
      - Oh, my God, dirty.
    - My drag is inspired
    by Vegas showgirls.
               My wardrobe
       shows a lot of skin
    and there's usually
    a feather or two
     or five dead ostriches.
     You never know with me.
    Hi.
    - Hi, I'm Charlie.
    - Charlie.
    - What's your name?
    - Farrah. Farrah Moan.
         - Farrah Moan walks in.
          She's a twig,
     and she looks about 12.
        I have underwear
         older than her.
        - Hi. I'm Eureka,
    like the vacuum cleaner.
        How are you?
    - I've never vacuumed
           before.
       - Well, I came
    to clean house, girl.
            - Aah!
             - What?
            - Aah!
                        (coughs)
        - Oh, wow.
   - My name is Sasha Velour.
    I am years 29 old.
    I am a bald, fashiony,
     artistic weird queen.
        Hi, ladies.
    I'm committed to being
    uniquely Sasha all the time.
    - Tell us about yourself.
    - I'm a visual artist.
     I love telling stories
     with art and with drag.
    - What story are you telling
with this unibrow?
        - (laughs)
     - How do you like them
     egg rolls, Mr. Charles?
      I'm Alexis Michelle,
    and I am New York City's
     premier Broadway queen.
        Oh, shit.
    I went to school
    for musical theater.
             I think
    the ultimate fantasy now
   would be to be on Broadway
            in drag.
    - Girl.
    - Come on, New York.
       - So the east coast
      is well represented.
       - I will say L.A.,
           west coast,
         it's the center
        of the universe.
                Sorry, New York.
        - She says forget
   what you heard, apparently.
        Memo taken.
    - My name is Shea Coulee,
   and I didn't come to play.
         I came to slay.
    - I love The Muppets.
    - I'm Shea Coulee,
    and I'm 27 years old.
       Shea Coulee is
    a champagne lifestyle
    on a lemonade budget.
            Hey!
    You're gonna get
    a full-on production
    when you see Shea Coulee.
        Costumes, check.
        Makeup, check.
    Dance moves, she got 'em.
    - Where are you from?
    - I'm from Chicago.
         - Yes, Chicago.
        (all laugh)
      - Chicago drag is the
   motherfucking bomb-dot-com.
        - Dot-com?
        - Yes, bitch.
        It's got its own domain.
        (all laugh)
    - The body is here, bitches.
        - Oh, shit.
   - Girl, I'm Trinity Taylor.
    Some people say I'm the look
          and feel of real,
        but my body
    speaks for itself.
         - Shut it down!
     - Trinity does not pad.
     I love plastic surgery,
    and I went from a pancake
        to a Kardashian.
     I do a lot of pageants,
     but I don't like to use
     the word pageant queen
      because there's such
a stigmatism with pageant queen.
    I can do anything,
         from beautiful
     to way outside the box.
       - Oh, my God. Lady!
    - Bitch, I'm just excited
        I know somebody.
       Me and Trinity know
   each other from competing.
   She, like, won the pageant
   that I really wanted to win
so, of course, there's that,
like, bougee attitude from her.
    - I am the body girl.
            I'm here
       and I'm not padded.
        - She's gonna be
        competition.
         - Who are
    the pageant girls?
    You're a pageant girl,
    I'm a pageant girl,
    you're a pageant girl.
    Just to clear the air,
    I promise I'm not
    one of the mean ones.
        (all laugh)
                - That is a lie.
             - Oh.
            - Ooh.
- There's always been tension
with me and Eureka.
    Maybe she has an issue
         with the fact
    that every pageant
    that we've been in,
        I beat her.
           - Is it me
      or is it hot in here?
         I'm Kimora Blac
         from Las Vegas.
    The queen is here.
    Bow down, bitches.
    - Oh, you ain't
    the only body, girl.
            - I love
      anything see-through
       and anything
    that shows my body.
    Big tits, big ass,
    irresistible.
    Gay guys love me,
    straight guys love me.
    Kimora Blac is everyone's
    sexual preference.
        - Hey, girl.
        - Oh, my God!
            Oh!
                Oh, my goodness.
    - That's my Vegas sister.
     Kimora's ass is famous.
    That's what she's
    gonna be known for.
    That ass is gonna have
    its own t-shirts.
    I can see it all now.
        - Season 9, baby.
         - How long
    you been doing drag?
         - Oh, my God,
        10 long years.
        - Bravo.
        - 10 long years.
        - 10 months.
    - And you can go to hell.
    - My debut was 10 months ago
when I performed.
    - I can't. I can't.
    I can't with her.
    - I'm fairly new to drag,
         but I wouldn't
         consider myself
         looking like
    an amateur drag queen.
    I carry myself like a winner
          and a superstar.
    - Come on, drag queen.
    - (laughs)
    - Hi, shape-shifters.
        - I am Jaymes Mansfield,
    I am 26 years old,
        and I'm from
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
                I build puppets.
    I'm a kooky, comedy queen
      that has way more
up her sleeve than they know.
        All right.
   - Jaymes Mansfield looks...
    scared and confused
    when she walks in.
               Like, am I
       in the right room?
    - Hi, honey.
    - Oh, my goodness.
        - These are my
        summer diamonds.
        Some are diamonds
        and some are not.
        (all laugh)
    - Is this all fake
    or is it real?
    - Um, I'd say the foot
    upward, it's all fake.
   - I meant your personality.
            - Ooh.
            - Ooh.
    - I'm Nina Bo'nina,
    banana fo-fana,
     Osama bin Laden, Brown,
     boom, boom, boom, boom.
        I am Nina Bo'nina Brown,
    and I am back in town
    to shut her down.
    Well, no, I can't say
    I'm back in town,
    'cause I haven't even
    been in town yet.
        - Yes, ma'am.
   - She seems a little mousy.
         - Hey, sisters.
            - Yay!
            - Yes.
          - My drag
    consists of fantasy.
               One minute
       I may be a zombie.
         The next time
         I may be a nun.
                I'm not cosplay.
    Nobody does what I do.
   - What inspired your look?
    - Well, you know, my drag
    is like universal, honey.
                You never know
        what you're gonna get.
   - So your drag's like STDs.
                You never know
        what you're gonna get.
        - Exactly.
            - Oh!
            - Oh!
        - My name is Aja and I'm
        from Brooklyn, New York.
           Your edges
    are officially snatched.
             - Yeah.
         - Aja is vangy.
    Her drag style is very
    the streets of Tokyo
        meets the streets
        of Brooklyn.
         She's cute,
    but she's dangerous.
     - Oh, my. I am so happy
           to see you.
         - I'm so happy.
         - I love Aja.
   She is the number one name
           in Brooklyn
             that people
    are talking about right now.
    - Hi. Aja. Mwah, mwah.
     Oh, you are so gorgeous
            in blue.
     - Thank you, thank you.
     So nice to meet you.
   Aja's makeup is just really
rough around the edges,
        but she comes off
        as confident.
        Does she know
    what she looks like?
    'Cause if not,
    I need to tell her.
    - I feel like I'm at home
    with so much talented girls.
            - Yes!
             - Oh!
            - Oh!
                        - Bitch!
      - Yes, ma'am, honey.
     - That's a damn good
     Lady Gaga impersonator.
        - Oh, girl.
        - Oh, my God.
      So this is the Derek Barry
            of the season.
            - Oh!
                - Yo, I'm Ronnie
        and I'm from New Jersey.
   I'm New Jersey's number one
   Lady Gaga impersonator.
    But what I'm really
    excited about
      is how long it takes
for these queens to figure out
that it's really me.
        - Is it time to go home?
        - (laughs)
                - Wait a minute.
          - The winner
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
          of Anastasia
     Beverly Hills cosmetics
        and a cash prize
        of $100,000.
        - ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪
        - ♪ May the best woman ♪
    ♪ Best woman win ♪
        - Mother Monster
        has arrived.
                - Wait a second.
        (screaming)
    - Holy fucking balls,
    it's Lady Gaga.
       Like, the real one.
        - Holy shit.
   I'm on "RuPaul's Drag Race"
Season 9,
            and Lady Gaga
    is in the same room with me.
            Aah!
        (screaming)
        - Oh, my God.
        Oh, my God.
       - I can't tell you,
I have been the closest to death
         and you've
    pulled me out of it,
   and you don't even realize
   what you do for people
and how much you inspire people
like me and all of us.
    And I just want to tell you,
you're so amazing,
and I never thought in the world
I would ever meet you.
         And I think
    you're so incredible.
        I'm so sorry.
           I think
    you're so incredible.
            - Aw.
        (applause)
    - You allow us to be
    who we are as an artist.
        Thank you.
         - I have always
         really admired
   the craftsmanship that
   goes into what you all do.
    Drag has for me
    been an opportunity
           to leave myself
    when I didn't want to be me.
            - Right.
             - Yeah.
 - And felt so completely out of
place when I was in high school.
     Drag has just been part
of my life for the longest time.
    It's just really an honor
    for me to be here,
       to be with you all.
   - No, it's an honor for us.
   - Yes, Gaga.
    (cheers and applause)
        (door opens)
    - Hello, hello, hello!
    (cheers and applause)
        Oh, my Gaga!
        (all laugh)
    Gather round, ladies.
        Oh, darling, mwah, mwah.
        You look amazing.
     - Thank you, so do you.
       - Now you've had a chance
               to meet my girls.
     Do you have any advice
            for them?
                - You know, when
        you're having a bad day,
    just remember
    that I was nobody,
   and then I became somebody
            one day.
        And it's the same
        right here.
             - Ah!
            - Yes.
    - Your lives are gonna
     change forever today.
    And I would also
    remember something
    that you taught me
    a very long time ago.
    - Get the money up front?
     - Yes, and on the back.
        - (laughs)
    - Remember what
    he always has said:
       ♪ You better work ♪
       - Turn to the left.
       - Turn to the left.
             - Work.
             - Work.
        - Now turn to the right.
        - Now turn to the right.
             - Work
             - Work.
        - Sashay, shante.
    (cheers and applause)
    - Now, as you can see,
   this season is going to be
stuffed with more stars,
more stunts and more shenanigans
than ever before.
             - Yeah!
     - And on this premiere,
              for the first time
      in "Drag Race" herstory...
                        - Uh-oh.
        - No one...
        is going home.
            - Oh!
            - Oh!
    - (gasps) Crack, crack,
    crack, crack, crack, pow!
    Face on the floor.
        - #OhMyGaga.
    And ladies, to get
    this episode started,
    we're throwing a pageant.
            - Oh.
            - Oh.
    - Yes, Miss Thing,
the Miss Charisma, Uniqueness,
Nerve & Talent Pageant.
        (all laugh)
        - Yes!
        Oh, my God!
        I can do this.
    I want to show these bitches
                that I'm the one
                to look out for.
    - You'll be competing
    in two categories.
   First, you need to show us
        where you're from
          with a frock
   inspired by your home city.
    Second, as a salute to
    our legendary guest star,
    you need to strut your stuff
        in your favorite
         Lady Gaga drag.
    So don't be a drag,
    just be a queen.
    (cheers and applause)
          - Lady Gaga,
    would you do the honors?
       - Gentlemen,
    start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
             - Whoo!
             - Yes!
        - Move, bitch.
        - Oh, my God, up.
        - Watch out now.
        - Ow!
     - I'm right behind you,
     honey. Sorry, guys.
    - Where am I gonna go?
    Where am I gonna go?
    - This first challenge
    is very important
    because this is the first
impression that you make.
No one can afford to fuck
      this shit up.
                - Bam, bam, bam.
    - Are they sure this
    wasn't the challenge,
    'cause I feel like
        I'm winded.
     - Is this already
     a claimed work station?
            Hello?
     Am I missing something?
       Can someone tell me
if there's another station
somewhere that I'm not seeing?
             (sighs)
           - Farrah
    is awkwardly endearing
        with the way
        that she whines.
           - So am I,
   like, Matilda or something?
       - I call her
    Blonde Benet Glamsy
    'cause she whines like
    a 6-year-old, so, huh.
    - I really want
    a station of my own.
     - So have you ever done
     a Gaga look before?
- Yeah, 'cause I've played her
 a bunch of times in my video.
   - Oh, yeah, in your videos.
   - I make YouTube videos,
    which I make by myself
    in my living room.
         I've been making fun of
 Lady Gaga on YouTube for years.
    I am always afraid that
    when I impersonate people
    that they're gonna watch
           my videos.
     Lana del Rey said I was
     an asshole, apparently.
                - Lana del Rey
        called you an asshole?
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Charlie has a very on the edge
kind of sense of humor.
     It's an acquired taste,
and I'm not sure if the judges
have acquired that taste.
- I'm wearing the rainbow kimono
that Gaga wore.
        - Yes, bitch.
        - Coming through.
    - It's V collar.
    Oh, like it's the one.
        I was like, can I, like,
        go through your archives
    and, like, have stuff?
     And he was like, yeah,
     take whatever you want.
     - Aja is very New York.
    "I'm from New York.
       I did this."
          "Oh, my God,
     this guy made me this."
   She talks about the costume
designers and all this jazz.
        No one cares.
   - Touch it. It's arctic fox
       dyed with saffron.
    - Oh. My hometown look
    is a Georgia peach.
Girl, I said, how am I gonna go
from a damn mouse to a peach?
        I haven't seen
        a lot of girls
    who can get some paper
     and some kind of glue
    and create a new face.
         I may not have
         the best stuff,
   but I work with what I got,
    and I think that's
    what makes me different.
    I just need for people
    to believe in me.
- Ladies, who wants to win
the first challenge the most?
            - Me!
            - Me!
        - Come on, girl!
        - Everybody.
      - Get in line, girl!
    - I'm about to storm
    all you bitches.
    - Right. She gonna be
    just like the candy.
    She gonna dissolve.
          Ha ha!
    - The stakes are high
    for this first challenge
    because everyone is fighting
         for that spotlight.
      - The true Gaga-rini,
that is what's about to go down.
     - I feel very prepared
           and ready.
   The only thing that I want
   from this challenge
       is to beat Trinity.
    - Coming up....
    - She (bleep) nailed it.
    - You could put Donald Trump
           in that dress,
    he's gonna look gorgeous.
   - That I don't agree with.
           (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (applause)
                        - Hello.
               Welcome to
       the Miss Charisma,
        Uniqueness, Nerve
        & Talent Pageant.
    Let's meet our distinguished
panel of judges.
    Fourth runner-up in the Miss
South Plainfield New Jersey
   Popping, Dipping, Spinning
   and Vogue-ing Pageant,
        Michelle Visage is here.
    - Darling, I wear it
    with pride. Thank you.
    - Style superstar,
    Carson Kressley.
     - I love that this is
    a scholarship pageant.
        Great work.
    - And the hilarious
    Ross Mathews.
        - I have Vaseline
        on my teeth.
                        - Ha ha!
    - And the one,
    the only Lady Gaga.
    - Well, if you could
        do me a favor
   and shoot me from the left
        and put a filter
   on that camera, would you?
   - All right, Ms. Streisand.
         Now, to get
    to know them better,
         our contestants
    will introduce themselves
wearing frocks that represent
their home cities.
    Let the pageant begin.
        (applause)
        Category is...
    First up, Peppermint.
        - Check out
        those big apples.
     - My name is Peppermint
     from New York City,
      home of Metro cards,
   EBT cards and Lady Liberty.
        - That's a mint
    I'd like to bite into.
        - Valentina.
                - Ole, you stay.
                - I'm Valentina.
       I'm from East L.A.
         and I'm repping
         Mariachi Plaza.
                - Oh, Mary-achi.
                Next up, Eureka.
    She's the forgotten
    Mandrell sister.
                        - Right.
         - Howdy, y'all.
           I'm Eureka
    and this is Mary Jo Beth.
        I come to you
    from East Tennessee,
    and I'm representing
    the redneck woman.
        (all laugh)
   - Honky-tonk ba-donka-donk.
        Charlie Hides.
Honey, she is Thanks-giving it
       to you, darling.
            - She is.
    - Hi. I'm Charlie
    from Massachusetts,
    the home of the pilgrims,
America's first drag queens.
                - She's a witch.
    - Burn her!
    - Burn her at the stake!
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.
   - I can tell from here
   she gives great head-dress.
    - Hi, my name's Farrah Moan.
   I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.
    Are you feeling lucky?
        - What happens in Vegas
                slays in Vegas.
         - That's right.
         - Yeah.
        - Next up, Sasha Velour.
         She's crowning.
        (all laugh)
   - Hi, I'm Sasha Velour
   and I'm from New York City,
    home of queer modern art,
Haring, Warhol, Basquiat.
    - Burger Queen.
    She's got a Whopper.
    We just can't see it.
    - Alexis Michelle.
    - These have always
    brought me luck.
    - I'm Alexis Michelle,
    a native New Yorker,
        home of Broadway, bagels
                and an epicenter
                of civil rights.
   - Work that message, girl.
     - Darn kids have tagged
     my swimsuit again.
   - See, it's the elder care
        that I relate to.
        - Shea Coulee.
      - She-brew national.
- Don't be fooled by the brats
that she got.
- My name's Shea Coulee
and, bitch, I'm from Chicago!
        (all laugh)
   Nothing reminds me of home
     more than a big wiener
 sandwiched in between two buns.
        - The other girls
       better "catch up."
    They "must-heard" about her.
           I want you
    to "relish" this moment.
        (all laugh)
        Somebody stop me.
        - (laughs)
         Trinity Taylor.
    - You must be this tall, Ru,
         to take that ride.
    - I'm Trinity Taylor
    from Orlando, Florida,
    the theme park capital
         of the world.
      Want to take a ride?
    - I'd take a ride
    on her disco trick.
        - Uh-huh.
        Kimora Blac.
   - Blac lives matter, y'all.
- Hello, my name is Kimora Blac
from the city of Las Vegas.
    All the girls in Vegas
         just know me
    as the youngest, hottest,
skinniest queen.
    And if you're feeling
    a little frisky,
    whatever you do to me
    stays in Vegas.
- This message has been brought
to you by penicillin.
        (all laugh)
   Up next, Jaymes Mansfield.
        - Holy cow!
   - Hi, I'm Jaymes Mansfield.
    I'm a<i> tejano</i> living
    in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
      land of beer, cheese
       and serial killers.
            Shh.
        (all chuckle)
    - She's a dairy queen.
            - Aja.
    - Make America gay again.
    - Yes.
    - My name is Aja
    and I'm from New York,
where people are always angry
       on the streets.
    But it's okay 'cause
    you could be yourself.
        Lady Liberty has spoken.
- I wonder how many immigrants
have gone through her.
        (all laugh)
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        She's got Georgia
        on her mind.
         - And her face.
- I am Nina Bo'nina banana
fo-nana Osama bin Laden Brown.
         Originally from
         South Kakalaki,
      you can now catch me
      in Atlanta, Georgia.
   Take a bite of this peach.
    - It looks like she's got
    a touch of the Zika.
    - (laughs)
    - Oh, my, Michelle.
The last thing I thought would
be brought up today is Zika.
        - Coming up...
    Our contestants
    return to the stage
        wearing their very best
                Lady Gaga drag.
    - Do I have something
         on my face?
        (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome back
    to the Miss Charisma,
        Uniqueness, Nerve
        & Talent Pageant.
        (applause)
    In this next category,
    our contestants
    return to the stage
        wearing their very best
                Lady Gaga drag.
    First up, Peppermint.
       Grammy Awards 2016.
    - If it ain't brocade,
         don't fix it.
         - Crowd control
         to Major Tom,
      giving you Gaga/Bowie
            realness.
             Because
    the entire point of drag
    is to give the middle finger
         to rules of gender.
        - I have nothing to say.
   I'm going to be speechless
        this whole time.
        - Wham, bam,
        thank you, ma'am.
    Next up, Valentina,
    the CFDA Awards.
    - That was Mugler when
    Nicola Formicetti was there.
- I am wearing the look
she wore for the CFDA Awards.
     I definitely see myself
     a bit in Lady Gaga
   because she carries herself
   with grace and glamour,
    but I always want to add
    a Latina flair to what I do.
    - I brought my sister
         as my date,
        and we were both
        on the red carpet
   like a bunch of pissed off
          New Yorkers.
   - Some things never change,
darling.
    - Paparazzi love her.
    Next up, Eureka,
    the "Telephone" video.
            - Yes.
      - Guilty as charged.
    I decided to do
    the "Telephone" look.
    I just want to give them
something big and glamorous
   and kind of risky couture.
   Got my titties on my chin,
    cinch, pull and tuck, honey,
that's the D.
        - Great choice, darling.
       I believe that was
      Jean de Castelbajac.
    who made that garment.
    - Oh, you say that
    to all the queens.
       - Next up, Charlie Hides,
               Brit Awards 2010.
   - That's a lace front wig,
           I believe.
    - I believe it is.
    - Yes.
      - I've chosen to wear
           the outfit
    that Lady Gaga wore
    for the 2010 Brit Awards.
    I've done Lady Gaga hundreds
        of times on YouTube,
and I think I'm pretty polished,
so I'm fairly confident.
        - Philip Treacy
    made this for McQueen,
and he gave it to me because
I was doing a tribute to him.
    - Don't be a drag,
    be a McQueen.
     Next up, Farrah Moan,
    the "Alejandro" video.
                - Pray and slay.
    - Oh, my God,
    look at her cross.
      - I look exactly like
            Lady Gaga
        in my "Alejandro"
        music video look,
    and I'm rocking my real hair
     and I really hope that
     Lady Gaga lives for it.
    - That attitude and the face
           is really good,
   and the makeup is on point
   because Steven Klein and I
    had an argument about it.
I thought it was too much makeup
in this scene.
    - Don't cross this queen.
      - Everybody needs a virgin
             to sacrifice.
      - Can I get an amen?
    Next up, Sasha Velour,
     the "Applause" video.
    - Do I have something
         on my face?
        (all laugh)
        - I'm wearing
        my favorite look
     that she has ever done.
   A Pierrot clown, high art,
   Pat McGrath makeup.
                It is the place
        where art and pop meet.
 - It's gonna be hard for this
not to be one of my favorites.
     - What do you live for,
              Gaga?
         - The applause.
        (all laugh)
     - Painted for the Gaga.
        (all laugh)
    - Alexis Michelle,
    the Golden Globes.
    Best actress realness.
      - When I saw Gaga at
 the Golden Globes in this gown,
     I said she's wearing
     Alexis Michelle's body.
    So here I am body, curve,
    swerve and trophies.
            - Yay!
    - Donatella Versace
    made this for me.
       That is not easy to
   make that bodice that way.
     Wonderful job, darling,
      and thank you for bringing
              my Globe with you.
        - It's Ver-sayce.
    - Matching trophy.
    - Shea Coulee,
    Monster Ball Tour.
        Paws up, baby.
    - My Lady Gaga look,
    it's ethereal, powerful,
    yet gentle and serene,
    and it mixes engineering
          and fashion.
- This reminds me of the film
that Nick Knight did
    with the yellow electric
          urine blonde.
            - Mmm.
- Urine blonde is my screen name
on Scruff.
            - It is?
            - Yes.
    - It's my password
        on Netflix.
        - Trinity Taylor,
 "American Horror Story, Hotel."
        - Yes, Countess.
        - Yes.
        - This look speaks to me
    because I love darkness
    and glamour and vampires.
            And Lady Gaga
      was so seductive and sexy
   and brilliant in the show.
- Trinity, a little club soda
will take that right out.
    - You know, they say that
    if you use your own spit,
           the enzymes
   break down the blood, so...
         - Good to know.
         - Thank you.
    - This competition
    is cutthroat.
         Kimora Blac,
    Lady Gaga "On The Go."
    - This is the Versace phase.
- I'm giving a look that Gaga
wears to, like, the airport.
   I think picking out what
   she's done for red carpets
        is so predictable
    and it's so, like,
    all right, done.
- Those boots, they remind me
       of the pleasers
    that I used to get
    off of, um...
    - Hollywood Boulevard,
            honey.
        - Yep, yep.
       - No ifs, ands
       or butts about it.
        - Uh-uh.
        - No, ma'am.
    - Jaymes Mansfield,
    the cover of "Vogue."
            - Oh.
     - I am serving you Gaga
    on the cover of "Vogue."
        My drag is campy
        and different,
     so I'm giving you Lady Gaga
          in slumber land.
         I look amazing.
    If they don't like
    this dress,
    don't blame me,
    blame Marc Jacobs.
    - Oh, she's a little sleepy.
       - It's Marc Jacobs.
       She's Marco-leptic.
   - She's actually not wrong,
either,
        because I was so tired
the day that we did that shoot
that that's probably what
I looked like in between shots.
      - Cover girl, put some gel
             in your hair.
    Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        VMAs 2009.
        - Oh, my God.
      - Yes, McQueen, yes.
- This was one of the biggest
nights of my life.
        - I'm serving you
 the black version of Lady Gaga.
    Lot of hips, a lot of ass
       and a lot of sass.
    I can't see how Lady Gaga
           is reacting
    because I can't see anybody.
    - I just love the expression
             in her face
   when she wears this outfit.
    You know, you can tell
         she's happy.
   - Oh, no, she's on the edge
           of whore-y.
       Up next, Aja,
    Commes des Garcons.
    - Now, where did I
    park my car?
        - For my Lady Gaga look,
   I'm wearing a remake of her
Commes des Garcons look
    that she wore to show
    that beauty has no shape.
- Now, I wore this because
the media was saying I was fat
   and I knew this archive,
so I called Commes des Garcons
    and I asked him
    if we could wear it.
          It's such
    an excellent choice.
      - And very slimming.
   - It's all about the waist.
        <i> - Oy, gevalt.</i>
        (all laugh)
        - Coming up...
        Wait a minute.
     Stop the music, please.
     The real competition
     is just about to begin.
        - Fuck. Oh!
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Okay, judges,
we are looking for one winner
    who has what it takes.
    Let's start with Peppermint.
    - I think Peppermint
    has a fun personality.
You could tell that she likes
to take the piss with her drag,
       and I do like that.
   I thought her Lady Liberty
   was kind of basic to me.
    Peppermint's David Bowie,
   it would have been so great
   to have the lightning bolt.
    - On the face, yeah.
    - Yeah.
       - I love when I see
      the exact impression
     and the detail in that,
       but the adding
    of the hoop earrings,
     I didn't understand it.
       Bowie wouldn't have
       worn them that big.
           If he did,
      he would've worn one.
         - One, exactly.
           - You know,
    so I'm looking at detail.
        - Valentina.
    - That hometown look of hers
    was my very favorite look
    of anybody up there.
               It was just
       such a strong look,
       and her Spanish sombrero,
               East L.A. homage,
   I thought it was super fun.
     I thought she was beautiful
          and I thought
    the makeup was on point.
    And then, the Lady Gaga look
       was also super strong.
    - Both of these looks
    brought a tear to my eye.
     Her walk was fantastic.
             For me,
     she was the best model.
            - Mm-hmm.
            - Wow.
    - Eureka, that first outfit,
    there was a little bit of
    a used-up Tina Turner there.
       - Tina Turner away.
- I was laughing and entertained
and that's part of this.
        As far as her Gaga look,
    I thought it was fun,
    it was detailed.
   - She's actually one of
   my favorites of the night.
                - Charlie Hides.
        Her first look
        was the pilgrim.
    - I wasn't blown away
    by the first look.
      I felt like there was
supposed to be a rip-away moment
     and it kind of just
sort of got a little mangled.
    But the Gaga look might have
been one of my favorites.
    - The detail of the way that
that lace sort of interlays,
    it's beautifully done.
        - Farrah Moan.
   - That first outfit was
definitely not Las Vegas.
     I felt it was more like
     a different version
   of, like, "Anna Karenina,"
            you know.
        - "Anna Karenina"
   goes to "Game of Thrones."
        - Well, she does
        sort of look like
   she's in the main showroom
         of the Vatican.
        - Yes.
        - (laughs)
   - As far as her Gaga look,
   being a smaller queen,
    she chose something
    that swallowed her up,
and that might not have been
the best idea for a Gaga look.
    - I was hoping that there
   was going to be tear-away.
    - Yes.
    - And there wasn't.
      I do have to say
I was impressed by her poise.
       - I'm wearing Poise
      right now, actually.
        Sasha Velour.
     - One too many props
     can spoil a good party.
    She was kind of cumbersomely
standing up there
    holding these things.
   - Hey, Michelle, it's only
episode one of season nine,
    and I'm already
    disagreeing with you.
             - Okay.
             - Okay?
    - Go on.
    - I like more is more.
     I like that she brought
           the props.
    She didn't waste any time
showing us who she is.
        - Too much.
    - If you just lose
    the portrait,
    this would've been
    a perfect performance.
- Look at Gaga finding middle
ground for Michelle and I.
     - And then, "Applause,"
     I thought she did well
           and even in
    that kind of flowy thing,
     it changed her persona.
     - Yes.
    - Yeah, I didn't know
         who it was.
    - Right.
    - And that is great drag.
             - Yeah.
         - I don't think
         any other queen
   told us exactly who she is
   better than she did.
    - Alexis Michelle.
- When you're gonna use things
like words on your body,
    you have to be able
    to read them.
            - Mm-hmm.
   - And the way they were
positioned on the bustier
     and on the corset,
     you couldn't read them.
       The point was lost.
    But her Gaga moment
    was stunning.
    - Yeah.
    - That dress is amazing.
      You could put Donald Trump
            in that dress,
    he's gonna look gorgeous.
    - No.
    - That I don't agree.
    The shape and the silhouette
that she achieved,
    this was really good.
    - Mm-hmm.
   - This is someone to watch,
            I think.
        - Shea Coulee.
    What'd you think about
    that first outfit?
- I thought that was really fun
and very memorable.
    I mean, who doesn't like
    a giant wiener on your head?
   - As long at it's girth-y.
         - And I thought
    the Gaga look was great.
        - That dress
        is just amazing.
- The dress was actually made
       by Jim Henson.
    - Of "The Muppets?"
    - Yes. The original dress
was made in very particularly
pleated origami,
    and it was mechanical.
                And I felt that
        some of the other girls
    went a little further
    with the detail.
    - Let's talk Trinity Taylor,
    no relation to Rip Taylor.
        - Oh, damn it!
        - Yeah.
    - I thought Trinity's
    Orlando outfit
        was kind of nondescript.
    You wouldn't know
    where she was from.
    Now, when she turned around,
    it was the kind of anal sun.
             - Yeah.
   - And it was kind of like,
            oh, okay.
      But her Countess Lady Gaga
             drag I loved.
        - Phenomenal.
       - I loved it
    from top to bottom,
    and everybody knows
    I love a bottom.
        - That hair that she did
                for the Countess
    is so difficult to do.
        To get that type
        of smoothness
   and to get the lace to lay
   that flat is very hard.
    She fucking nailed it.
         - Let's move on
         to Kimora Blac.
- I thought the first look was
not indicative of Vegas to me.
   It was very cheap looking.
    And the Gaga look, to me,
it just seemed like something
you'd see in a bar.
       There's no pizzazz.
    - I think she needs a moment
         to get comfortable.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
        - I love whimsy.
        - Yeah?
- I thought I was being served
        a comedy queen.
    I was left with a little
    drag blue balls with her.
   I didn't get what I thought
       I was going to get.
     - Well, there's so much
         you could get.
    If you're from Milwaukee,
    I mean, you could be
    covered in cheese.
    You could have a wig
    that looks like an udder.
   Like, you can't go halfway.
    - Right. Like, take it
    to the next level.
        - Milk it.
        You milk it.
     - Milk it, honey, yeah.
    - What did you think
    of her interpretation
    of your "Vogue" cover?
        - The hair
    is not what it was.
         My bigger issue
    is I think she's hiding.
     It's about her just letting
    her true self shine through.
    - All right. Let's talk
    about Nina Bo'nina Brown.
    - I was so excited
    when she walked around
          the corner.
     - It's whimsical,
     but it's also fabulous.
    - That insane peach face
         with the head.
        It's so twisted,
   and yet it's so beautiful.
         And this choice
         of the McQueen,
    she makes a statement
    with each piece.
            - She has
     a point of view, yeah.
      - She has a point of view
            as an artist.
        I see a star.
     - Let's move on to Aja.
      - I wasn't blown away
by the Statue of Liberty moment.
        It's okay.
   - Why do you hate America,
Carson?
        (all laugh)
            - I did love
    the Commes des Garcons look,
    but the makeup was real bad.
         - I don't know
   that she nailed it tonight,
         but this girl,
she's gonna keep surprising you.
   - All right. Judges, time
   to fill out your scorecards
        and bring back my girls.
    - The Florida
    election committee
        will be verifying
        these results.
        - (laughs)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
         - Welcome back.
    I've combined
    the judges' scores,
      divided them by five
      and added a 20% tip.
        - (laughs)
    - When I call your name,
    please step forward.
             Eureka.
             - Ooh.
         - Sasha Velour.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        - (gasps) Oh.
    - I wish you could see
    the expression on your face.
        - (laughs)
        - I wish I could see
    the expression on your face.
   Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
             You are
    our top three finalists.
    Now, if for any reason
        tonight's winner
   cannot complete her reign,
the first and second runner-ups
will thumb wrestle
              to determine
      who takes her place.
        (all laugh)
        I hold in my hand
   the name of Miss Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent.
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
 of a fabulous week-long getaway
    to The Grand Resort and Spa,
   Fort Lauderdale's premiere
   gay men's spa resort...
            (inhales)
And the title of Miss Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent...
                The winner is...
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        - Yes!
        (applause)
                - Come on, mama.
     - For them to crown me,
     it means a lot to me.
         Girl, Lady Gaga
         bought my drag.
        She bought it.
    She didn't rent it
     from the Netflix.
        She bought it.
      Validation complete.
    - Is there anything
    you'd like to say?
          - I know that
   this is just the beginning,
but to get you guys' approval
for this means a lot to me.
        Thank y'all
        so much for this.
    I truly appreciate it
    from my heart.
- Well, my queen, go ahead
and serve your public, honey.
    - Yeah. Come on, baby.
            - Yes.
   - Congratulations, darling.
    - Nina Bo'nina Brown.
    Oh, wait a minute.
    Wait a minute.
     Stop the music, please.
    Ladies and gentlemen,
    I have to apologize.
   This is not a Steve Harvey
moment.
       Nina, you are still
               our winner.
      You are still our winner,
            honey, but...
     The real competition
     is just about to begin.
           I'm introducing
     a 14th queen into the race.
            - (gasps)
            - What?
            - Who?
        - Fuck. Oh!
        - Breathe.
    - Please welcome back
       to the race...
       The 14th contestant
        in the 9th season
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
            (screams)
            - Yeah!
                        - Bitch!
     Ru, are you punking us?
        - Oh, my God.
        - No fucking way.
            What?

         - Aw, Jaymes.
           - Oh, no,
  the first lipstick message.
        - I mean, Jaymes
       was very insecure,
    and she just wasn't sure
          of herself.
        And this is such
  a high pressure competition,
      you have to be sure
          of yourself.
          - You know,
   the second she walked in,
  I saw the fear in the eyes.
       And I just saw her
         get defeated.
    - I honestly was really
 surprised I was on the bottom.
             Like,
    I was really surprised.
   I'm feeling so underdogged
  because compared to Jaymes,
   I was like a 10 to a one.
  - How about you, Ms. Winner?
      How are you feeling?
           (cheering)
    - I think you admittedly
    have the least amount of
  experience of all the queens
        and you slayed.
      - I'm very grateful,
  but it's a lot of pressure.
      So I'm very focused
  to deliver to the next level
       every single time.
  - I'm really looking forward
      to knocking you out
   of your winner spot, okay?
          (all laugh)
        - Yes, she's won
     a challenge. Whatever.
         Her confidence
      is definitely ballsy
    for her only doing drag
         for 10 months.
            - Whoo!
       - Is the bride sad
 to take off her wedding dress?
         - I really am.
 - I'm not mad at you for that.
         I understand.
  - I've been praying so hard
   to<i> La Virgen de Guadalupe</i>
   and I feel like she's been
     guiding me through it.
         - It's not fun
     being the bridesmaid.
    I want to be the bride.
  I'm not here to play games.
  The next challenge is mine.
          - The winner
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
           cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special

        It feels exactly
    like I thought it would.
    Okay, guys, after, like,
    the gymnastic challenge,
        what to expect?
        - I'm still sore
       from cheerleading.
            - Girl.
        - So I'm hoping
  it's not anything physical.
    - A knitting challenge.
          (all laugh)
            (siren)
         - Whoo, girl!
     She done already done
          had herses.
   - Oh, my God, oh, my God,
          oh, my God.
     - To become America's
      next drag superstar,
       you have to try on
    a lot of glass slippers,
     kiss a bunch of frogs,
  but don't be an evil queen.
           That role
    has already been taken.
          (evil laugh)
      Hello, hello, hello.
     (cheers and applause)
          - Hello, Ru.
         - Yes, ma'am.
        - Just a little
         leopard print.
          - Now, what
       do you guys think
    of the wax figure of me
 on loan from Madame Tussauds?
          - Gorgeous.
        - I pray to her
      before a challenge.
           - Really?
            - Yeah.
        - Don't you love
        the way her eyes
  follow you around the room?
    It's almost like there's
   a hidden camera in there.
           - (gasps)
  - Watching your every move.
        Maybe there is.
             - Oh!
    - Ladies, don't let this
 devastatingly beautiful queen
       cast an evil spell
       on your charisma,
 uniqueness, nerve and talent.
    Because for this week's
        maxi challenge,
  you need to create a totally
  original fairytale princess.
      - I have no problem
        picturing myself
         as a princess.
        I'm a jappy girl
     who likes nice things.
    - First, you'll come up
     with a memorable name
        and a mythology.
   Then you'll need to design
        a fantasy frock
  to debut on the main stage.
         #DragPrincess
     And to help you bring
  your princess story to life,
    you'll also be creating
       a sassy sidekick.
            - Rawr.
    - And you'll be playing
          both parts.
     - What? We have create
       a little sidekick
       to have our heads
   floating by our character.
         This is nuts.
      Who thinks of this?
 - So, Cinderfellas, feel free
  to use the magical materials
  from the Fabric Planet wall.
 Gentlemen, start your engines
  and may the best woman win.
     (cheers and applause)
            - Whoo!
   - Ooh. How are you feeling
  about this challenge, girl?
      - I feel like I have
      the new age mindset
   to kind of like make this
     extremely avant-garde
       and high fashion.
           - Mm-hmm.
    - So I feel like I might
   have this one in the bag.
    It's a design challenge,
        and I sew 80%--
 no, 95% of everything I wear,
        so I'm known for
   creating different looks,
  and I feel really confident
that this might be my challenge.
        - What the fuck
          am I doing?
         I do not sew.
    I've only made tote bags
          and pillows.
              No.
        - Are you okay?
      - I'm gonna just try
 and make something mermaid-y,
    something under-watery.
          - I'm doing
     under the water, too.
    - Are you doing a fish?
  - I was gonna do a mermaid,
  but then, like, I was like,
    there's too many people
  doing under the water stuff.
            - Great.
            - Yeah.
           I don't--
      Yeah, I'm terrified.
       - Ooh. What's this
   that you got here, Kimora?
 - I'm going to be, obviously,
      Tarzan's other wife.
  - How are you feeling about
   going into this challenge?
   You were in the bottom two
           last week.
      - And you don't sew.
           - I know.
          I don't sew.
    I like to pay designers
       to make my stuff.
     I'm your very spoiled
          drag queen.
          Would Kim K.
    sew her own outfits? No.
  - Well, if you pay designers
       to do your stuff,
    how much will you pay me
    to make your challenge?
           - I mean,
     I have $400 right now.
           - I'll see
      if I have some time.
         - I don't work
        in a sweatshop.
           That's not
     what I signed up for.
     This is not America's
      Next Top Sweatshop.
  - Where you gonna put this?
    Like, on your shoulder?
      - I just got the rat
           for show.
        - Just because.
 - I don't even really want it.
        - Can I have it?
     - Yeah, take it, girl.
          - Thank you.
  I think with this challenge,
      I'm wanting to show
      that I'm not afraid
  to go in a risky direction.
      - What is all these
       cockroaches, girl?
     - That's for my look.
     - What are you doing?
         - Like, sewer
     underground princess.
       Like, very grungy
       and gross kind of.
 Have, like, some kind of shit
     growing off of my face
   and, like, very sewer rat.
      - I have never heard
      of a sewage princess
       in my entire life.
     What kind of princess
            is that?
          Here we go.
   Better watch out, because
 the judges don't play around.
       She could go home.
    - Thank you for the rat.
       - You're welcome.
     - Come on, Templeton.
             - Aah!
         - Coming up...
      You came very close
     to winning last week.
     - Ms. Thang, she won.
     She better watch out.
        Fuck that bitch!
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
      - What's the story?
     - Once upon a time....
           - ♪ Ahh ♪
          - There was
     a beautiful princess.
     - For this challenge,
       we have to create
  a fantasy fairytale princess
     and a sassy sidekick.
      Oh, my God, Trinity,
      you've never looked
         more beautiful
     than you do right now.
       - You're a bitch.
      You're such a bitch.
           - (laughs)
  - So what are you going for?
    You're going for, like,
         sea princess?
           - My whole
       Instagram branding
   is based on the fact that
  I ride the subway to my gig.
          - Okay, yes.
 - So I'm Princess Subway Fish.
   - We were given the brief
        to come up with
a mythological background story
      for our princesses.
         - Introducing
       Princess Forella.
           - Someday,
     she'll be the most...
      What's an adjective?
     What is an adjective?
       Isn't an adjective
       where you, like...
         That's a noun.
         - It's a word
   that describes something.
   - Like, what do you mean?
      - You're beautiful.
  "Beautiful" is an adjective.
         - So beautiful
       is the adjective.
           - Mm-hmm.
 - I'm going to put delicious.
     Is that an adjective?
          Yeah, that's
       a super adjective.
  - Come on, English lessons.
  - Ah, thank God I'm pretty.
      - Hey, kitty girls.
             - Hey.
            - Hello.
   - So how are things going
     in the magic queendom?
            - Great.
            - Good.
        Hi, Farrah Moan.
             - Ru!
             - Ru!
            - Rrrru!
    - What kind of princess
 will you be in this challenge?
        - She's gonna be
    an underwater socialite.
     She's gonna be, like,
on all the underwater tabloids.
          - Oh, okay.
        Now, do you sew?
          - I'm smart
    in a lot of other ways,
  but when it comes to fabrics
     and needles and stuff,
     I'm just not as, uh...
      uh, what's the word?
         - Proficient.
      - Proficient, yeah.
        - It's Season 9.
        How do you walk
       into the workroom
  without knowing how to sew?
        That's just sad.
    - How will you make sure
    that you shine through?
  - Um...I'm just going to be
      my cute little self
        and pray to your
    wax figurine over there
      that y'all like it.
            - Okay.
     Can't wait to see her.
        Thanks, Farrah.
      - Thank you so much.
       - Aja from the BK.
          - Ah, Ru-Ru.
  - Now, you know how to sew,
   so you got lots of skills.
             - Yes.
          - So tell me
      about your princess.
    - Her name is Disastah.
  She is a volcanic eruption,
           basically.
     She's kind of inspired
           by my mom.
      She's like an angry
      Puerto Rican woman.
           - Really.
   - I have a tattoo of her.
        It's right here.
     - That's your mother.
             - Yes.
       When she got mad,
    you see the red come up
       and her baby hairs
    will start crimpling up.
  It's like an eruption, girl.
       - Now, how are you
          gonna shine?
         - I just feel
     so confident about it.
I'm just like, I'm gonna do this
    and it's gonna be cute.
           - You know
    I've heard that before.
       Well, I can't wait
        to see Disastah.
    I'll let you get to it.
           Valentina.
  - I'm ready for my close-up,
          Mr. DeMille.
       - Oh, my goodness.
      Can I see your eyes?
          - Um, well,
     you see, the thing is,
    it's my very first time
       shaving my brows,
  and I'm kind of like nervous
      because I don't have
       my Brooke Shields
    "Blue Lagoon" eyebrows.
     - Oh! Oh, my goodness,
         look at there.
       Why don't you just
      shave them all off?
- Well, because I want to still
have a bit of boy brow to draw.
           - Uh-huh.
     - So that I don't look
       completely crazy.
   - Why are we looking at me
      when you said that?
            (laughs)
    Okay, so I want to hear
      about your princess.
    - She's an ice princess.
  She comes from planet Azula.
   - And that's nowhere near
         Azusa, is it?
      - Not anywhere near
       Azusa, California.
        - Yeah. (laughs)
  - I have a big imagination,
     and I'm really excited
        to get started.
      - See you out there.
         - Thanks, Ru.
       - Trinity Taylor.
          Now tell me
      about your princess.
        What's her name?
      - Farella Aquapussy.
      - She sounds juicy.
           And salty.
      - I kind of like it.
          - I do, too.
          - So tell me
      about her sidekick.
      - Well, her sidekick
    is Stanky the Starfish.
  And I was going to go with,
you know, a chocolate starfish.
           - Uh-huh.
   - But I decided, you know,
           kids want
      bright colors, so...
       - Kids don't know
 they want a chocolate starfish
       until they've had
     a chocolate starfish.
          - Oh, right.
          - You know?
  - I love chocolate starfish.
   - Are you kidding? I live
   for chocolate starfishes.
        But this is not
     a chocolate starfish.
    What kind of a starfish
            is this?
    - Well, he's going to be
      a country starfish.
  - Like from Cracker Barrel?
          (both laugh)
    Now, you came very close
     to winning last week.
     Any bitterness there?
      - No. I came close,
       but you know what?
   I do know that Ms. Thang,
            she won.
          Even though
     she's been doing drag
   a whole lot less than me,
     she's younger than me,
        Fuck that bitch.
           - (laughs)
    - She better watch out.
            - Okay.
       - 'Cause Aquapussy
           is coming.
      - Well, I can't wait
        to see Aquapussy
   out there on that runway.
           - Me, too.
           - (laughs)
       All right, ladies.
  Tomorrow on the main stage,
       you'll be debuting
   your fairytale princesses.
          So good luck
     and don't fuck it up!
   - I don't want to do this.
         I don't know.
         This is hard.
  I don't know what I'm doing.
       I just really want
        whatever I make
      to look good enough
          to be safe,
         because I know
   I'm not going to pump out
        no award-winning
      mermaid gown, honey.
     I just don't even know
        where to begin.
- Why don't you find a glue gun
 and your bra and work on that?
 - You know, I kind of pictured
     gluing fabric on a bra
      being a lot easier.
         This is, like,
      complicated as fuck.
   Like, I don't want to have
   to cut any piece of fabric
     and put it over this.
       - No, you're not.
     - This one won't fit.
  I can't get it to fit over.
             Look.
       - It's okay. Move.
       Sometimes you just
      gotta jump in, girl.
       - Oh, I love you.
        - I love Farrah
      and she's my bestie,
    but she literally sounds
   like a child all the time.
         It would make
    the world of difference
       if she would just
    stop bitching and do it.
       Just do it, girl.
        Don't be afraid
      of hot glue, bitch.
       You a drag queen.
    So what I would suggest
             you do
    is, like, glue shit all
   the way up this one side.
     I'm going to give you
    this base to work with,
       and then I'm gonna
  let you go shell from there.
          Find, like,
  your shiny stuff, seashells.
     - Oh, I broke a piece
       of this starfish.
            - Farrah
   is one of those princesses
   that whines all the time.
          Suck it up.
     This is a competition.
     We're here to compete
         for $100,000.
  One minute you're in and the
next minute, you're gone, honey.
         - Coming up...
    - Are you afraid of what
   America is going to think
         of your makeup
       without face tone?
     - Nope, 'cause I think
    I look almost the same.
       - Awkward silence.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
         - Oh, my God.
         - Get to work.
         - Here we go.
       - Back here again.
  - Good morning, cucu world.
           - (laughs)
    - It's elimination day.
          I'm nervous,
      but I'm also excited
  about my fairytale princess
            outfit.
     I'm about to give them
        Sewer Princess.
    - So when you say cucu,
        is like the hole
    or is it like the butt?
             'Cause
     I'm a little confused.
     - You know, it can be,
      like, the butthole,
       but let me explain
     the story real quick.
      When I was a child,
      mom doesn't want us
   to say bad words at home.
          So one day,
     I was three years old,
    trying to tell her that
  I need to go to the bathroom
        'cause I need to
   from my culo to go ca-ca.
         She slapped me
       with a chancleta.
   She said, like, mira mijo,
   let me tell you something.
 You're not gonna say bad word
      here in this house!
    So I was, like, scared.
    I was, like, what to do?
 I mean, what do you call this
         in your back?
       So scared one day
     after that situation,
      I said, cucu, mama,
     ca-ca, pee-pee. Okay.
        And since that,
          I say cucu.
         - So do I have
        a big cucu, too?
        - Girl, you do.
      Well, I have a cucu,
   but you have a CuCu, girl!
     - Oh, it feels so good
   to have these brows back.
        - I see you had
        an eyebrow lift.
        - Just a little.
    - Are you afraid of what
   America is going to think
         of your makeup
       without face tone?
     - Nope, 'cause I think
    I look almost the same.
       - Awkward silence.
- Everybody can get quiet, but I
think I look the same in photos.
       - Sometimes girls
 that come up via social media
    can get a lot of praise
        for the way they
   present themselves online.
     You got your filters.
     You got your Facetune.
        You got all that.
       However, it's how
     you apply that makeup,
     because sometimes when
   people see you in person,
   they can get a little bit
         disappointed.
         - So, Trinity,
    when you were in Orlando
 when that situation happened,
  like, were you freaked out?
            I mean,
   I know you're from there.
             Yeah.
    - Um, I actually wasn't
in Orlando at that very moment,
     but I'm a very former
          Miss Pulse.
           - (gasps)
   - And I entertained there
   literally the week before
     on their Latin night,
      'cause that happened
      on their Latin night.
         So it's scary
        to think, like,
         that literally
      could have been me.
       And so immediately
        my thought is...
      - Call your friends,
           I'm sure.
  - Oh, my God, who do I know?
         - Did you lose
   a lot of people, Trinity?
     - Well, I didn't know
       any of the people
         that actually
       lost their lives.
         I knew several
      of the entertainers
      that were trapped in
the dressing room that escaped.
   A lady that I worked with
         in my day job,
 one of her daughters had just
   graduated nursing school.
            And then
   her life was taken over...
         - Oh, my God.
     - Like, for no reason.
     - I'm so sorry, girl.
    - Well, let me tell you
   a story about the tragedy.
      - I know you know--
       you probably knew
         a lot of them
      because they were...
   - June 11, I was supposed
     to perform that night,
   but I have to reschedule.
   So Kenya Michaels, that is
 the cast director that night,
        she said, like,
        it's okay, mija.
         We can, like,
        reschedule you.
    And then, like, we were
     performing in Houston
       and we get, like,
       the text message.
       Like, oh, my God,
  we are here in the bathroom.
     We can't do anything.
   There's a guy with a gun,
   like, shooting everybody.
   And I'm like, oh, my God,
        are you serious?
      And, unfortunately,
       one of my friends
     died in that incident,
            Martin.
       And he was, like--
            I'm like
   two or three hours before,
         like, Cynthia,
        you're not here.
        You're supposed
        to have a show.
           That's why
      I came here tonight.
      And I'm like, baby.
         - Oh, Cynthia.
         - No, no, no.
      I just rescheduled.
  Oh. Do you want to go home?
        And he was like,
       no, you know what?
       I'm going to stay.
 I'm going to have a cute time.
      I miss you so much.
           And he was
    one of my first dancers,
       like, 10 years ago
   when I started doing drag.
   So it was a very traumatic
    situation for everybody.
      We never expect that
      a tragedy like this
    happen in our community
     or happen in our clubs
       because we thought
     that we finally built
          a safe place
       for our community.
       - We are not safe
        completely yet,
         and we're not
       accepted 100% yet.
    But we have to continue
       to live our lives.
We can't be stuck in our houses
 and afraid to go out and live.
    - Preach, girl. Preach!
   - What happened in Orlando
       at Pulse Nightclub
  was a defining and shocking
     moment for gay people.
       And the fact that
   it was an act of violence
  against LGBT people of color
   is not insignificant here.
        - Family, famo.
       - Love you, girls.
           - Family.
  - It's so important as queer
 entertainers to lead the way.
    We need to come together
 and be proudly visibly queer.
      - And you know what?
           Also, drag
      is a brilliant place
        to work through
       feelings of pain.
    - Girl, drag is therapy.
            - It is.
   - We can't move backwards.
    We need to stay strong.
        (RuPaul laughs)
        - ♪ Cover girl,

        (RuPaul laughs)
        - Category is...
           First up,
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,

    - Hi, my name is Brulee.
      I'm here to protect
       Princess Cuculina
      from any booty slap
  and to show her that she can
   bring peace, love and sex

          Peppermint,
    Princess Carcinogenetta.
           - My name
    is Petey the Pilot Light
        and I'm flaming.
 I live to help make her dream
  of fire unsafety come true.
  My advice to her is simple.
       Burn, baby, burn.
             Rawr.
 - Oh, it's not just her pussy
        that's on fire.
       (Michelle laughs)
         - Farrah Moan,
       Princess Pacifica.
    - Well, it's the snatch
          of the day.
           - My name
    is Fablina the blowfish.
    I'm Princess Pacifica's
        royal publicist.
        When I first met
       Princess Pacifica,
        she was abusing
      her royal privileges
 by partying from the Atlantic
        to the Pacific.
    I'm here to protect her
 from the grueling sharkarazzi
  and transform her reputation
     from swampy socialite
    to responsible princess
        of the Pacific.
        - Charlie Hides,
      Princess Climaxica.
           - My name
   is Isabella Snatchpacker,
  and I'm Princess Climaxica's
        lady in waiting.
          I first met
       Princess Climaxica
when she was studying languages
     at Galaxy University.
       Oh, she just loves
        foreign tongue.
   She's a cunning linguist,
           you know.
  I'm here to protect her from
 bad puns and double entendres.
        How am I doing?
  - Copper? I hardly know her.
          (all laugh)
           - Eureka,
  Princess You-Reek-of-Daria.
          - Here comes
   Princess You-Reek-of-Daria
    from the sewer kingdom.
   I am her faithful servant
          Woof-train.
          The princess
   was kicked out of topland.
      The army banned her
  to reign only in the sewers.
 I live to help make her dreams
 of being on the top a reality.
       - Alexis Michelle,
     Princess #SubwayFish.
  - My name is #SubwayTadpole,
     Princess SubwayFish's
         chief swimmer.
   We met for the first time
    when Princess SubwayFish
was taking the train to her gig.
  Whenever she bugging, I just
  tell her, just keep fishing.
   - Aw, don't be so crabby.
  - There's a cream for that.
         - Kimora Blac,
     Princess Banana Lady.
   - My name is Funky Monkey,
  Banana Lady's cute bodyguard
      from Banana Kingdom.
    I am here to protect her
from all the big bad jungle men
      with small bananas.
       I love to help her
         make her dream
  of banana digging come true.
        She is so rich,
    she got all the bananas
       she's ever wanted.
         - Nina Bo'nina
      Brown-Pinkett-Smith,
       Princess Zathena.
       - My name is Ink.
    I knew Princess Zathena
       back when she was
 a little hard-headed Martian.
  She was always the wild one
         of the bunch,
        wanting to breed
      with the human race.
     I'm here to teach her
      to love who she is.
    You are from the planet
       Bad Bitch Uranium,
    so you have to represent
      for the bad bitches.
  - I actually had a bad batch
        of Uranium once.
       (Michelle laughs)
   I sold it to the Russians.
     - I remember that day.
        - Sasha Velour,
        Princess Uglina.
      - Where my birds at?
        (RuPaul laughs)
       - My name is Lunk
       from Self Doubtia.
     I'm Princess Uglina's
       imaginary friend.
            It was I
   who trapped her in a cage,
     filling her mind with
    self doubt and weakness.
      But Princess Uglina
      wasn't scared of me.
    She embraced my darkness
      and showed me love,
      so I opened the cage
      and I set her free.
         - Shea Coulee,
       Princess Aquaria.
    - My name is Moon Pearl,
       Princess Aquaria's
     ice fairy from Uranus.
  Princess Aquaria was born in
the battle for love and freedom
   when her star mother fused
  with the Queen Moon Diamond.
  Whenever she's feeling lost,
          I remind her
     that her guiding star
          lives within
   and that she holds the key
         to unlock it.
  She'll be the most sickening
   princess in the universe.
    - Why don't you come up
    and seaweed me sometime?
            No? No?
   Valentina, Princess Vira.
    - Where is Vira's wang?
      - My name is Netty,
Princess Vira's shady godmother.
             I live
     to help make her dream
 of freezing over the universe
      via shade come true.
      My advice is simple:
         hate everyone.
            Someday
    she'll be the shadiest,
   most evilest queen of all
            and live
     hatefully ever after.
   - Aja, Princess Disastah.
        - I almost wore
 that same outfit today, so...
           - Did you?
             - Yep.
     - My name is Dasistah,
  and I am Princess Disastah's
          smoke cloud.
         I live to make
      her dreams come true
         of coal mining
  and becoming a gold digger.
       Someday she'll be
     the most ashy princess
        and she'll live
     flamingly ever after.
       - Orange you glad
    you got fire insurance?
      (Michelle chuckles)
       - Trinity Taylor,
    Princess Aquapussy. Oh.
      - Oh, surf and turf.
           - My name
    is Stanky the Starfish,
  the royal redneck counselor.
          We first met
       when the princess
  was in the waterland clinic
    hitting her itch cream.
    It was for her outbreak,
           clam-idia.
      I hope that someday
     she can find the cure
         for this WTD.
        That stands for
   water transmitted disease.
           - (laughs)
  Ooh, pass the tartar sauce.
          (all laugh)
         - Coming up...
      - I'm no seamstress,
      but that looks like
       a piece of fabric
       around your waist.
        - Your sidekick
      had no personality.
      - Fucking go for it.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome, ladies.
     When I call you name,
      please step forward.
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
         Charlie Hides,
            Eureka,
        Alexis Michelle,
         Sasha Velour,
      Nina Bo-nina Brown,
          Shea Coulee.
      Ladies, you're safe.
    You may leave the stage.
     Ladies, you represent
          this week's
    beauties and the beasts.
             - Oh.
          - Let's hear
        from the judges,
   starting with Peppermint.
   - I just liked the way you
created this kind of fire idea.
      I think the details
  on the dress are impressive.
           - I loved
     Petey the Pilot Light.
          - Thank you.
     When I was a teenager,
  I was cooking at home alone
     and the entire kitchen
        caught on fire,
  and I've been deathly afraid
         of fire since.
           So I said,
      let me do something
     that's going to tackle
            my fear.
           - Only you
   can prevent grease fires.
           - (laughs)
    - Next up, Farrah Moan.
         - Every year,
  Ru and Michelle tell people
    you cannot come out here
     with a piece of fabric
   wrapped around your waist.
     And I'm no seamstress,
      but that looks like
       a piece of fabric
   wrapped around your waist.
- The sidekick, the eye make-up
     thing was distracting
  'cause to me, it looked like
 you were reading a script that
 was maybe down in your hands.
            - I was.
           - Oh, see?
 - I was just kind of let down
      with the character.
   Like, this is your chance,
     so fucking go for it.
    - Up next, Kimora Blac.
            - Hello.
  - You didn't really sell me
   on what your princess is.
            For me,
   that was a little lacking.
           - And then
   your sidekick was robotic
           and really
      had no personality.
       - You seemed like
     you just couldn't wait
      for it to get over.
         - For so long,
    I've been hiding behind
   a breastplate and padding.
        I'm pretty known
          for my butt,
     and I've been padding
          for so long
        that I'm kind of
      uncomfortable again.
      And it's been hard.
   - Thank you, Kimora Blac.
          - Thank you.
     - Up next, Valentina.
         - I wrote down
       Linda Evangelista.
         The smoky eye
  and the nude lip, I like it.
        (RuPaul laughs)
         - This outfit
      is really gorgeous,
       and your sidekick,
   I loved that it was about
         shade and ice.
     - Because oftentimes,
          evil people
  come in beautiful packages,
      as we see every day.
         - Oh, my God.
           - (laughs)
    - Thank you, Valentina.
           - Gracias.
        - Next up, Aja.
         - I literally
       had no clue at all
   what was going on tonight
        with your story
       as your princess.
       - She's a volcano,
      she's from Brooklyn,
      she's from bad side,
          she's banji.
  She's just going to the club
      to go hang out with
  her little clouds and stuff.
    - Did anybody get that?
             - No.
             - No.
      I think that even if
    you wanted to be banji,
    there was a way to do it
      and have it just be
    slightly more polished.
      - I also think that
   your makeup is very dark.
    - Yeah, we can't really
         see your eyes.
  - And it's been kind of dark
      this whole journey.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      Princess Aquapussy.
         - When I first
        heard your name,
      I just kept thinking
        of James Bond...
    (imitating Sean Connery)
    like Princess Aquapussy.
          (all laugh)
          - You know,
       I loved this look.
         I thought that
   from a fashion standpoint,
    that this is really fun.
     And then you showed us
         your starfish.
         - Itch cream.
    - You come across to me
        as pageant girl,
        so seeing you do
     something like Stanky
     is just going to bode
      really well for you.
    Keeping with that comedy
         is a good road
      for you to go down.
          - Thank you.
   - Thank you, my pretties.
  I think we've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
  All right. Now, just between
     us wicked stepmothers,
       what do you think,
   starting with Peppermint?
      - Peppermint made me
   very, very happy tonight.
The minute she stepped onstage,
 you knew what she was selling.
     - I love when someone
   takes an inanimate object
     and makes a character
           out of it.
   - She used something that
  wasn't a really good memory
   and turned it into a plus.
           I thought
       it was very smart.
          Farrah Moan.
  - Obviously, she's gorgeous,
   but there was no presence.
          It was just
      a huge, giant mess.
        - Her blowfish,
      it was a great idea,
           but I left
     a little unsatisfied.
 It just--that closed eye thing
          didn't work.
  I was more distracted by it
    than I was entertained.
 - I have a secret to tell you.
            - What?
   - My eyes have been closed
        the whole show.
       (Michelle laughs)
            - What?
         - Kimora Blac.
        - Funky Monkey.
        It was like that
     Teen Miss USA pageant
  who said, most US Americans
          of the Korea
     or the South Africa...
    - It was hard to watch,
         I have to say.
     - I think we all need
        to take a moment
         to talk about
  the bravest struggle of all,
 coming out here and telling us
     about her struggle...
        - Her struggle.
  - With not wearing hip pads.
    - Not wearing hip pads?
            My God!
        Can you be alive
   and still be made a saint?
       - No, but I think
   we can make arrangements.
           - (laughs)
           Valentina.
       - Three for three.
 Each episode, you look at her
        and we've gotten
         to this point
   where we can't wait to see
      what she looks like
         because she's
     so frigging beautiful,
   we all just want to go up
       and lick her face.
    - Both of her characters
         were stunning
    as far as presentation.
      - And I have to say,
     I was really surprised
        with her comedy.
           I thought
     she really went there.
             - Aja.
     - Aja definitely chose
        the right name:
       Princess Disastah.
           - (laughs)
   - Because that was an epic
     proportion earthquake.
    - I don't understand why
  the chaps with the volcano.
      - Well, the costume
      didn't say volcano.
      It said Heat Miser.
           - (laughs)
       - She's charming,
  but it was a hot lava mess.
       - Trinity Taylor.
   - I liked the whole look.
      It's very Kooky Sue.
 - And then Stanky the Starfish
    was a great counterpart.
          - Clam-idia.
          - It made me
       so frigging happy.
   I couldn't stop laughing.
   - And I also feel that she
 interacted with her character
            more so
   than all the other girls.
    - Really, it can just be
     summed up by one word.
         - What's that?
   - (imitating Sean Connery)
           Aquapussy.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
         Peppermint...
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - Kimora Blac.
  The judges were not a fan of
          your banana.
  I'm sorry, my dear, but you
    are up for elimination.
  - This is the worst feeling
         in the world.
   It sucks to be here again.
       - Trinity Taylor.
   You wished upon a starfish
   and your dreams came true.
       Con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winner
   of this week's challenge.
             - Aah!
           (applause)
- You've won a $2,000 gift card
          from Casper.
          - Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
     - Girl, I finally won
      my first challenge.
        I have arrived,
     and these other girls
       need to watch out.
 - Valentina, your ice princess
        was totally hot.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - Farrah Moan.
        I hate to burst
         your bublina,
    but your blowfish blew.
  Aja, the judges did not lava
    your princess storyline.
    Aja, I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you're up for elimination.
       - I feel confused.
   I definitely think Farrah
  should be in the bottom two,
            not me.
  - Farrah Moan, you may join
        the other girls.
       - Thank you, guys.
             (sobs)
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
       The time has come
          to lip sync
    (echoing) for your life!
           Good luck,
     and don't fuck it up.

         - I'm pretty.
            (laughs)
    I'm a little surprised.
     It's too early for me.
  The judges hated my monkey.
   I hated that monkey, too.
            I think
  what I would do differently
         is to research
     on how to be a monkey,
    'cause that is something
    that I would never think
 I would do in my entire life.
       But I did my best,
     and I looked gorgeous.
     And I want to be known
   as one of the pretty ones.

   - But, you know, I'm here.
      I was diagnosed with
     liver cancer stage one,
      but I'm in remission

           or are you

             (alarm)
             - Ooh!
           - She done
    already done had herses.
       - If you can't love
            yourself,
             let me.
      I'm your biggest fan.
        Your number one.
   Well, technically, only one
    of you can be number one,
       so the rest of you
       are, like, losers.
         Sorry about it.
           (all laugh)
     - Hello, hello, hello!
    (screaming and cheering)
      - Lisa mother fucking
             Kudrow.
          I am gagged.
   - Lady Gaga was just here,
      and now Lisa Kudrow.
  I'm really digging Season 9.
       - Say hi to my pal
          Lisa Kudrow.
      (cheers and applause)
              - Hi.
      - I just ran into her
           on the lot,
   and she wanted to come over
         and say hello.
  - Yeah, you guys look great.
       - Oh, my God, stop.
           - (laughs)
 - Lisa's character Val Cherish
     from the brilliant show
         "The Comeback,"
          is the reason
    I say hello, hello, hello
           every time
    I walk into the workroom.
       Did you know that?
              - No!
      - I didn't know that.
        - Neither did I.
           (all laugh)
   - Now, Lisa, would you mind
      saying that one thing
          that you say
         for me, please?
        - Well, I got it.
           (all laugh)
        - That was good,
   but can you say it happier?
        - Well, I got it.
        - Bigger, bigger.
        - Well, I got it!
           (all laugh)
     Now I look like a fool.
           - (laughs)
    Lisa, come back any time.
         - Okay, thanks.
      - Thank you, darling.
           Mwah, mwah.
      (cheers and applause)
             - Bye!
        - Ladies, I have
  a little secret to tell you.
    When I was a little kid,
  I wanted to be a cheerleader.
           (cheering)
    I loved the short skirts,
       the sassy comebacks
   and the death drop splits.
       So for this week's
         maxi challenge,
       you'll be competing
     in the biggest, baddest
    cheer battle in herstory.
          #QueerCheers.
           (all laugh)
    First, you need to divide
        into two squads.
   Nina Bo'nina Brown, you won
     last week's challenge,
    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
          you're back,
      so I'm making you two
       head cheerleaders.
     Pick your squads. Nina.
         - Shea Coulee.
           - Ha! Aah!
       - Ooh, you playing
         the race card?
           (all laugh)
            Cynthia.
            - Kimora.
              - Oh.
    - My team is going to be
        the Coo-Coo team.
            - Alexis.
            - Eureka!
         - Oh, come on.
             - Aja.
           (applause)
         - Farrah Moan.
       - Oh, team Coo-Coo,
        team Coo-Coo, go!
        - I choose Sasha.
             - Yes!
           (applause)
          - Peppermint.
           (applause)
  - Because I have a heart for
 the underdog, I choose Jaymes.
              - Aw.
              - Aw.
      - She was just doing
       community service.
              - Oh!
          - I'm feeling
     a little self conscious
       about being labeled
          an underdog,
    because I consider myself
     very much a competitor.
          - All right.
        Welcome, Trinity.
              Yes!
       - I choose Charlie.
           (applause)
    - Which means Valentina,
    you're on Coo-Coo's team.
     - I feel like Valentina
         was picked last
             because
     she's already mentioned
   she's only been doing drag
         for 10 months.
   So I think we're all like,
    well, what can she bring?
     - It doesn't feel good
       to be chosen last,
           but little
      do these queens know
       that in their team
     they got the superstar.
   - Team Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       you'll be cheering
       for the home team,
       RuPaul's Glamazons.
          - Yes, honey.
             - Yes.
       - And Team Coo-Coo,
       you'll be cheering
      for our extra special
    guest judges, the B-52s.
             - Yes!
           (applause)
     - Kate, Fred and Cindy
       gave me a big break
when they cast me in their music
     video for "Love Shack."
             - Ooh!
           - Oh, yeah!
     - All right, gentlemen,
       start your engines.
   And may the best woman win.
          - So anybody
    have any insight so far?
       - There's literally
        like an adjective
     for every single queen.
            - Mm-hmm.
          - So I think
    we should go through that
  and assess, like, who matches
    the description the most.
   - Doll, I want to be sassy.
             - Okay.
       - Can I be flirty?
      - You can have that.
       - I think that now
      would be a great time
         for Jaymes to--
     if you want to, like--
        - Yes, to really
          show himself.
- If you do snoozy in funny way,
       it would be funny.
        - I think floozy
         is more my role
      'cause it's all about
           high energy
          and all about
       being over the top.
      - Impact, yeah, yeah.
        - I want floozy.
             - Ooh.
      - Take snoozy, girl.
       It'll be hilarious.
         It'll be great.
         I'm not snoozy.
     I'm just--it's not me.
       - Honestly, Alexis,
           I feel like
       even though, like,
   snoozy may be a challenge,
  I think it's a challenge that
   you can definitely rise to.
   - The other girls assure me
      and encourage me that
     I can make snoozy work.
       You're right, girl.
     I can do any of these.
   - And these are characters.
    - And you're sure you're
     comfortable with that?
    - I'll do whatever, yeah.
       And they're right.
         I'm an actress.
 - Should we, like, stand up and
  do it, just so we have like--
       - Yeah, do you want
       to get it off the--
           - Ru call.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.
    - Jaymes, I'm Jews--ugh.
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.
    - I'm Jaymes and I'm--oh.
  I'm Jaymes and I'm a floozy.
    - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
     I don't think your part
       comes in that late.
   - You got to jump right in.
          - Yeah, yeah.
     - It's got a slow beat
             to it.
    - No, but you have to do
         the first beat.
       - You start in time
and then you stretch the floozy.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.
        - And I'm Jaymes
        and I'm a floozy.
   - Captain, may I speak out
    of turn for a little bit?
          - Of course.
            Go ahead.
             - Girl,
     you gotta sell floozy.
 If you wanted to be the floozy,
    you gotta be the floozy.
          - All right.
 - I'm not seeing it yet, okay?
            I'm not--
    I want to encourage you.
     I'm just saying, do it.
          Do it, girl.
          Come forward.
      - Jaymes doesn't seem
      to be here mentally,
    and this is not the time
    to be figuring out how to
   get your mind in the game.
   It already has to be there.
   - It's gonna be a long day.
         - Coming up...
             - Whoo!
             - Aah!
          - Oh, my God!
      I cannot believe what
    they are asking us to do.
   - There's gonna be a severe
     injury on this episode.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - All right, guys.
    Five, six, seven, eight.
            Let's go!
    - Today's maxi challenge
        is a straight up
       "Bring It On" style
      cheer battle, bitch.
      - Why don't we do it
         one more time.
   I'm gonna sing it with you
    so we can get it in time.
       Let's do it again.
  - This is gonna sound crazy,
     but what if we go back
  to your idea you had before?
           - Of what?
    - Oh, you want to switch?
    - Where I do more of the
  character and you do flirty.
   - Do you want to try that?
              Okay.
             - Yeah.
             - Okay.
    - 'Cause that way, if I'm
  coming right behind somebody,
       it's easier for me
          to keep time.
    - And that's a good idea.
              Okay.
         So I'm gonna--
     we're gonna switch now.
     - We'll switch it out.
  - The decision to have Alexis
  and Jaymes switch characters
     is the right decision.
     We're all thinking it.
      It's gonna be better
     for everyone concerned.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
      - Jaymes, I'm floozy.
    - We are actually rooting
           for Jaymes
     and want him to shine,
       but he's gonna have
      to believe in himself
         to really sell
         this challenge.
    - One, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight.
   - It's time for rehearsal.
       - One, two, three.
           (cheering)
         - Ay dios mio!
   My Coo-Coo is just shaking
           right now.
       - All right, guys.
            I'm Dom.
         I'm a two-time
  world cheerleading champion,
 and I'm here to teach you guys
  a competitive cheer routine.
          - All right.
      - It's gonna consist
        of some tumbling,
   some jumping, some stunts.
           We're gonna
     have to work together,
   but you're also gonna have
    to learn how to stand out
        at the same time.
      We're gonna start it
         with stunting.
        - I am so pissed.
      I don't know who even
    does cartwheels anymore.
   It's not even the eighties.
  - So what you're going to do
       is dip down on one,
            stand up,
       lock out your legs,
   squeeze your tush and hold.
         - Oh, my gosh.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
     One and three, dip one,
          straight leg.
             - Ooh!
             - Wow!
          - Oh, my God!
      I cannot believe what
    they are asking us to do.
     - Dip one, then three.
              - Oh!
        - Okay, make sure
     when you go back down,
            you reach
      for their shoulders.
   - There's gonna be a severe
     injury on this episode.
       - Valentina, ready?
       Dip one, up, three.
   - I was literally shaking,
but I said to myself, Valentina,
      when in doubt, smile.
     - One, two, down three.
     Okay. Can we switch out
         the fliers now?
             Ready.
  And five, six, seven, eight.
     Dip one, straight legs.
              - Oh!
             Bitch,
     I'm scared of heights.
           Oh, my God!
     This is scary as fuck!
      If I fall, it's gonna
        fuck up my face.
         - Then, three.
              - Oh!
            - My face
     is definitely expensive
        and I don't want
        to mess that up.
           No, ma'am.
     Oh, that's not for me.
  - We are feeling the pressure
          and the burn.
        Although the burn
    might be something else.
              - Oh.
          - All right.
             - Yes.
  - We're back in the workroom
    and we're all frantically
         doing our part
     to get our looks ready
   for our cheer competition.
        We have our work
         cut out for us.
      - We all have to look
            amazing.
    - I don't have bloomers.
    - I'm gonna wear tights.
      - Yeah, but you still
    have to have panties on.
      - No, I'm not wearing
      anything underneath.
             - What?
    - So if you go like this,
       it just looks like
         Barbie crotch?
    - Why am I being attacked
        of being a woman?
- Women wear bloomers underneath
   their cheerleading clothes.
     - Not the slutty ones.
           (all laugh)
    Fine, I'll wear panties.
           - (laughs)
 - RuPaul Glamazons, we're gonna
     teach you how to stunt
   so we can do some pyramids.
      Ready, and five, six,
          seven, eight.
     Dip one, two and three.
- Should the inside of the palms
          be together?
     - As close as you can.
             - Okay.
   - Don't think about looking
        straight forward.
   Turn your head to the side.
  You're gonna get a face full.
     - That's not a problem.
           (all laugh)
     - You think you got it?
            - (sighs)
     I'm thinking to myself,
   it's probably not the sport
           for people
    with an AARP membership.
     - And dip one in three.
      Good. Straight arms.
    Try and lift those knees
        up to your chest.
  And five, six, seven, eight.
      Dip one, two, three.
       How are we feeling?
           - Fabulous.
           (all laugh)
        We're gonna need
         stunt doubles.
- You guys, I can't even believe
     I'm still stoning this.
          Like, this is
        hard labor work.
           This is why
    I pay people to do this.
      - Stoning really does
          feed my soul.
       - It does me, too.
      I love to put sparkle
         on everything.
            - I think
    when you stone anything,
       it's just an excuse
          to look great
         without really
        even being great.
   Stoning is for ugly girls.
       Don't get me wrong,
     but I think all of us,
       we kind of grew up
     differently, you know.
    Like, some of us love to,
      like, create things.
       - Well, some of us
         don't love it.
   Some of us have to do this
           to survive.
         Sewing all day
       makes my back hurt,
      and I eventually get
     so creatively exhausted
       that I just despise
  looking at my crafting room.
         But I know that
     if I don't go in there,
 I'm not gonna be able to go to
the buffet that I want to later.
           (all laugh)
     - Sister, I'll take you
     to the buffet with me.
         - Well, bitch,
     you take me to a buffet
   and I'll sew you something.
    - So can you finish this
          for me then?
      - Kimora is gorgeous,
      but that attitude...
      - I'm getting tired,
       I'm getting thirsty
     and I'm getting, like,
       anxiety right now.
        - Not cute, girl.
              - Oh!
         - Coming up...
             - Wait!
        - Uh, this is my
      virgin de Guadalupe.
 I've really been praying to her
       every single night.
       - You crazy, bitch.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
             - Yay!
             - Yeah.
       - Day two, whores.
   - Glamazons are gonna kick
        the B-52s asses.
      - So today is the day
     we're about to perform
       this mother fucking
        cheer challenge.
          - Wait! Girl!
         Do you really?
        - Oh, this is my
      virgin de Guadalupe.
   I wish I could turn her on,
but I really been praying to her
       every single night
      just to watch over me
          and guide me
      through this process.
         - Who, Madonna?
              - No,
     la virgin de Guadalupe.
       - You crazy, bitch.
     That's some crazy shit.
           - Everybody
    gets to have a drag mom,
         but I feel like
     la virgin de Guadalupe
         is my drag mom.
     She helped get me here.
           She's gonna
        help me win, too.
      (praying in Spanish)
       Please help me win
         this challenge.
         I need to win.
      Love you, thank you.
          - Did you do
       high school sports?
   - I played tennis and then
   I did swimming and diving.
     And I think the diving
      kind of helped me out
     with this a little bit.
       - Yeah. Girl, I did
    high school cheerleading.
             - Yes.
       - We never did no--
          Girl, it was
      a black high school.
      We, like, you know...
        - Right. (laughs)
       - I'll never forget
        I was in the gym
   with all the cheerleaders.
  Some of the girls were like,
      oh, what do you think
  about that basketball player
           over there?
         He was so fine.
            - Boing.
        - Like, gorgeous
           cocoa skin.
         And I was like,
    oh, he's cute, he's cute.
     And later on, at lunch,
I see the entire basketball team
          looking at me
    like I'm about to get it.
    So I get up and I'm like,
  let me get out of here early.
          I'm by myself
        in the stairwell,
 and the entire basketball team
       comes up the steps,
       and one of the boys
    beats the hell out of me.
            - (gasps)
           - No, Pep.
          - It's true.
      But afterwards, I was
    talking to the secretary,
     told her what happened.
        And you know how
     the high school offices
           have, like,
       all glass windows.
            - Uh-huh.
      - So I turned around,
          and I swear,
        the entire school
         was just there.
          It felt like
        a circle of love.
    Like, people were crying,
   my friends were out there.
     So I felt pretty good,
            you know.
      And he got expelled.
           - Right on.
       - I stayed captain
   of the cheerleading squad.
           - Come on.
  - When I was in high school,
        I was singled out
      for being different.
      After that incident,
         I had strangers
       reaching out to me,
      and I knew right away
        that I was loved,
      and that felt great.
      - Cynthia, your story
        really touched me
      because I have a lot
     of people in my family
      who have had cancer,
    and, like, and who have--
         who have passed
        because of that.
          - Oh, my God.
  - I just wanted to make sure
    that you're okay, because
      I know your struggle
  which was hard, and it really
        touched my heart.
          - Thank you.
           Girl, whoo!
        It's a challenge.
   Everything was a real mess.
     I get my results and it
   was liver cancer stage one.
      So I was like, what?
   You know, I mean, I just...
     I was living my dream,
     and now I need to face,
       like, liver cancer.
           I was sad.
        I was really sad.
     It's hard when you know
     that you have a disease
       and maybe probably
       could be, you know,
   the last days of your life.
             I mean,
  the immune system goes down.
         So even a cold,
     it can possibly, like,
     kill you, so, I mean--
     - It's unreal to think
       that you could die.
        - At any moment.
          - Any moment.
     - But let me tell you.
        I'm in remission.
    - Cynthia is living proof
   that cancer is not the end.
       - Whoo! Group hug.
      We need a group hug.
         - If anything,
  she's stronger competing now.
    It has given her a drive
       to really succeed,
       and she's doing it
           with beauty
   and with a sense of humor,
   and that's a drag we need.
  - #KickingCancerintheCooCoo.
           (cheering)
         (RuPaul laughs)
         - ♪ Cover girl,
   put the bass in your walk ♪
         ♪ Head to toe,
   let your whole body talk ♪
            And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
      My head cheerleader,
        Michelle Visage.
        How's your head?
          - Haven't had
         any complaints.
           - (laughs)
And everybody's grooving because
         it's the B-52s.
      Hey, is your tin roof
          still rusted?
          - Ooh, yeah.
           - Oh, yeah.
          - Yeah, baby.
          - This week,
    our queens are competing
     in the biggest, baddest
       cheer battle ever.
       Let's check in with
   our very own Ross Mathews.
           - Yes, Ru,
      this is so exciting!
         It smells like
          queen spirit.
          I'm actually
       literally gagging.
          Back to you.
         - Thanks, Ross.
       We'll be watching.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
          Coming up...
             - Whoo!
              - Ow!
          (bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
      - It's the "RuPaul's
           Drag Race"
   Cheer Battle Extravaganza!
       RuPaul's Glamazons
    versus the B-52 Bombers.
           - Ru call.
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.
     - I'm Shea, I'm flirty.
     - I'm Sasha, I'm dirty.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Jaymes, I'm snoozy.
          - I'm Alexis
        and I'm a floozy.
      All: We are RuPaul's
           Glamazons.
   Got our tucking panties on.
    Our beat is unstoppable.
    Our wigs are unclockable.
    All: All right, work it,
       work it, all right.
    - B-52 Bombers, let's go!
   - I'm Coo-Coo, I'm naughty.
    - I'm Kimora, I'm slutty.
    - I'm Eureka, I'm wacky.
    - I'm Trinity, I'm tacky.
    - I'm Farrah, I'm thorny.
        - I'm Peppermint,
           I'm corny.
        - I'm Valentina,
         I'm also corny.
           (all laugh)
        All: Our lobsters
          are rocking.
    Our love is in the shack.
          We're roaming
        'cause we wanna,
      so haters step back.
         ALL: B-50-who?
       Not as cool as Ru.
      RuPaul is more fierce
    than Kate could ever be.
      More woman than Fred
    and more man than Cindy.
    All: RuPaul is shameless,
  selling candy bars and more.
             - Ugh!
   All: She even had a perfume
    and it was called Whore.
           (all laugh)
   All: Your beehive's busted.
    Your songs are too slow.
      You should go retire
      in a private Ida-ho.
         - And it's time
    for the tumbling package.
         (whistle blows)
        - Yeah, big girl.
      Come on, bitch, yes.
           Holy fuck.
             I land
     and I feel my knee pop.
   But I knew there was no way
         I was stopping.
      Bitch, I'm on a roll.
             - Whoo!
             - Aah!
   - Now, that was impressive.
    - Valentina surprised me.
    I feel a little bit like,
           oh, my God.
       I choose her last,
      but she came to slay.
       - Ms. Jaymes? Girl.
             - Whoo!
             - Whoo!
         - There we go.
          (horn blows)
  - Now the ladies will move on
       to the group dance.
             - Whoo!
              Whoo!
      (cheers and applause)
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
      - Glamazons, Bombers,
      the battle raging on.
     This cheer ain't over.
        Now bring it on!
    - When I get all the way
         up to the top,
        I feel like, yes,
       I'm a cheerleader.
              - Oh!
             - Whoo!
      (cheers and applause)
 - The judges are going to have
 a tough time scoring this one.
      I feel bad for them.
            Oh, wait.
        I'm a judge. Uh.
        - The category is
      white party realness.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Zeta Jones.
    - Glamazon Shazaam-a-zon.
   - When Nina Bo'nina Banana
      Osama bin Laden Brown
     hits the runway, child,
        I'm a bad bitch.
   - Hungry, hungry hip pads.
             - Ooh.
       - Alexis Michelle.
       - Do these earrings
      make my ass look fat?
     - I'm serving glamour,
    but I've got it turned on
   its ear just a little bit.
       - Tin roof frosted.
           (all laugh)
          Shea Coulee.
         - I'll have two
     vanilla cones, please.
   - I'm serving you chocolate
     sixties bodacious babe.
         - Remember when
   we used to do white lines?
             - Whoo!
           - (laughs)
        - Charlie Hides.
       - Very Linda Evans
         from "Dynasty."
    - The outfit is amazing.
      I look like a fashion
 illustration of the Snow Queen.
           - You know,
      she's from the hood.
         - Sasha Velour.
     - I've taken a classic
    silhouette and updated it
  with a commitment to showing
      women who are strong.
 - You know what they say about
   girls who wear white pumps.
         - True hooker.
            - Mm-hmm.
             - Aja.
     - Where's my fava beans
          and chianti?
       - I believe that's
  a whitening strip, actually.
       - I'm an Illuminati
            princess.
    They tried to silence me,
    and I'm like, no, bitch,
      I'm still gonna talk.
     - Now you Khali-see me,
         now you don't.
             - Hmm.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
       - Gentlemen prefer
          a white muff.
        - My look is fun.
           It's campy.
        I look fabulous.
    - The girl can't help it.
     - Oh, I'm sure she can.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   - Oh, my goodness, I think
      I'm having a déjà Ru.
         - I'm going to
       the most expensive
     white party ever, okay?
       - My fair Coo-Coo.
           - (laughs)
         - Farrah Moan.
    - I like the peek-a-boos.
        - I'm giving you
      a little bit of ass,
      a little bit of class
     and some broken glass.
   - She is quite the hipster.
           Valentina.
              - Oh.
           - Nice day
      for a white wedding.
    - I'm inspired by my mom
    and dad's wedding video.
     My mom was known as the
beautiful bride in her hometown,
           and I want
     to tell you that story.
- If anybody has any objections,
        shut the fuck up.
        - Yeah. (laughs)
         Trinity Taylor.
     - I think a UFO landed.
   - My ass looks really good
      in these white pants.
  They look like two snowballs
         just juggling.
  - I hear she comes in piece.
           (all laugh)
         - Kimora Blac.
          - Now that's
     my kind of patriotism.
  - I'm going to a white party
            on a boat
        with hot sailors,
    and we're gonna have fun.
  - I don't think she'll sink,
             do you?
        - She comes with
    her own flotation device.
           Peppermint.
        Ooh, winter mint.
          - I've chosen
    an Elvis Presley-inspired
   rock 'n' roll extravaganza.
      - That pearl necklace
      seems to be dripping.
            - Eureka.
    Honey, it's milking time.
            - Uh-huh.
    - I'm giving you glamour,
    androgynous Glamazonian,
         big tuna fish.
            - Eureka,
    like the vacuum cleaner?
    - Yes, and she can suck.
 - Maybe I won't have my mother
        watch this show.
           (all laugh)
         - Coming up...
   - You were so fun to watch.
      - Space age fashion,
           I adore it.
  - You're like a drug dealer.
     Gave me a little dose.
         I wanted more.
           (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome, ladies.
            This week
     you competed as teams,
      but you'll be judged
         as individuals.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        Alexis Michelle.
          Sasha Velour.
              Aja.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
          Farrah Moan.
           Peppermint.
             Eureka.
      Ladies, you are safe.
           - (exhales)
          - Thank you.
   - You may leave the stage.
            It's time
  for the judges' critiques...
   Starting with Shea Coulee.
  - Tonight, you are giving me
      this futuristic look
  with hair that hearkens back
         to Barbarella,
   and I'm really feeling it.
   - And the routine you did,
       you were fantastic.
  - She did some amazing flips,
    and I made note of that.
         - You could see
      the humor there, too.
   - As a kid, I wanted to be
  like Dominique Dawes so bad,
  but my parents were like, uh,
you can do that in the backyard.
      We ain't putting you
         in no lessons.
           (all laugh)
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.
     Next up, Charlie Hides.
     - I didn't remember you
    from the acrobatic thing.
   - I tried to star everyone
that I really thought stood out.
   - Did Charlie have a star?
              - No.
    - But I'll tell you this,
  you seized me on the runway.
   This look is just so good.
          - Thank you.
           - Up next,
        Jaymes Mansfield.
              - Hi.
        - The way you pad
          is glorious.
     You're giving me, like,
       saddlebag and hips.
            It's hot.
        But in the cheer,
      I don't remember you,
      and that's not good.
  I think you like to consider
    yourself a comedy queen,
  but I haven't found anything
     funny coming from you.
           I feel that
   you're unsure of yourself.
     You have to believe it
      in order to sell us.
            - You do
      this airhead shtick,
  and I think if you committed
   all the say, it'd be great.
     And I think that's what
     Michelle's getting at,
        is the confidence
         to commit 100%,
         and I feel like
          it's at 20%.
      - Next up, Valentina.
         - I loved this
      virginal Latina bride
      down to the crossing
          of yourself.
      It was also beautiful
  all the way down to the nude
       and not white shoe.
   But we won't bring that up.
           (all laugh)
     Now, the cheerleading,
      what I loved the most
       was that even when
     the lights weren't on,
   I was watching you, and you
    were fully in character.
     And it just--it was so,
       like, "SNL" moment.
        - I found myself
        looking for you.
   You're like a drug dealer.
   You gave me a little dose.
         I wanted more.
           (all laugh)
    Keep it up, or as you say
          in Spanish--
     I don't know how you--
  I don't know how to say that.
           (all laugh)
   - Next up, Trinity Taylor.
            - You had
     the toughest job of all
     as the ultimate flier,
  and you were so fun to watch.
          - And I think
    this outfit's fantastic.
         Beyond Mugler.
          - Thank you.
     - Up next, Kimora Blac.
     - What stood out to me
     was the wig you had on,
 but you didn't really stand out
          athletically.
     - And that's not good.
  - Tonight, probably my least
     favorite on the runway.
       If I looked at you,
     I'd automatically think
         nautical theme.
  I wish the gloves were white
     and the bra was white.
      I know it sounds like
      it's a lot of white,
     but it's a white party.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   I think we've heard enough.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
     All right, just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think,
   starting with Shea Coulee?
  - I thought she was the best
   in the athletic department,
          and I thought
    she looked great tonight.
       I love that outfit.
   - In terms of star quality,
           she has it.
      But I think she needs
  to have some kind of padding.
        She's got thighs,
   but she ain't got no booty.
   - All right. Let's move on
        to Charlie Hides.
  - In the cheerleading thing,
  she had this great character
            of Boozy.
 You, out of everybody, Charlie,
 could've taken it all the way.
          - But Charlie
        looked beautiful,
 certainly carried herself well
         on the runway.
   - I'm eager to see what she
 pulls out of her suitcase next,
       but she better pull
      personality out, too.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
    - Listen, you got a name
     like Jaymes Mansfield,
       you better deliver.
        - I used to watch
        "The Match Game,"
    and Jayne Mansfield would
     come on every so often
        and had a wiggle
          in her walk.
     Jaymes needs more voom
         in his vah-vah.
 - She wants to portray herself
   as this comedic character,
       when I don't think
        that character's
    completely realized yet.
     - Jaymes' audition tape
     was so funny, I got it.
    I understood the shtick.
  But I think that since she's
    been in this competition
      with the other girls,
        she's thrown off.
             - Yeah.
          - Valentina.
      - Valentina, rrrrrrr.
           (all laugh)
        As a cheerleader,
      she really stood out
  with her facial expressions.
        She just made you
           notice her.
     - And I thought she was
    the best dressed tonight.
   I thought she was stunning.
  - Michelle, you did clock her
       on her nude shoes.
          - I'm sorry,
  I just couldn't let that go,
         because she was
    so flawless head to toe,
      why wouldn't she put
        a white shoe on?
       Why would she throw
         a nude clunker?
 - Well, maybe she was thinking
  something old, something new,
       something borrowed,
         something nude.
           (all laugh)
       - Someone you blew.
           (all laugh)
        - Trinity Taylor.
           - I thought
    it was really impressive
       how both characters
   were completely different.
           I wouldn't
      have recognized her.
- Tonight on the runway, though,
   it wasn't my favorite thing
    'cause we've kind of seen
  a lot of this over the years.
           - I thought
      it was very original.
      - Space age fashion,
   I mean, that's total B-52.
           I adore it.
         - Kimora Blac.
     - I didn't remember her
      from the competition,
         and that wasn't
       my favorite outfit.
           - I thought
        she was a newbie.
      - I know why you got
        that impression,
       because she paired
     so many different looks
       onto that one look.
            - Right.
     - Where someone who's a
seasoned prostitute would have--
     would have just chosen
        the nautical hat.
    It actually accented her
   inability to tell a story.
       - She's got so much
         going for her,
  the look, the face, the body,
    the confidence on stage.
   But in terms of who are you
         as a performer,
          I don't know,
   but I know I want to know.
      - All right. Silence!
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Shea Coulee.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
   On the runway, you gave us
        bombshell floozy,
     but your cheer routine
    was a little too snoozy.
     I'm sorry, my dear, but
   you're up for elimination.
       - It's frustrating.
     What I'm trying to show
  the judges isn't translating,
     and I don't really know
  what else they want from me.
        - Trinity Taylor.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
          - Valentina.
     Your cheer engaged us,
     and your bridal runway
      made me say, "I do."
         Sissy-boom-bah,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
You've won a custom wig wardrobe
      from Rock Star Wigs.
      - Thank you so much.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
         Charlie Hides.
    You scored on the runway,
     but your cheer routine
  did not meet our squad goals.
   Kimora Blac, in the cheer,
        you disappeared.
   And in white, you got read
       for being too blue.
        Charlie Hides...
          You're safe.
     - Thank you very much.
    - Kimora Blac, I'm sorry,
            my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
        Prior to tonight,
    you were asked to prepare
     a lip sync performance
         of "Love Shack"
          by the B-52s.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            (thunder)
     To lip sync for your...
          (echo) life!
       - It really starts
           to sink in.
       The pressure's on,
    because I'm performing it
           in front of
      the B-52s themselves.
           - To put me
    on the bottom two first?
       Jaymes, watch out.
          - Good luck.
      And don't fuck it up.

   Well, that didn't quite go

       <i> - Previously on</i>
    RuPaul's Drag <i> Race...</i>
        We're throwing
    the gayest ball ever!
          - I think
    that the dance element
   is not your comfort zone.
       - To be honest,
 I was not being listened to.
 - I don't think you stood up
     as a leader, though.
         You sort of
    explicitly trust Shea.
       - Actually, no.
       I felt like Shea
   was stepping on my toes
        a little bit.
     - It ain't <i> RuPaul's</i>
  <i> Best Friend Race no more.</i>
         -Peppermint.
  -Your unicorn, it was fun,
        but there was
      a little bagginess
           going on
    in the crotch-al area.
       - Alexis Michelle.
     - I feel if we take
  the bow out of your head,
    I can get that outfit
         at Ricky's.
         - Shea Coulee.
         - It's like
a street style model off duty
         meets couture.
       I hope we share
        the same size.
     - You're the winner
  of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
        - Peppermint,
      shantay you stay.
       Alexis Michelle,
         sashay away.
             - Ooh.
             -Oh.
             -Oh.
    - Our heart is broken
       for our sister.
Alexis really wanted to make it
to the top of this competition.
  Unfortunately, I feel like
      this was her time.
     - "Wishes come true,
          not free.
   You're my sisters always."
      Alexis, we love you.
 -We love you so much, girl.
      -We love you, sis.
        - It feels bad
    coming in the top four
   just having lip synched
         for my life.
         So whatever
    the next challenge is,
        I need to rock
     the shit out of it.
       Congratulations
     to Ms. Shea Coulee!
  - I won four challenges now,
      so come on, Mama Ru.
           Tch-tch.
       Hand it on over.
    - I will say I thought
  this was gonna be my week
  'cause I actually did have
       a rainbow look.
            - Oh!
         [all laugh]
        - [cough cough]
     Shea might have won
       this challenge,
  but I will get that crown.
          [chuckles]
     - We are the top four.
            -Four!
         -All right!
       - Can I just say
     this is the top four
   that I really wished for?
        - Bitch, please.
      Don't get me wrong.
   I love these other girls,
    but I want to make it
      in the top three.
    Somebody needs to go.
         It ain't me.
   Enough talking about it.
    Let's get done, honey.
    - These girls are major
        and all of us
  are hungry for that crown,
   so I may have to resort
       to other means.
I don't know what that means.
           [laughs]
       That sounds shady.
            It did.

     [cheers and applause]
   This is your last chance
      to prove to RuPaul
         that you're
     top three material.
     To help you stretch
  your charisma, uniqueness,
       nerve and talent,
    you'll be working with
 the incredible Todrick Hall.
       [gasps and cheers]
           He's back.
           [cheering]
         And he's not

      First, each of you
  needs to write and record
    an original verse for
 the sickening Season 9 remix
   of RuPaul's <i> Category Is.</i>
     [cheers and laughter]
      Then you'll put on
      your dancing shoes
          and learn
  some killer choreography.
            -Ooh.
            -Ooh.
        - And tomorrow
      on the main stage
       you'll be making
      your all-singing,
         all-dancing
  <i> Category Is </i> world debut.
             - Wow.

   an album out on iTunes.
            - Whoo.
    - What are you ladies
      thinking of doing?
      Singing or rapping
    or, like, spoken word?
    - I think I'm gonna rap.
     - Mine is definitely
         spoken word.
    I don't know how to rap.
           - [laughs]
     - Well, I can't sing,
    so I don't really know

             - Hi.
       -Hello, ladies.
       -Hi, Peppermint.
      - I used to watch
       <i> The RuPaul Show</i>
     with Michelle and Ru,
    and here I am a guest
      on their podcast.
    It's a dream come true.
  - You made it all the way
         to top four?
            - Girl.
   - But, you know, for us,
we see the girls year after year
         and I think
    the biggest challenge
   is for them to get past
their conception of themselves.
           -Mm-hmm.
-Have you been able to do that?
            - Yes.
   Before the competition,
   I really had a hard time
          balancing
     kind of my day life
      and my night life.
- Because I know that you have
 revealed that you are trans.
     You're a trans woman.
         Is that what
     we're talking about?
        Is that what--
            - Yes.
 I mean, a really well known
     and respected queen
    back in New York said,
        oh, you know,
     are you transitioning?
      'Cause if you are,
      I'll support you.
           But then
    she immediately said,
         but you know
      you'll never work
  in the gay community again
       as a drag queen.
     - But that's not true.
  - I see that now, but that
  scared the shit out of me.
        -For how long?
           -Years.
           -Years?
  -Until a couple weeks ago.
  I still worked and I still
   continued my transition,
but it made me kind of push them
to opposite ends of the room.
 - You don't ever need to be
       one or another.
  Nobody has to put anybody
    in any kind of a box.
 - I definitely didn't think
      being a drag queen
       and a transwoman
       would ever mix.
           And now,
    after this experience,
 I know that those two things
         can coexist
     if that's who you are,
      and that's who I am.
- Thank you so much, Peppermint,
     for being so honest.
        You is a marvel.
           - [laughs]
     - I'm ready to hear
        what you got.

      - Sasha can't dance.
          - [exhales]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
        - Oh, my God,
       look who's here.
-Hello, you beautiful legends.
             -Hi.
      - It's time to do
the <i> What's The Tee? </i> podcast
    with Ru and Michelle.
      I'm really excited
  to get to spend some time
    hanging out with them.
 - When you look at yourself
     in this competition,
    what were your missteps?
      - The biggest was
   how I tackled <i> 9021-Ho.</i>
      I thought I could
   think my way into humor.
             - Hmm.
       - But turns out,
  that doesn't work so well.
             - No.
       - And what about
     in life in general?
    - I think a lot about
 my relationship with my mom.
  She passed away last year,
       and I feel like
  there were a lot of missed
opportunities for us to connect.
         I'm not sure
  she ever really got to see
       the type of drag
      that I believe in.
  - But she knew you did drag.
  - She knew I did drag, but
I could have shared it with her.
        -Included her.
            -Yeah.
      My mom was always
     a little bit unsure
   about why I was doing drag
    because she didn't see
  how it could be a career.
    But she was interested.
    Especially in the last
  couple months of her life,
    she wanted nothing more
  than to see what direction
  my life was going to take,
  and I didn't really open up.
  I think all the time about
how it must have felt for her
  feeling like she was going
   to miss out on so much.
  That loss made me realize
the importance of opening up.
  My dad has fallen in love
          with drag.
          Papa Velour.
        -Papa Velour.
        -Papa Velour.
     - That's what people
       always call him.
          [all laugh]
      - Well, thank you,
        Sasha Velour,
       and give my love
       to your father.
           - I will.
    -But before you go...
            -Yes.
   -We have a parting gift.
             -Oh.
         - What is it?
      - Today's podcast
is sponsored by Squatty Potty.
   Best poop of your life,
            kiddo.
         Guaranteed.
     - Thank you so much.
 You know, I'll write a whole
  philosophy piece about it.
          [all laugh]
        - Hey, Todrick.
       -How you doin'?
    -I'm doin' good, baby.
       -We're twinning.
             -Ow!
             - Ow.
       - I love to sing,
        I love to rap,
    and I love to perform,
      and that's exactly
   what this challenge is.
         I'm gonna win.
     - Let's just dive in.

      - Fricka-fricka-ree.
      - How are you guys?
          - Hi, Shea.
  - Shake a leg, Shea Coulee.
  Now, somebody told me you
 were teased a lot as a kid.
  - Yes. Where we lived was
 a mostly white neighborhood,
      and so I was teased
    because I was the only
     black kid, you know.
    They'd call me Blackie.
           And then
     I would go to church
     and then they would
        make fun of me
      because they said
      I spoke too white.
 So I really didn't feel like
 I belonged much of anywhere.
      And it really took
          doing drag
      to become stronger
     and more confident.
         It's my armor.
       - When you went
       to this church,
       did you get into
   the spirit of the Lord?
       - Oh, girl, yeah.
       I used to shout
 and I used to buck and jive
    and throw it all around.
  -Did you speak in tongues?
          -Oh, yes.
     Boon shaka-la-la-la,
halla-la-la-la, halla-la-la-la.
          [all laugh]
    - So it's shah la-la...

        - I'm familiar
        with that one.
       I know that one.
    That was at my church.
       - Yeah. [laughs]
         - I love it.
            -Yes.
        -Hey, listen,
         we actually
 have a parting gift for you.
      - It's going to be
       your very own--
     - Oh, my God, shut up!
            - Yes.
       - The Squatty--
            -Yes!
            -Yes!

            -Bye.
            -Bye.
      - That bitch knew
   what Squatty Potty was.
         - Hell, yes.
 Squatty Potty ain't no joke.
          - I love it.

  For somebody who's coming up
        for the finale
   of <i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
       it just doesn't
        seem powerful.
     You're a drag queen.
    You know what I mean?
  I feel like it needs to be--
     - But I'm this kind
   of drag queen, Todrick.
- I'm not saying you need to be,
  like, popping your tongue
        and giving us
       Alyssa Edwards,
        but right now,
     it just sounds like
     you're saying lines
      into a voicemail.
           - Oh, God.
        It's important
       to show Todrick
       I can be a star
     and still be myself.
       - Play the track.

  How'd you feel about that?
          - Better.
       You were right.
           - [laughs]
      - Now, you're from
     Birmingham, Alabama,
     and you were raised
    by your grandparents.
            - I was.
     - What do they think
   about you as a showgirl?
        - I never told
       my grandfather,
 although I think he probably
    found a couple of wigs
      under a towel once
   and didn't say nothing.
          -[laughs]
       -Uh-huh, uh-huh.
     - Now, my grandmother,
  she had a really hard time
      with me being gay.
     And towards the end
  we had a big falling out,
         even though
  I was taking care of her.
    - Was the falling out
   over your homosexuality?
           -It was.
        -Or the drag?
  - It was over me being gay.
We got into a really big fight
      before she passed,
        and I told her
      that I hated her.
      I didn't mean that,
   but it's something that
haunts me, like, still today.
    Like, I just wish that
  wouldn't have been, like,
    one of the last things
         I told her.
            - Right.
       - I don't know.
          I just...
     There's a lot about
the last few months of her life
      that I just don't
      have closure with.
         Like, I just--
   I wish there would have
   been more conversations.
         I wish there
  would have been more time.
       I can't go back
        and be, like,
  I'm sorry that I said that
    'cause she's not here.
       - Yeah. My guess
  is that if she were here,
     she would forgive you.
          - I hope so.
       - No, she would
   definitely forgive you.
        She would say,
  I am so proud of my baby.
        - She sounded
       just like that.
           - [laughs]
     - I didn't want her
        to ever think
that I really didn't love her,
        because I do.
   She was the best parent
    I could have ever had.
     - There are my queens.
       How y'all doin'?
            - Hey.
  - Good work earlier today,
      but the challenge
   is just about to really
    get started right now.
      It's time to learn
      your choreography
     for the performance
          tomorrow.
   My goal is to challenge
     every single person
           based on
     their own skill set.
   I really want to push them
     because that's what
  this competition is about.
    Let's go, Peppermint.
          You ready?
      - All right, baby,
          I'm ready.
      - So I want to see
   if you can sit like this
   so they can go like that.
      - This performance
  determines the top three.
       I cannot afford
to drop the ball on this one.
   -Bring it to the runway.
         -Two, three.
        - Cut, cut, cut.
        - Let's do this.
       - Let's try that
        from the top.
    Five, six, seven, walk.
          Bring Keith.
         Put her down.
      Left, right, left.
         Right, left.
         Awesome. Cool.
        Next up, Sasha.
      Okay, can you just
        do fast walks?
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,
      gah-gah-gah, boom.
     And then, walk, walk,
    five, six, seven, fall.
          -[exhales]
       -Can we try it?
            - Sure.
  - What is Todrick thinking?
       Sasha can't dance.
    - One, two, three, four.
      Down, down, turn,
         six, seven.
         - Oh, my gosh.
 - Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun,
      dun-dun-dun, boom.
      This should be fast.
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,
      gah-gah-gah, boom.
      - I'll do my best.
            Sorry.
       - Let's go back.
   Five, six, seven, eight.
  - I'm really--I'm honestly
       trying my best.
       I want to nail it,
but I just maybe won't get it,
      like, immediately.
 - But do you feel confident
that you can do this on stage?
     - I do feel confident.
   - Because if you don't,
   you should tell me now.
   - I feel like I can do it,
  but it is a huge challenge
   that I want to rise to.
           - Good.
     I like to hear that.
  - Girl. Sasha is up there
  looking like she's shook.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
   - She's just been up here.
      - I'm a huge fan.
  She's got the real goods.
           - Oh, no.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         - All right.
  Let's move on to Trinity.
      - We're rehearsing
       our choreography
      for our main stage
         performance
       of <i> Category Is </i>
      with Todrick Hall.
          - You ready?
          - I mean,
    I'm gonna have to be.
           - [laughs]
   - I am extremely nervous.
- So can you go, what category
     are we on right now?
  - What category are we on
     ri--oh, wait, wait.
   Yeah, it's in a--okay, so.
       What category--
   - What category are we--
       - What category
     are we on right now?
       - What category
     are we on right now?
      - What dance move
       is coming next?
       - What category
     are we on right now?
    - Okay. I can get it,
but it's gonna take practice.
   - The problem with Trinity
   is that her rhythm game
     is a little delayed.
    I feel like I'm always
    watching her on Skype.
            Okay.
   Let's try it with music.
      - Oh, my gosh. Okay.
         - Five, six,
      bring it, Trinity.
  - Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
       Mayday, Mayday!
 I may not have it right now,
but I promise I will have it.
         - But people
    have said that before.
- If I can't do it, that means,
  well, girl, I can't dance.
     - Then you might not
     be in the top three.
         - I deserve
      to make top three.
    I've worked my ass off
          for this.
  I've got to figure this out.
   - Shea Coulee, you ready?
       - Mm-hmm. Yeah.
           [laughs]
  - What is this giggle about?
 - You're throwing some real
       shit out today.
          [both laugh]
  - Well, this is Season 9.
    We got to step it up.
    And I'm gonna bring it
      real hard for you
   because I know you dance
        all the time.
          - Mm-hmm.
           - Okay?
         Can you do,
      like, a pirouette?
           -Mm-hmm.
     -A double pirouette?
           -Mm-hmm.
     -A triple pirouette?
        -I could try.
        -Let's see it.
      - Work, bitch, okay.
    - One, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight.
        How'd you do?
        - I did well.
     - She did it. Damn it.
    Shea is gonna continue
     to slay the judges.
         Yay for Shea.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
            - Bitch.
  Like, I'm gonna have to do
     some showgirl shit.
     Throw some pearls down
    so she can, like, fall
      and bust her face.
          -Awesome.
         -All right.
          - Great job.

       - Oh, my goodness.
             Wow!
          [applause]
 - This is the best season of
<i>Dancing with the Stars </i> ever.
          [all laugh]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
   - Ladies, it's time for
  your final four critique.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
        - Category is...
         - Final Four
    Eleganza Extravaganza.
     First up, Peppermint.
        Well, I declare.
   - The first lady of drag.
  - I am giving you ultimate
 18th century luxuriousness.
        I look gorgeous.
     Hell, we can cancel
       the whole thing
  and just give me the crown
          right now.
    - As God is my witness,
      I will never walk
      this runway again.
         Sasha Velour.
      - Crown never felt
          this good.
             - Yes.
       - Well, I think
   she's blooming gorgeous.
             - Yes.
  - This is my pretty in pink,
    but it has a distinct
       Velourian twist.
      There is a crown,
       leather gloves.
   I'm angry and ferocious
        and beautiful
    and everything at once
       that defines me.
         - I own 51%
       of this kingdom.
       [Michelle laughs]
       - Now I'm going
     to wash the dishes.
        Leave me alone.
    - Voulez, Shea Coulee,
          avec moi.
       Bustier, you slay.
     - My look is Balmain
meets Bob Mackie meets Beyonce.
        It's something
      that you would see
   at Madison Square Garden,
    and I don't doubt that
 your girl can make it there.
     - It's like Beyonce
   and a smurf had a baby.
        - Smurf-once.
         [all laugh]
   - Now, I love this look,
  but--and it's a big butt.
          [all laugh]
        Trinity Taylor.
      - Oh, I hate when
  I fall asleep on the bus.
          You know?
         [all laugh]
       - Going through
      this competition,
         I've claimed
    to be a pageant girl,
       and yet to give
  a sickening pageant gown.
      So I am giving them
every ounce of Trinity Taylor
    glamour-puss as I can.
     - Oh, and she's back
      on the chain gang.
         - Yes, she is.
         - Back chains?
          - That way.
   - Welcome, my gorgeous,
       gorgeous girls.
This show is like a GPS system
for many of our young viewers
   as they try to navigate
         their lives,
     which is why I think
      it's so important
   to ask you this question.
             -Aw.
             -Oh.
- Peppermint, you've provided us
   with a childhood photo.
  If you could turn back time,
     what words of wisdom
       would you share
          with your
     four-year-old self?
    - Despite...everything
 you hear from other people,
    everything you feel...
            [sobs]
     everything you feel
   on the inside is right.
      And please...[sobs]
          don't wait.
   Don't wait to express it.
   Don't wait to express it,
      because the moment
      you realize that,
      everyone else will.
     - That's beautiful.
          Thank you.
        Sasha Velour,
this is you at five years old.
      Now, if you could
       turn back time,
what words of wisdom would you
 share with little Alexander?
       - Little Sashinka,
 you think a lot of negative
    things about yourself:
that you are strange-looking,
       too fem, weird.
     And I want to tell you
      that those things
   are all completely true.
          [all laugh]
       And you need to
    stop running from them
 because those are the things
    that make you amazing.
      And one more thing.
    Be good to your mother,
  because there is less time
     than you would want,
        and she deserves
  to see the beautiful queen
        that you are.
  - I'd like to think she's
   watching you right now.
       Thank you, Sasha.
          Shea Coulee.
           - [laughs]
        - This is you
     at three years old.
  What words of wisdom would
 you share with little Jaren?
- Get your head out of the TV
         for a second
  'cause I want to tell you
        you are loved.
  And there are some things
that you are going to experience
       that I wish that
  I could protect you from,
     but those hardships
 make you into the individual
  that's standing here today.
    And I want to thank you.
   Even when I didn't think
that we could do it, you did.
    And I'm so proud of us.
       - Thank you, Shea.
          - Thank you.
       - Trinity Taylor.
          [all laugh]
         This is you
     at eight years old.
  What words of wisdom would
 you share with little Ryan?
      - As you get older,
     things are gonna get
     really bad for you.
           [sniffles]
You're gonna go through a lot
of hardships with your family,
   and people are gonna die
 and they're gonna get sick.
    But you're gonna find
    something very special
   that changes your life,
      and that is drag.
Know that all the things that
 you've been through in life
      are gonna make you
  into a very strong person.
          - Thank you.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - One final question.
   Why should you, and not
  one of your fellow queens,
     be crowned America's
     next drag superstar?
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
   - Ladies, it's time for
  your Final Four critique,
   starting with Peppermint.
- When there are hot young guys
    in harnesses dancing,
       I get distracted.
    Look, a bird, abs, yay.
    But you kept the focus
       the entire time.
 - The lyrics were hilarious,
      were uniquely you.
   You have all the goods,
      and you delivered.
- And I think on this journey,
 as the competition went on,
  I feel like you've become
  more and more of yourself.
  - And thank you for always
   coming out with charisma
    and making us all smile.
- What, she gets no uniqueness,
      nerve and talent?
         - I might be
    spelling a word here.
          [all laugh]
    - Up next, Sasha Velour.
    - We're gonna give you
          uniqueness
           because
    that is what you are.
         And tonight,
   from the start of, like,
      the Vincent Price
      "Thriller" moment
      to your lip synch
      and choreography,
        it was so Sasha.
   - Throughout your journey,
      your runway looks
      have been genius,
   artistic fashion moments.
   You're always innovative.
      - And you managed
    to be consistently you
     and flexible enough
to succeed in this competition.
     I've been impressed
       the entire time.
    - Up next, Shea Coulee.
           - Shea,
   it do take nerve, honey.
    Whether it's Grandrea
  Zuckerwoman or Blac Chyna,
       you always went
     all the way with it,
         and tonight
      was no exception.
      - Your performance
     felt the most cool.
  You really captured what's
happening in music right now.
       - And this look,
   you're kind of giving us
  that, like, Beyonce glamour.
         And you have
      a sense of humor.
           I think
   that's a great package,
      one that's really
        hard to beat.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      - My good, gay gods.
       Trinity, this is
       my favorite look
  you've ever turned tonight.
          - Thank you.
        - And who knew
   that Trinity was funny?
   - The mom in "9021-Ho,"
        it was genius.
   The nun was unbelievable.
      Sister Mary Koont,
         I loved it.
        - Talent, the T,
         that's what
   I'm giving you, Trinity,
 because you have done things
in this competition talent wise
       you didn't know
       you had in you.
        - I'm finally
      figuring this out.
         C-U-N-Trinity.
       - Yes! Thank you.
  - I'd like to buy a vowel,
       Michelle Visage.
   - I told you I had a plan.
          [all laugh]
     - One final question.
    Why should you and not
  one of your fellow queens
     be crowned America's
     next drag superstar?
   Starting with Peppermint.
  - I'd like to take a page
  from our drag foremothers
     way back at Stonewall
     and spread a message
      of love and light.
  I think we have to connect
      with our community
  and people outside of what
we would consider our community.
         As America's
     next drag superstar,
     it will be important
      for me to do that.
          - Thank you.
        - Thank you, Ru.
       - Sasha Velour,
        same question.
     - The future of drag,
   to stand up and carry on
       your legacy, Ru,
      we have to be able
     to do something new.
        The new thing
       is going to seem
       a little strange
     and a little weird,
and the new thing is definitely
 gonna walk in with a scream,
        and that is me.
     - Thank you, Sasha.
         Shea Coulee.
        - I committed.
         I gave 110%.
  And even though I stumbled,
          more than
    any of my competitors,
     I succeeded the most.
      That is the making
       of a superstar.
         I would want
   to carry on your legacy
       and be America's
     next drag superstar.
       - Thank you, Shea.
        Trinity Taylor.
  - Out of every contestant,
     I've grown the most
 not just as an entertainer,
       but as a person.
  I may have had some downs,
   but I've tried so hard,
      through everything
  I've ever done in my life,
   to make something better
         for myself.
   I've never had stability,
          and being
   the next drag superstar
           would be
    a huge weight lifted,
       and I deserve it.
     - Thank you, Trinity.
          - Thank you.
      - Thank you, ladies.
        Now, while you
      untuck backstage,
       the judges and I
       will deliberate.
      [car engine starts]
 All right, now just between
        us four tops,
          let's talk
     about the top four.
             -Mm.
         -Peppermint.
   - Peppermint is a classic.
     She hits her marks.
  She delivers her moments.
  She's a Jane of all trades.
     - She's got that thing
      that is so crucial
for anybody in show business.
   She's got the likeability,
  and if she won the title,
 that's gonna serve her well.
        - Sasha Velour.
       - I'm a huge fan
  because she dissects drag,
    and then reinvents it
in her own very artistic way.
 - Yeah, and we do know what
a Sasha look and act will be.
        - And I liked
     what she had to say
  about the drag of the future
      is not going to be
     what we're used to.
    - I would love to see
    what someone like her
   could do with that crown.
         - Shea Coulee.
  - She's a great entertainer.
    She's a great dancer.
    She's a great actress.
     - And every look was
 pretty great on the runway.
     - With the exception
         of a stumble
   in the makeover challenge,
    she's just been up here.
- She absolutely proved herself
      every single time.
     You should call her
     the postman of drag.
         She delivered.
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - When this first started,
  we just saw pageant girl,
and as this contest progressed,
         so did she.
         - She needed
       these challenges
      to say, no, you're
    actually really funny.
 - And think about how funny
   Stanky the Starfish was.
       - It was amazing.
- And tonight, with her dance,
      she was hilarious.
  - That's my favorite thing
   about this competition,
       when the queens
     surprise themselves.
- I feel like Trinity has made
the biggest leap in my opinion.
    - I'd love to see her
      in the top three.
            - Yeah.
      - Well, this isn't
        gonna be easy.
            Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
        All season long,
        you've worked
  your big ol' booties off,
       and each of you
     has more than earned
   your spot on this stage
           tonight.
     The time has come...
          [thunder]
      for you to lip synch
    [echoing] for your life.
          Good luck
    and don't fuck it up.

     to return next season.
    But for now, sashay away.
    - Oh, that was something.
    - Eureka, Eureka, honey.
         - "Well, shit,
         Biggie is out,
        "but this is not
         the last of me.
         Love, Eureka."
    - Eureka's gone, and I'm
     gonna miss her so much.
She was instantly my best friend
         since day one.
           I am broke.
    - May I just say congrats
to our winner, Miss Shea Coulee.
              -Yes.
             -Yeah.
             - Shea.
   - Shea nailed Black Chyna.
         But the judges
      loved my Kris Jenner.
 Had I nailed my runway harder,
  I would have been the winner.
      - Watching Eureka go
         just reminds us
    that none of us are safe.
            -Uh-huh.
        -That's so true.
     - My ankle was hurting,
 but it magically feels better.
           [all laugh]
      - Nina, do you really
        want to be here?
             - Ooh!
       - Because it feels
         like you don't.
             - How?
    - Every week, when you're
  getting ready in the mirror,
    when we're at rehearsals,
        you're just like,
     I'm over it and I don't
        want to do this.
             -Whoo.
         -First of all,
        I'm getting ready
           over there.
  You're over there, so you're
 not watching me in the mirror.
  - I'm not convinced that Nina
        wants to be here.
   She has this big conspiracy
          that everyone
     wants to see her fail,
     and I'm so tired of it.
        You didn't even--
       - Hold on, hold on.
         La, la, la, la.
         You don't know.
        - I'm not trying
        to come for you--
       - It feels like it.
          Wait, bitch.
          If I'm down,
       I'm down on myself.
    - I know that though Nina
       struggles sometimes
      with her confidence,
    she does want to be here.
        - I just want you
     to believe in yourself
        as much as RuPaul
        believes in you.
       - Right, and put it
       on the line. Right.
  - Because when I was looking
 at her looking into your eyes,
   I wish that she had looked
        at me in my eyes
   the way that she had looked
   at you in yours, you know.
         - I apologize,
     'cause I know right now
    you're kind of just down
        on what happened.
   So I got black real quick.
           [all laugh]
  - Shea's being a really good
    friend to Nina right now,
    but Nina absolutely needs
     an attitude adjustment.
            In fact,
   it's time to trim the fat:
    Nina, for being negative,
    Farrah for not being able
  to stick out from the bunch,
 and Cynthia for not being able
 to do anything except Cynthia.
      If you don't deliver,
       you should go home.

           Hi, ladies.

   - Ladies, the time has come

          -I'm excited.
   I've been waiting for this
       since last season.
             Ha-ha!
            Finally!
      - Imitate a celebrity
   and make us laugh out loud
            or else.
         - Let's do it.
      - What you gonna do,
            Trinity?
        - Amanda Lepore.
              -Aah!
              -Aah!
             - Shea?
      - The face, the body,
         Naomi Campbell.
              -Aha!
              -Oh!
      - What are you doing
       for "Snatch Game?"
         - NeNe Leakes.
             - Yes.
    - She's over everything,
     and she has this really
   bitter face, you know. Mmm.
    - That's like completely
    opposite of you, though.
            - I know.
    That'll be the challenge.
 Impersonations aren't something
   that I've ever tried to do,
    but last week, I was able
     to take Britney Spears
           and turn it
      into something great.
       So if I can do that
      with my NeNe Leakes,
       then it's all good.

       Nina Bo'nina Brown
          Nelson Riley.
          - Hey, Rrrru.
      How you doing, baby?
      - How are you doing?
          - I am doing
        a lot better now.
    - Because, listen, child,
        you know, I know
      from where you come.
 It's an ongoing struggle where
 you have to shut up that voice.
       - That voice, yeah.
     It's so easy to attach
       onto the negative.
        I don't know why.
         And the people
      are starting to think
  that I'm playing this victim
   thing, but, no, it's real.
        -It's not an act.
         -That's right.
      - And the only person
   who will lose at it is you.
      But you're talented.
        All of the things
        you come up with,
     that's some real shit.
    That's what got you here.
     - Right. I have so much
     for respect for RuPaul
   'cause I really do not know
    what to do with my life.
        I'm 34 years old,
       I'm still at home,
     and he believes in me.
    So I do not want to make
    that man not proud of me.
     - So who are you doing?
         - [deep voice]
      I am Jasmine Masters
   and I got something to say.
   - Oh, oh, that's brilliant.
        That's hilarious.
         - Do you buy it
         or you rent it?
       - I'm rent to own.
          - Okay, girl.
         - She's funny.
     I love Jasmine Masters.
      You better bring it,
  because we don't want to see
     your dark nemesis come
 and tapping you on the shoulder
 and irk you in the side, okay?
           All right.
       See you out there.
           Hi, Sasha.
          - Hi, RuPaul.
        -I see a top hat.
            -Mm-hmm.
        -A men's jacket.
            -Mm-hmm.
       - I'm gonna go with
        Marlene Dietrich?
    -You got it on the nose.
          -Oh, really?
   Now, Germans aren't really
     known for being funny.
     How are you gonna make
     Marlene Dietrich funny?
    - Honestly, I don't think
 I'm known for being very funny.
           - What were
       your other choices?
       - I had considered
         Judith Butler,
         the third wave
      feminist philosopher.
  - Can you do a little bit of
 Judith Butler right now for me?
      - Sure, let's do it.
      - Now, Judith Butler,
   should I have the meatloaf
   or the hot dog at the diner
        down the street?
       - I'm understanding
      that in this example,
   hot dog actually stands in
 as a kind of social construct,
    a metaphor, if you will,
      for the idea of a man
         sort of center
     of his phallic primacy.
     - I'm glad you're doing
        Marlene Dietrich.
  - [laughs] I'm a very serious
       and intense person.
      But I do crack jokes
         in my own way.
     - Can't wait to see you
           out there.
         - So I'm hoping
     I can tap into that...
             charm.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      Mama, it's come true!
          - Damn, girl.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
           - It's time
      for a "Snatch Game."
      You have to be funny,
         you have to be
       quick on your feet,
          and you have
        to make Ru laugh.
    - Well, Alexis Michelle.
          - Hi, RuPaul.
          - Now, okay,
        I'm gonna guess.
       Is it Joyce DeWitt?
    - It's not Joyce DeWitt.
           It's Liza!
            [laughs]
            -Finally.
            -Finally.
     - Mama, it's come true!
          [both laugh]
    So how are you gonna make
     this Liza come to life?
             Because
    a lot of people do Liza.
              -Yes.
  -A lot of eyes will be on you
   to do all the right moves.
    - She's one of my biggest
       drag inspirations,
         so I want this
    to be done with respect.
    This is a loving tribute.
       - Well, that's all
         well and nice,
         but, you know,
   you got to make her funny.
             - Yes.
       I have to make sure
   that I am bringing it hard.
     I have to let them see
           [whispers]
        that I'm a star.
             - Well,
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
        I see a tank top
     and a brown lace front.
          Are you doing
         Sofia Vergara?
             - Yes!
   - That's a great character
            for you.
     - Thank you. I've been
     studying Sofia Vergara
      for almost two years.
   I think it's a good choice
     because we have accent.
       I'm gonna slay her.
 - Can you give me just a touch
        of Sofia Vergara?
      - [speaking Spanish]
         Why you ask me
    that question right now?
      I need more<i> fornido.</i>
      Do you have<i> fornido?</i>
        I can't give you
    all this count right now.
     - Okay, so when are you
   going to start doing Sofia?
              - Oh.
             - Ooh.
           Damn, girl.
            - I think
  it's going to be interesting
          to watch you
     make her come to life.
          - Thank you.
     Thank you, Mama RuPaul.
     - All right, bye, Cucu.
       All right, ladies,
          gather round.
Now, in a few moments, you'll be
     shooting "Snatch Game."
   And tomorrow on the runway,
       the category is...
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas,
           Part Deux.
      [cheers and applause]
             - Whoo!
     We get to actually redo
       the Madonna runway
      that was an epic fail
          last season.
         Sorry, ladies.
      - One word of advice.
    Kimono she better don't.
     [laughter and applause]
    - Thank you, Mama RuPaul.
   - Welcome to "Snatch Game."
   Let's meet our contestants.
    He once got a standing O
      from Elaine Stritch.
       It's Denis O'Hare.
       Our next contestant
     is allergic to mustard.
        Keep that hot dog
       away from my face.
   Say hello to Candis Cayne.
          Are you ready
      to snatch the stars?
              -Yes.
           -Let's go.
       - Good. Let's give
     a big game show welcome
      to downtown superstar
         Amanda Lepore.
         - Hi, everyone.
       - Oh, my goodness.
     You are such a gorgeous
      international vixen.
        How do you do it?
   - These lips have secrets.
        - I bet they do.
     Next up, the legendary
    Marlene Dietrich is here.
       - Thank you so much
     for having me, RuPaul,
       on your<i> Drag Race.</i>
        I see you're also
         wearing a suit.
      -I'm wearing a suit.
 -You know, when I wear a suit,
      people say, Marlene,
       are you a lesbian?
       And I look at them
         and I say, yes.
           [laughing]
   - All right. We've got some
     <i> Drag</i> Race alumni here.
     Alyssa Edwards is here.
   -For your consideration...
            -Uh-huh.
   - My name is Alyssa Edwards
   and this is "Snatch Game."
     - Up next, pop the corn
     and feed the children.
      It's Jasmine Masters,
         another alumni.
    -[deep voice] Hey, bitch.
            -[laughs]
      What brings you back
          to<i> Drag Race?</i>
    -I got something to say.
         -I bet you do.
   Next up, Internet superstar
     Gigi Gorgeous is here.
            -Hi, Ru.
           -Hi, doll.
       You look fantastic.
     Hey, I could really use
  a makeup tip right about now.
     - You know what I say.
       You can never wear
      too much highlighter.
           - Ooh, yes.
         Ring dem bells.
       It's Liza Minnelli
      or is it Lisa Manuli?
            - No, Ru,
       it's Liza with a Z.
           It has a Z.
        - Liza with a Z.
           - With a Z!
      -Yes, Liza with a Z.
           -Yes, yeah.
          - All right.
            Up next,
       we've got Atlanta's
         juiciest peach,
      NeNe Leakes is here.
            - Hi, Ru.
     - How are you and Kenya
             doing?
     - Ru, mm, that bitch--
            - Uh-oh.
         - If her weave
      was on any tighter...
      - What would happen?
     Would her head pop off?
           - Her head
      would explode, bitch.
          - Oh, bloop.
            - Bloop!
             - Okay.
            Next up,
      she was Miss Universe
    for just about a minute.
   Say hello to Miss Colombia.
     Oh, I didn't mean to--
          did I--what?
    - Is that Steve Harvey?!
            - No, no,
      I'm not Steve Harvey.
      No, no, no, darling.
          It's RuPaul.
             I know.
     We just all look alike.
             - Aah!
           - Up next,
     supermodel of the world
         Naomi Campbell
       is up in the house.
         You don't look
         a day over 16.
       - And I don't taste
         a day over 15.
            -[laughs]
              -Yes.
          - All right.
      From "Modern Family,"
         Sofia Vergara.
     - Hola. How you doin',
             RuPaul?
     - How is your husband,
       Joe Mangananganan?
    - You know what, RuPaul?
     You don't have to worry
  about mention that last name,
             because
     I always have problem.
    The only thing is, like,
    when we have a little bit
         of interaction
    or maybe probably sex...
             - Yeah.
    - We don't have to talk.
            It's just
       only body language.
        - Body language,
          darling, yes.
      - And let me tell you
           something.
    These too big, beautiful
   Colombian surgical raisins
     is making happy and hoo
      all the entire night
         trying to look
      for another children.
        - Well, you know,
         she's smiling,
            so I know
      she just told a joke.
     All right. Who's ready
     to play "Snatch Game?"
        - You better make
      Mama Ru laugh, girl,
      'cause if she's not,
  you might be sashaying away.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      - If it's not on BET,
    I don't know what it is.
     - I never win anything!
           [all laugh]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
         - Welcome back
        to "Snatch Game."
        Okay, here we go.
         First question
      is for Denis O'Hare.
             The new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
         It takes place
     in Lady Bunny's blank.
      All right, pens down.
       Okay, Denis O'Hare.
        - It takes place
           in her wig.
     - In Lady Bunny's wig.
      That's a good answer.
  Let's go to the stars and see
  if you get any matches, okay?
       - Oh, I feel good.
        - Liza Minnelli.
            - I said
      Lady Bunny's palace.
          - Her palace?
    - Because there's nothing
    like playing the Palace.
           [all laugh]
     Mama played the Palace
            and I sat
    right in the fourth row.
              -Wow.
     -She sang right to me.
      And to all the other
          homosexuals.
           [all laugh]
 - All right, let's move on down
  to superstar Alyssa Edwards.
          What say you?
        - I wrote snatch.
        - In her snatch.
     Not a match for Denis.
          - Did I lose
        the Q&A portion?
        - No, you didn't.
            [laughs]
   All right, Jasmine Masters.
             The new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
       It all takes place
       in Lady Bunny's...
         - American who?
       If it's not on BET,
    I don't know what it is.
           [all laugh]
    - So if it's not on BET,
       you don't watch it?
        - Hell to the no.
         - Oh. [laughs]
     Amanda Lepore, the new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
       It all takes place
       in Lady Bunny's...
    - Plastic surgery office.
           She clearly
      isn't going to mine.
   - Oh, my God. Can you move
        your face at all?
   - I'm moving it right now.
           - [laughs]
     - So let's move on down
       to Naomi Campbell.
   I see you have a cell phone
          right there.
    - When I got here to set,
            your crew
      confiscated my phone,
          but luckily,
    my good friend back here
      had a little prepaid
          Cricket phone
     that she let me borrow
       for the afternoon.
           Chris Rock,
        thank you so much
      for letting me borrow
           your phone.
           - Oh, dang!
        - I thought about
  Tyra Bank's modeling career,
   so I just said the toilet.
           - [laughs]
    All right. Gigi Gorgeous,
        what do you have?
         - I think that
    it's gonna be her fridge.
  I highly doubt that she eats
   organic, gluten-free food,
           and I would
        just be terrified
           to open up
      the refrigerator, Ru.
       - It's not a match.
  Now, Candis, you're up next.
         - Okay, hit it.
       - I just found out
         my cat is gay.
      Last night, he didn't
      cough up a fur ball.
     He coughed up a blank.
      Pens down, everybody.
       Okay, Candis Cayne.
       - My cat is so gay,
   a purse fell out his mouth.
   - That is one gay pussycat.
              Okay.
        Marlene Dietrich?
   - As a point of principle,
     I make sure that every
  homosexual pussy that I meet
       receives a Marlene
       signed photograph.
     - Not a match, Candis,
           I'm afraid.
       - I'd love to give
      Fraulein Candis Cayne
      a signed photograph.
            I promise
     that Teutonic bisexuals
     make the most forceful
    and unforgettable lovers.
           [all laugh]
 - All right. Let's move on down
        to Ms. Colombia--
  Well, actually, Ms. Colombia,
    did you write an answer?
   - I can never win anything.
           - [laughs]
            -[cries]
  -She's not gonna get very far
        in this business
         like that, Ru.
           [all laugh]
      - Gigi Gorgeous, what
    did you write down, girl?
  - He coughed up an Anastasia
    Beverly Hills lip gloss.
           - Oh, okay.
       Well, not a match,
         unfortunately.
        Jasmine Masters.
      Jasmine, what season
     were you on<i> Drag Race?</i>
        - Does it matter?
           Did I win?
           - [laughs]
       All right, Jasmine.
       Do you have a match
           for Candis?
      - I don't own a cat.
        They sense evil.
         - Oh. [laughs]
  All right, this is a question
        for Denis O'Hare.
        Snapchat filters
    are getting so inventive.
 Now instead of swapping faces,
       you can swap blank.
      - You can swap wives.
          - Swap wives!
         Sofia Vergara,
          what say you?
        - You know what?
  I think it's related to what
    are you looking to swap.
    So maybe I said titties.
  They help me to be successful
 in this entertainment business.
      It's part of the why,
            you know.
  - Girl, where are the jokes?
      Where are the jokes?
         Sofia is funny.
           [whispers]
      Where are the jokes?
           - Let's go
      to Marlene Dietrich.
  - Well, I found this question
         kind of unfair
      because, as you know,
 I rarely know these new things.
    I rarely leave my house.
              - No.
          - And I died
        many decades ago.
    - You did. This is going
  somewhere, I can tell, yeah.
 - So I wrote (speaking German)
         and sauerkraut.
      - That's not a match,
  but a very, very good answer
      and a long way to go
         for an answer.
           I love it.
     All right, let's rewind
        down to the ATL.
  NeNe Leakes is in the house.
   Instead of swapping faces,
       you can swap what?
   - If I was gonna do an app
     or some kind of filter
          on Snapchat,
    I would definitely do one
         for poor people
      like Jasmine Masters.
     Now, if Jasmine Masters
 were gonna have a filter on her
   discontinued Cricket phone,
     she would probably have
  to swap credit scores first.
        - Credit scores.
            - Bloop.
      - Not a match, Denis.
    You're looking for wives.
          - I've known
      a couple of husbands.
             - Yeah.
    All right, Liza with a Z.
        - Ru, I said that
    you can swap jazz hands.
        - Can you show us
        your jazz hands?
           [all laugh]
    All right, Ms. Colombia,
        what do you have?
  - In my country, we are known
       for beautiful woman
    and I think also cocaina.
       - Cocaine, cocaina.
   - I think now I understand,
            hermana,
    why you lost the pageant.
     This is not the shadow
        I know, you know,
   because I love her so much,
          ay dios mio!
             - Oh...
            Cynthia.
 Girl, I'm sure Eureka is pissed
      somewhere right now.
       She gonna be, like,
      I went home for this?
    - Well, that's our show.
      And the winner is...
    all the celebrities that
  weren't impersonated tonight.
     Good night, everybody.
            [laughs]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
          - Category is
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas.
             Uh-oh.
     - How does that happen?
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
    - It is elimination day,
  and we all have to get ready
          for the Night
       of 1,000 Madonnas,
         the redemption.
    - I don't know about you,
         but personally,
         I like to have
        a big separation
    between Trinity and Ryan.
          And it's not
        necessarily like,
        oh, I don't want
     to be feminine or any--
   'cause I'm a feminine guy.
    - I just don't understand
       society's obsession
           with trying
       to label something.
        I just feel like
         gender's over.
       It's so fluid now.
         It was actually
         through my drag
         that I realized
         my trans-ness.
           - Oh, wow.
         So you identify
        as trans, Pepper?
      - I am a--I'm trans.
        I'm a transwoman.
     There's a lot of people
   who think that drag queens
 are not trans and shouldn't be.
           And there's
      a lot of trans people
 who think that drag queens have
no place in the trans community.
       I wanted to really
      get to know the girls
   before I came out to them.
          I was afraid.
     It took me a long time
   to really sort out gender.
   And at a really early age,
           I was able
      to latch on to drag,
   and that was how I was able
    to express my femininity.
             - Yeah.
     - But I kind of evolved
           to realize
    that all the drag things
      that I wanted to do,
       it always led back
       to the realization
     that I'm a transwoman.
      - That is courageous.
         - Yes, Pepper.
       - Thank you so much
        for saying that.
     - I love that so much.
     Peppermint is giving us
    her true, authentic self,
     and it's just wonderful
         and I love her
      and I look up to her
            so much.
      - I just want to say
        thank you so much
  for the support and the love
        and the affection
   that you guys have shown me
        just in general.
     And I just really want
     to thank you for that.
             - Oh...
         - We love you.
       - Come on, Pepper.
       - It feels so good
      to be fully accepted.
     I'm so happy right now.
          I'm so happy.

           - And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
     of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
       My favorite Madonna
 impersonator, Michelle Visage.
    - I'm looking for Susan.
       Have you seen her?
        - I'm desperately
          seeking her.
           - Me, too.
        - Style superstar
        Carson Kressley.
            - Hello.
       - Your Ross Mathews
    impersonation is spot on.
  - I crawled real deep inside
   Ross Mathews to play this.
          [both laugh]
   - "American Horror Story's"
          Denis O'Hare.
      Now, when you played
    Liz Taylor, did you tuck?
      -Tucking is barbaric.
              -Oh.
          No, darling.
     Untucking is barbaric.
           [all laugh]
      And the scintillating
          Candis Cayne.
   Now, what star would you do
       for "Snatch Game?"
        - I have no idea.
   - Let me guess, Judge Judy?
             - Yes.
           [all laugh]
          - This week,
    we challenged our queens
     to snatch our attention
          and tonight,
          category is,
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas,
          the She-quel.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines.
   And may the best woman win.
         Category is...
        Aja, last night,
     she dreamt of San Pedro
          or Del Taco,
      if I'm not mistaken.
     - I'm just showing off
       my little ruffles.
I feel like I should've came out
      with some castanets.
            [laughs]
       - La is La Boniba.
         Alexis Michelle
     as Breathless Mahoney.
            More like
       breathless my hand.
           [all laugh]
       - I love my shape.
       I love the sequin.
         I'm breathless.
     - Has anyone seen Dick?
              -Who?
             -Tracy.
      - Oh, my bottom hurts
     just thinking about it.
     Peppermint. Experience
   has made her a rich bitch.
   - Trying to buy our votes.
       - This is probably
   my favorite Madonna video.
    This gorgeous woman being
  surrounded by all these guys.
         It's my dream.
  - Talk to me, Harry Winston.
   Shea Coulee, Material Girl.
            Déjà vu.
            - I think
      she stole that look.
   - This is the second wife,
 the one that gets all the money
 and the diamonds and the furs.
            You know,
       all the good goods.
          - Drag queens
    really do prefer blondes.
         Trinity Taylor.
              -Ooh.
      -Givenchy better do.
        [Michelle laughs]
          - My Madonna
      is the only Madonna.
   I feel like a very strong,
    powerful bitch right now.
        - It's a pantsuit
       without the pants.
        - Who needs pants
   when you have all this ass?
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Louise Ciccone.
            - I think
    I've met this one before.
      -Who wore it better?
      -Hmm, we'll find out.
  - Right now, I'm just trying
    to serve a black version
           of Madonna,
       even though they'd
     just seen this outfit.
   - Don't get mad, get plaid.
          Sasha Velour.
              - Oh.
       - Her name is Dita
 and she will be your mistress.
          - Nice grill.
       - This is very much
    the type of Madonna look
        that inspired me
          and my style.
     And I'm really excited
             to show
         that I can walk
      like a fashion model.
        - Put your hands
       all over her body.
           [all laugh]
     Farrah Moan, Cleopatra.
             - Wow.
    - My Madonna is probably
       the best one here.
    Every detail is on point.
  - Well, this Super Bowl look
          is a homerun.
           [all laugh]
          - Aren't you
        mixing metaphors?
   - Do you mean a touchdown?
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
              -Oh!
             -Uh-oh.
           - [laughs]
             - Ole.
        - Mata-adorable.
   - Nobody's wearing my look?
              Whoo!
       [speaking Spanish]
  - I think she lost her bull.
          - Valentina.
              -Oh.
              -Hmm.
           - You know,
       I hate censorship.
           - Me, too.
     - When Madonna came out
         with this look,
    it was so controversial.
And showing this much of my body
     is controversial, too.
         - I'll walk out
      the way I walked in.
             Naked.
           [all laugh]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
           -Slam dunk.
             -Brava.
     - Uh, no, not so good.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
   - Ladies with an attitude,
    I've made some decisions.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
         Trinity Taylor.
              Aja.
           Valentina.
          Shea Coulee.
       Ladies, this week,
 you did not cause a commotion.
          You're safe.
    You may leave the stage.
            It's time
    for the judges critiques,
          starting with
        Alexis Michelle.
   - You do such a good Liza,
   she better watch her back.
 - Even the way your breathed in
    after you spoke was Liza.
           - [inhales]
          - That's what
       I'm talking about.
        - And that dress
         is painted on.
       You look gorgeous.
   - I feel momentum with you.
           Keep it up.
     - Next up, Peppermint.
  - This is one of my favorite
         Madonna looks,
           and I think
       you look beautiful.
   - But three weeks in a row
         we've had pink,
     so I am looking forward
        to another color.
      Okay, so NeNe Leakes.
    She is larger than life,
    but I felt like you were
   just being a regular girl.
        - Credit scores.
     - She serves attitude.
     She serves one-liners.
       You could have gone
       anywhere with her.
       But it just doesn't
     cross the finish line.
         - Sasha Velour.
      - Erotica, slam dunk.
        I'm loving seeing
     this other side of you.
            - I love
     the big circle nipples.
          I can't stop
        looking at them.
          I don't know
        what that means.
      And in "Snatch Game,"
             for me,
    it was like Jessica Lange
         in "Freakshow"
     meets "Touch of Evil."
        I thought it was
       just extraordinary.
             Brava.
         - Farrah Moan.
   - This look is so gorgeous,
           and you did
    such a great job with it.
         - I love Gigi.
          I know Gigi.
         And I feel like
    you could have pushed it,
      made it more comedic.
        - I thought maybe
         you were gonna
throw a bunch of makeup products
       over your shoulder.
             I think
     you only did that once.
       - For some reason,
       I thought there was
     gonna be more questions
   and I'd have opportunities
           to do more.
       - See, that's what
       young people think.
      You see, when you get
     to be my age, you know,
   you get one chance, sonny,
        and you take it.
   Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Bader Ginsberg.
           [all laugh]
  - I so would have loved this
    if I didn't see Trinity's
      version of this look.
           You get it.
    It's just a heightened...
  -Yeah, it was more tailored.
            -Exactly.
          - But I loved
      your Jasmine Masters.
     The voice was spot on.
        - Hell to the no.
          - You played
       by your own rules.
        You didn't answer
          the questions
     the way they were meant
         to be answered.
    You answered them the way
   you wanted to answer them.
   I thought that was really,
          really cool.
          - Thank you.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
             - Hola!
            - I love
    good boy-drag-drag-girl.
          - Thank you.
   - But something's going on
     with your makeup, mija.
      I see too much brown
            going on.
     It's almost a mustache.
       - I love the choice
    of Sofia Vergara for you,
     but I didn't understand
       what was going on.
    And it wasn't the accent.
    - I literally don't think
   there was one joke in that.
           And you had
       a regular dress on.
     Sofia Vergara has tits
   that are bigger than mine.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   I think we've heard enough.
    While you take a holiday,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
        Now, just between
     us material squirrels,
       what do you think?
        Let's start with
        Alexis Michelle.
    - Last week was the mall.
     This week was couture.
 - And in "Snatch Game," she was
 witty, but in character witty.
      She wasn't making fun
        of the character.
          She was being
         the character.
      For me, it's a tossup
           between her
      and Marlene Dietrich.
       - But her Liza was
    the best characterization
and the thing that I'll remember
    about this "Snatch Game"
    more than anything else.
          - Peppermint.
    - Tonight on the runway,
    I felt like it was, like,
          more Marilyn
      than it was Madonna.
        And her character
      in the "Snatch Game"
             for me
      was one of the worst.
    If she didn't say bloop,
      I wouldn't have known
       it was NeNe Leakes.
         - In fairness,
       I said bloop first,
      and then she said it.
   - But it happens to people
       when they're acting
           sometimes.
     They get in their head.
      - But I'm not getting
  what I know she can deliver.
         - Sasha Velour.
     - Tonight on the runway
        was a 10 for me.
  - And even with the whip, it
made a link to Marlene Dietrich.
      - Yes, that's right.
        - It is not easy
   to deliver Marlene Dietrich
   and have it be interesting
     to this time and place.
    - What I love about Sasha
      is she knows her lane
   and she never lets me down.
         Sasha's got me.
         - Farrah Moan.
       - I just feel like
     she knew who Gigi was,
       but didn't know how
      to get anything more
      than "hi" out of her.
      - I think she thought
 that by choosing Gigi Gorgeous,
    it would gain her points
         in the sort of
    underground cool factor,
         which it does.
             - Yes.
    - But it didn't give her
   enough options as a player.
       - Isn't it ironic,
  the cool ones ended up being
        Marlene Dietrich
       and Liza Minnelli,
          and the kids
        don't even know.
             -Right.
 -But I thought her Madonna look
  was maybe the most intricate
         of everybody's.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown.
  - We've been waiting for her
   to stop with the boo-hooing
         and step it up,
           and I think
       as Jasmine Masters,
    it was a big step forward
        for Nina Bo'nina.
   - Denis, a little backstory
       for you and Candis.
         Nina comes from
     the Atlanta drag scene,
         who have never
      really accepted her.
      So when she got here,
     she felt some kind of a
 conspiracy theory against her.
 - I think it's kind of amazing
         in a meta theme
 that she chose Jasmine Masters
   to express her discontent.
              -Yes.
    -Because Jasmine Masters
       is the poster child
         for discontent.
            -[laughs]
      -But that being said,
     I saw a very confident,
    fully realized character.
      - But on the runway,
      uh, no, not so good.
            - Uh-oh.
     - One thing I will say
          as a sidebar,
 I don't like when these queens
        do other queens.
             - Yeah.
       - Like, I feel like
     it's an easy way to go.
      - I'm with Michelle.
        I feel like when
   you're doing "Snatch Game,"
      it's somebody that's
     beyond your knowledge.
       - Okay. We've come
 to that portion in our program
   where we have to talk about
    the elephant in the room.
      - Oh, I'm on a diet.
           [all laugh]
           - Not you.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine
        as Sofia Vergara.
       - It was this mess,
   this just nonsensical mess.
- And she's got a Spanish accent
    and it didn't even work.
      How does that happen?
    - Perhaps she's too close
        to the character.
      If she went somewhere
      very, very different,
       she might have had
        a better effect.
      - Think of Yara Sofia
        as Amy Winehouse.
              -Yes.
          -We all died.
      - Exactly. She should
    have played Maggie Smith.
           [all laugh]
     - It's not good enough.
     She got a second chance
          to come back.
   She should be twice as good
    as the rest of the girls.
       - All right, kids.
            Silence.
           Bring back
      my Madonna wannabes.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Sasha Velour.
      Your Marlene Dietrich
       was a ray of light.
        Alexis Michelle.
       Your Liza Minnelli
       left us breathless.
        Alexis Michelle,
       con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
      You've won a dazzling
      $2,000 prize package
   from Sparkles rhinestones.
      - Thank you so much.
           [all laugh]
   - Sasha Velour, great job.
    You're safe. You may join
        the other girls.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
          you're safe.
    - [deep voice] Thank you.
           [all laugh]
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   The judges were not bullish
     on your Sofia Vergara.
   I'm sorry, my dear, but you
     are up for elimination.
     - I feel very confused
   because I wasn't expecting
          to be, like,
      second week in a row
         in the bottom.
     - Peppermint, your NeNe
          was a no-no.
   You needed better material,
              girl.
          Farrah Moan.
     Your Gigi was gorgeous,
      but your comic timing
         wasn't pretty.
         Farrah Moan...
          you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
           Peppermint,
       I'm sorry, my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
- I'm about to do the thing that
   I know how to do the best.
      Actually, I'm worried
          for Cynthia.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.

           - [laughs]
       - I'm not defeated,
      and I just appreciate
    that Mama RuPaul give me
  this opportunity back again.
    There's going to be a lot
     of cucu in the future.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine

              -No!
             -Bloop!
           - Titties.
  They help me to be successful
 in this entertainment business.
          - Peppermint.
    - NeNe Leakes, you could
  have gone anywhere with her,
       but it just doesn't
     cross the finish line.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
       - I love the choice
    of Sofia Vergara for you,
     but I didn't understand
       what was going on.
    And it wasn't the accent.
       - Alexis Michelle.
   - You do such a good Liza,
   she better watch her back.
      - Con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
          - Peppermint,
       shantay, you stay.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
          sashay away.
         - Oh, my gosh,
        this is so tight.
      - I think Peppermint
       is a little shaken
           after being
       in the bottom two.
    But that lip sync, girl,
     she did the damn thing.
 I think we got a real lip sync
     assassin on our hands.
- I'm just so happy that Cynthia
      had a second chance.
           She brought
      so much love and joy.
          - I love her,
        but, bye, bitch!
  - Trinity is the new official
    messy queen of Season 9.
           - No, I am
     the new official cucu.
              -Oh!
             -Whoo!
              -Hey!
              -Yes.
      - Cynthia went home,
       and unfortunately,
     that's how this cookie
        is gonna crumble
       for a lot of girls.
     There can only be one,
     and some of these girls
           got to go.
         Congratulations
         to you, though.
          I'm so happy
     that you actually won.
           - Ross said
      that I am rising up.
   It felt really good to get
  some really strong critiques.
        Thank you, Ross.
   I will take that to heart.
        - Alexis Michelle
    finally won a challenge.
     Girl, watch out 'cause
     she is going to make it
     <i> ♪ me, me, me, me, me ♪</i>
     She's going to make it
        the Alexis show.
          - I feel good
        about what I did,
    and hopefully from now on
     I can just kind of like
        have a little fun
      and let down my guard
          a little bit.
             -Good.
       -No, not hopefully.
    From now on, you're gonna
       let down your guard
       and have more fun.
          Right, girl?
          - Okay, mom.
  Thank y'all for all y'all's,
            you know,
     support and reading me
         behind my back.
       - Girl, we read you
       to your face, too.
 From now on, we ain't gonna be
 giving you no more compliments
      'cause now you's some
    real competition, bitch.
 -So let's get out of this drag.
   -Well, on that note, bitch.
            - [sighs]
      - You guys, who am I?
         - [whiny voice]
      I need to smoke, why?
    You can never wear enough
          highlighter.
              Oh...
        - The competition
    is getting a lot tighter.
        I feel like I am
      a strong competitor.
    But there are some other
   really strong competitors.
         <i> - ♪ Ka-ka-ka,</i>

               Ow!
            Aah! God.
       - You got to do it
        like a Band-Aid.
         It's not a time
       to get comfortable.
     - That was so painful.
        Thank you, babe.

           [all laugh]
         For this week's
         maxi challenge,
       you'll be acting in
   a classic high school drama
       that we're calling
            <i> 9021-Ho.</i>
           [all laugh]
    And you can hashtag that.
             #9021HO
          Later today,
   you'll head over to the set
   to meet your co-directors,
        from the original
      <i> Beverly Hills 90210,</i>
   the legendary Jennie Garth
       and Tori Spelling.
           [cheering]
       - My mind is blown.
   - Peppermint, you survived
      last week's lip sync,
      so you get to assign
           the roles.
   It's back to class, ladies,
      but this time, you're
    going to rule the school.
          So good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.
  - Oh, my God, this is great.
             - Wow.
      -<i> 90210</i> was the show
    that I would, like, sneak
into my brother's room to watch.
      This is my childhood
           right here.
     I'm an expert on<i> 90210,</i>
     so I feel really ready
       for this challenge.
          - All right,
      let's go through it.
     Blenda Schmaltz, she's
 the original high school bitch.
    Monna Dartin, good girl.
         She's a virgin.
          Then there's
      Grandrea Zuckerwoman,
     the high school senior
     who looks 50 years old.
       Ooh, she's pregnant
    and doesn't know it. Wow.
          - Do you have
        any inclinations?
          - My approach
       is to ask the girls
   what roles they want to do,
             because
    I don't want to be blamed
   if somebody doesn't do well
       in this challenge.
    I want to know if there's
anything that speaks to anybody.
     - My first two choices
     are Mirror Monna Dartin
  or Bethani Glamber Gliessen.
      - I was kind of into,
          like, Blenda.
        - I kind of like
          all of them,
   but, like, my favorites are
  Mirror Monna Dartin or Blenda
      because they're both
        bitchy and nasty.
             - Okay.
     So, ladies, I have cast
         the production.
   The role of Blenda Schmaltz
         will be played
     by Nina Bo'nina Brown.
             - Word.
       Thank you, Pepper.
            - Bethani
     will be played by Shea.
             - Yes.
     - Grandrea Zuckerwoman
     will be played by Aja.
  - That was none of my picks.
         - I know that.
          [sighs] God.
     - Don't roll your eyes.
 - Don't get in your head, girl.
      - It's gonna be good.
     - It's just frustrating
        because I always
           land a role
       that I don't want.
  - Let's just make this work.
           - Can I go
        on a smoke break?
  - Are you that stressed out?
      - Yeah, I don't want
         to be Grandrea.
    - Girl, you gotta grow up
    and accept the challenge.
       - I don't have to.
            - [sighs]
          If it's going
        to be that tense,
       I'll take Grandrea
          and she can--
     - No, you don't have to
because it's not your detriment.
      - What I'm saying is,
           I can do--
        - You know what?
     I'm making a decision.
   You two are swapping roles.
    - I don't want to be a--
    - You're swapping roles.
            - I know,
     but I'm not trying to--
       - You already said
        you're stressed.
      I know how you feel.
        But now what role
          do you have?
            -Bethani.
    -Are you cool with that?
     - Yeah, I'm cool with--
   like, I don't mean trouble.
  - It's just we got a lot to--
        - Let's rehearse.
      - I think Aja doesn't
     want to play a grandma.
  It's one of the biggest parts
          in the show,
      and you traded it in
     for a bitch who's only
       in the last scene.
  So now you look like a bitch
         playing a bitch
       in the last scene.
      - I feel so childish
           right now.
  - Well, you probably should,
              girl.

   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - I'm the new bitch
         in this school.
    - Who wants my virginity?
       - Mom, what are you
           doing here?
   This week's maxi challenge
      is to act in the new
       TV classic<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
      - We need to, like--
    we need to run off like--
         like run, like,
       flipping our hair.
   - Me and Trinity are going
     to add a little quirks
   and kirks--is that a word?
           Qui--quirk.
  We're adding little quirks--
   Are you sure that's a word?
             Quirks.
   Anyways, we're doing these
     little things together,
 and I think it's going to read
     really well on camera.
     - She didn't wear it up
     on her head like that.
        - But that's very
         nineties to me.
 - Um, can I make a suggestion?
       - Yeah, what's up?
   - 'Cause you say your name,
             right?
        - Yeah, Grandrea.
    - Say it--yeah, Grandrea,
        so that it sounds
          like Andrea.
    - Okay, girl, we get it.
   You watched the show a lot.
  - They definitely had, like,
      more natural eyebrows
        in the nineties.
     So, like, not too thin
     or not too sculptural.
          - Girl, bye.
             <i> Fuera.</i>
       - It's time for us
        to shoot<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
     I'm looking to toe up,
       but I'm loving it,
      and I'm ready to go.
        - Hello, ladies.
    I'm Jennie and I will be
      your director today.
        - Excuse me, hi.
            I'm Tori.
  Actually, I'm your director.
      - You know what, Tor?
   It's not always about you,
              okay?
    - Well, of course, it is.
    - Hmm. I've been wanting
     to do this a long time.
            - [gasps]
              - Oh!
           And scene.
           [all laugh]
         - Now, ladies,
  that's what you call acting.
         - Let's see it.
       Places, everybody.
            - And...
            -Action.
            -Action.
            - Uh, uh,
    I'm Grandrea Zuckerwoman
      and I'm a... [coughs]
        I'm a... [coughs]
          I'm a senior.
        - A senior what?
      - [laughs and snorts]
           - And cut.
       - Shea, your cough
        and snort combo--
    really, really something.
       - Well, thank you.
    I'm a terrible asthmatic.
            [laughs]
        - Let's move on.
   - Maybe at this new school,
 you shouldn't be such a bitch.
   - Where are the cool people
        at in the school?
              -Cut.
       -Nina, maybe try it
           with, like,
        a different tone.
 - Where are the cool people at?
          This school.
              - No.
      Maybe lose the pause
          before "at."
   - Where are the cool people
         at this school?
           - Where are
       the cool people at?
   - Where are the cool people
         in this school?
  - Our milkshakes are melting
       because Nina keeps
      messing up her lines,
     and it's taking forever
     for them to get to us.
     - The girl-to-boy ratio
           here blows.
    - Nina, I would recommend
       maybe articulating
 a little bit more on that line.
     - The girl-to-boy ratio
             blows.
    - Nina speaks super fast.
       La-la-la-la-la-la.
          - Hey, Nina.
    - The girl-to-boy ratio.
   Just make sure that we can
  really understand your words.
        -Time to move on.
            -Action.
            - [gasps]
       Oh, my God, Marta--
            [laughs]
        - Did you forget
          who you were?
      -Yeah. I got it now.
             -Okay.
         - Marna Donny--
  Sorry. Can I start that over?
             - Cut.
         -Monna Dartin.
         -Okay, got it.
       -You okay, Farrah?
          -Yeah, sorry.
            - Got it?
          Okay. Action.
   - Oh, my God, Monna Dartin,
         we're seniors.
    - There's enough calories
      in that to kill you.
      But we all gotta die
          of something.
             - Cut.
      Uh, Sasha, ham it up.
   Don't be afraid to go big.
          - And I think
     your whole performance,
  you could be just a little--
           -Notch up.
            -Boozier.
             -Okay.
          -And action.
     - Mom, stop copying me.
            No wonder
     I'm addicted to speed.
         - I'm addicted
         to speed, too.
        -No, you're not!
        -No, you're not!
              -Mom!
              -Mom!
            -[laughs]
            -And cut.
    Trinity, you were great.
      You were like bang on
    through the whole scene.
          So good job.
      This is a big scene.
  - This is my favorite scene.
       There's two Donnas.
          - Two Donnas.
      -And no Kelly. Yeah.
     -Of course you love it.
      - You're going to be
     talking into a mirror,
 and your actor is not going to
  be there talking back to you,
         so that can get
        really confusing.
     - Kind of like<i> Avatar.</i>
         - It's nothing
          like<i> Avatar.</i>
            -[laughs]
          -And action.
 - Dear darling Monna, of course
     you're still a virgin.
  You're scared of everything.
           - And cut.
     You are like the devil,
   so I would say amp that up.
             -Okay.
          -Like, a lot.
        - Okay, energy up
           and action.
      - But I've never had
         a drink before.
       - Listen, chickie,
     it's plain and simple.
      Get drunk at the prom
     and get yourself laid!
        - But I'm scared.
           - And cut.
     - You did a great job.
  I really believe that you're
     so sweet and innocent.
           -But I am.
            -[laughs]
       - This is the prom,
         you guys, so...
        - Didn't you love
       those dance scenes?
       - No, I hated them.
   They take forever, all day.
             - Yeah.
     - Remember, everybody,
       stay in character.
       If you're a bitch,
   be a bitch the whole time.
      - If you're a whore,
           be a whore.
             - Yeah.
           [all laugh]
    Are you talking about me?
    - No, did I look at you?
           - You did.
    - Places, please, ladies.
             Action.
     - I want to sex you up.
             - Okay.
        - Cut, cut, cut.
          Sorry, guys.
         Kissing scenes
       are always awkward.
       - Mm-hmm. You have
     to touch lips. I mean--
      - You have to make it
           look real.
        - We don't care.
          We'll do it.
    - We'll kiss. We'll kiss.
       - Here comes all of
    Aja's tongue in my mouth.
           - [laughs]
         - We might have
   to get married after this.
             - Cut.
        That is a print.
         Let's move on.
            -Action.
            -Action.
       - We're never going
    to see each other again.
         - Yes, we are.
  We're gall going to the sa--
     I'll start over again.
          Yes, we are.
           We're going
      to the same college.
   We're gonna work together.
             - Cut.
   - Aja, she is a real bitch.
         Let's see that.
           And action.
         - Yes, we are.
         We're all going
      to the same college.
           We're gonna
      work together again.
     - I just have one thing
      to say, and that's--
           Oh, oh, oh!
     I'm not even pregnant.
            -And cut.
            -And cut.
         - Well, I think
      our job here is done.
              -Yep.
   -Aja's performance is meh.
        Shea took a role
      that she didn't want
    and made it really funny.
          You know Aja
     has got to be cracked.

        [Michelle laughs]
         [RuPaul laughs,
           bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
              - Ha!
          - Oh, my hair
        looks sickening.
      - We're getting ready
           for runway,
   and I genuinely feel stupid
   for reacting the way I did
           yesterday.
        I'm embarrassed.
   I'm looking back at, like,
    my little stupid tantrum
    and I'm just laughing now
     because it was so dumb.
        - Well, I'm glad
        you can see that.
      - I definitely, like,
   feel like I made a mistake.
  The only thing you can do now
   is just focus on my runway,
         because I need
        to ace this shit.
 - So I know both of you wanted
     to be my date to prom,
          but I finally
         made my choice.
          I choose me.
           - [laughs]
    - I went to so many proms
         in high school.
        - My junior year,
   I went with a boy to prom.
  We went to our winter formal
            in drag.
              -Yes.
          -Oh, my God.
     - This is my good girl
            Kristin.
        - I went to prom,
      and I won Prom King.
              -Yay!
       -Of course you did.
   - My high school experience
            was bad.
         In high school,
    my grandmother got sick.
         She had cancer.
      So the last two years
         of high school,
   I quit school to take care
        of my grandmother
     and just home schooled
             myself.
 My mother died when I was eight
   from complications of HIV.
             She was
     in the wrong business.
    She was an exotic dancer.
         She did drugs.
         So I was raised
       by my grandparents,
       and my grandmother
       got terminally ill
          when I was 16
     and died when I was 18.
        I never got to do
          like a prom.
        I never got to do
          a senior trip
         or a graduation
     or anything like that.
          I missed out
       on a lot of things
       that kids get to do
         in high school,
     but that was my choice.
      I did that on my own
      because I loved her.
           - I've lost
  so many relatives to cancer.
              -Oh.
  -My dad has multiple myeloma,
  which is in the bone marrow.
   I kind of put up a barrier
      between my dad and I
   when I started doing drag.
   He's just never been a man
 that really expressed his love
    through words or actions
   because he's a military man
  and, you know, conservative.
    And then I think because
    of his cancer diagnosis,
      it's put some things
    into perspective for him.
   One day he gave me a call,
         and he's, like,
   I just want to let you know
   that I love you regardless.
           I know that
     you're just an artist,
            that this
       is your expression.
 And it was the most validating
    experience I've ever had.
     And I just realize that
   my time with him is limited
   and he's actually way more
      accepting and loving
   than I gave him credit for.
         - I know it was
   a real struggle for my mom.
     She actually was, like,
    really not comfortable...
            -Onboard?
         -with the drag.
       - Is that something
     that you struggle with
    feeling unresolved about?
       - Yeah. That's why
        I'm a bald queen.
     When she lost her hair,
            she felt
   she couldn't be beautiful.
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
    - Right after I graduated
          from college,
      my mom was diagnosed
          with cancer.
       Chemo made her lose
        all of her hair.
        I am a bald queen
   to represent for my mother.
 Taking all of that and turning
  that into drag in my own way
  was the most important thing
   I've ever done in my life.
         And I feel like
     the drag queen I am now
      is not the drag queen
  that she got to see, either.
   - I really do believe that
    the people that leave us
         are watching us
         and can see us.
             - Yeah.
           - And I bet
     that she's really proud
          of the queen
       that you've become.
          - Thank you.
        - You should try
       to get up a meeting
   with the Hollywood Medium.
  - You know I offer readings,
             right?
             - Girl,
   you know I'm into Santería
  and all that spiritual stuff.
      - I would like that.
          - Aja Queen,
      the Bed-Stuy medium.
      - We'll get together
            one day.
       - We will do that.
    I'll bring you a chicken.
       - [laughs] Shut up!

  - Oh, that reminds me. I have
   to get dental floss today.
         - Sasha Velour.
   - It's like Sid ate Nancy.
 - I'm representing a side of me
     and a side of Brooklyn
       that is a necessary
         palate cleanser
      from all these, like,
   big hair pageant beauties.
   - Never mind the Bullocks.
           - Bollocks.
     - I'm talking about the
  department store on Wilshire.
             -Yeah.
       -God, I miss that.
          -Not Sandra?
              -No.
          -Peppermint.
     -Take that, Chaka Khan.
     - I am serving classic,
     old school, disco diva
        with a dangerous
          fiery flair.
              -Hot.
              -Yes.
        - Oil treatment.
           [all laugh]
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Jessica Parker.
    - Oh. She's really taking
  this catwalk thing seriously.
        [Michelle laughs]
    - I like to do sex appeal
    and I like to give face.
 Girl, I'm giving you just cat,
       pussy, girl, pussy.
          - Wake me up
      before you calico-co.
              -Ow.
          -Shea Coulee.
       Yes, honey, she is
    going back to her roots.
             -Okay.
           -I say Shea
      is equal parts bougie
           and banji.
    Bitch, I'm really feeling
     the fantasy right now.
          - That's why
        she's so popular.
     She knows how to handle
           a Big Gulp.
       - Alexis Michelle.
           - Oh, look,
   it's Helena Bottom Carter.
         - Yes. [laughs]
       - I am serving you
         some big hair,
           don't care,
    Ursula-inspired sea hag.
   - Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
          Beetlejuice.
              -Aja.
      -Whoomp, there it is.
        - I'm channeling
    a little Queen of Hearts,
   a little Alexander McQueen.
    A lot of queen. [laughs]
          - I know why
       the caged queen...
        - Does something?
           [all laugh]
         -Does she sing?
           -She sings.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
         -You nailed it.
        -You're perfect.
            - It felt
      kind of flat for me.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
   Let's take a look at my new
     favorite show,<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
             -Brrrr!
       -Hush up, Michelle.
         My show is on.
       [theme music plays]
      - Wow, our first day
        at a new school.
       Isn't that awesome?
         - No, it sucks.
   The girl-to-boy ratio here
             blows.
   - Maybe at this new school
 you shouldn't be such a bitch.
    Where's our first class?
        - Let's ask that
    old, old lady over there.
      - Hi. Welcome to West
  Beverly Johnson High School.
    I'm Grandrea Zuckerwoman,
      and I'm a-- [wheezes]
            [coughs]
          I'm a senior.
        - A senior what?
       Were you held back
    for, like, three decades?
      - [laughs and snorts]
       I'm also president
     of the abstinence club.
  - I can see that worked out.
   - Hi, I'm Brandy Schmaltz.
           I'm running
      for class president.
             - Okay.
       You two are tragic.
   Where are the cool people?
    - Oh, you must mean them.
    Nelly, she's the totally
       pretty popular one,
    and that's Monna Dartin,
         the last virgin
      of the class of '93.
   - Oh, my God, Monna Dartin,
         we're seniors.
  - Nelly, look, it's Dillard.
      - Are you guys going
      to the prom together?
    - I haven't decided yet.
      And why is the diner
         in the school?
    - Enough damn questions.
       Here's some fries.
   There's enough cholesterol
      in there to kill you.
             - Mmm.
       - We all gotta die
          of something.
        - But not before
      I lose my virginity.
   - Oh, I was a virgin once.
          Then Mr. Adam
       of the Adam's Apple
     gave me his big, thick,
       juicy, foot-long...
            hot dog?
       - I love hot dogs.
     - I love hot dogs, too!
             - Mom!
    What are you doing here?
         - Senior year.
         I'm so excited.
       And prom is coming.
     - Mom! Stop copying me.
            No wonder
     I'm addicted to speed.
         - I'm addicted
         to speed, too!
        -No, you're not.
        -No, you're not.
              -Mom!
              -Mom!
 - Mom, if you don't cut it out,
     I'm gonna join a cult.
            - Honey,
      don't go without me!
              - Oh!
            - [sighs]
      What's wrong with me?
    Why am I still a virgin?
       - Isn't it obvious?
          -Who's there?
             -Psst.
  I'm right here in the mirror,
            dumb-ass.
            - [gasps]
  - No wonder you're a virgin.
  You're afraid of everything.
      You should get wild.
        - Like, do drugs?
         - No! Remember,
       this is your brain.
  This is your brain on drugs,
         on a croissant.
    - Mmm, sounds delicious.
       - Listen, chickie,
     it's plain and simple.
      Get drunk at the prom
     and get yourself laid!
        - But I'm scared.
           - Go, girl.
    - All right, just a sip.
         [clears throat]
   - So I know you both wanted
     to be my date for prom,
     but I've made my choice
       and I choose...me.
        - I'll date you!
            And you!
           - Oh, Mom!
   I can't believe you joined
      the same cult as me.
               Oh.
     - Eww, this prom sucks.
         - God, Blenda,
     don't be such a bitch!
         - Yeah, because
  I'm Bethani Glamber Gliessen,
      and I'm the new bitch
         in this school.
   - Oh, you can't touch this.
      - Whoo! There it is.
    - I'm too legit to quit.
             - Aah!
     Nice try, you 9021-Ho!
              - Oh!
          [bell rings]
    - Ooh, saved by the bell.
              - Oh.
         I'm outta here.
    I'm gonna go play a witch
           on<i> Charmed.</i>
             - Wow.
    I have never seen anybody
      stand up to my sister
        like that before.
           You're hot.
      I want to sex you up.
       - I was gonna wait
   till college to experiment,
           but...okay.
             - Whoo!
               Oh!
      - What's her problem?
            - Party.
            Who wants
      to take my virginity?
        - Oh, that's it,
          Monna Dartin!
     No drag-uation for you.
        - Wait a minute,
         wait a minute.
      You guys, just stop!
         Look, everybody
         makes mistakes.
    You're a terrible mother.
       You joined a cult.
           You're old
      and you're pregnant.
   - Well, I still don't think
      she should drag-uate.
          - Pipe down.
   You're just a fifth season
          replacement.
            - [gasps]
   - So what do you say, guys?
         Let's give her
         another chance.
   Let Monna Dartin drag-uate.
           [chanting]
     Monna Dartin drag-uate.
     Monna Dartin drag-uate.
            - Well...
              Okay.
              -Yay!
              -Yay!
           [cheering]
             - Aah!
      - Fellow drag-uates,
  I just have one thing to say
           and it's...
             Oh! Oh!
            - Honey,
     your water just broke.
          - 23 skidoo.
        - I can't believe
     we all just drag-uated.
        - Hey, everybody,
        I just realized.
        We're never going
    to see each other again.
         - Yes, we are.
         We're all going
      to the same college.
        And you and Nelly
   are going to have your own
      sitcom on ABC Family.
            - I want
   an ABC Family sitcom, too.
           - Oh, Mom.
       I can't even be mad
        at you right now.
        - Hey, everybody.
       The witch is back.
        -Friends forever.
        -Friends forever.
      [cheers and applause]
           - You guys
       did an amazing job.
        But now it's time
    for the judges' reviews.
          <i> Coming up...</i>
           - I thought
       you were hilarious.
      - You look gorgeous.
       You're a follicular
         tour de force.
    - What did you call her?
     [all laugh, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Farrah Moan.
           Peppermint.
        Alexis Michelle.
      Ladies, you are safe.
    You may leave the stage.
        Now it's time for
  the follica-tease critiques.
      First up, Valentina.
           - I happen
       to love this look.
   I like the way you've also
accessorized it with the gloves,
            which is
    a really beautiful touch.
    - And as Monna Dartin...
        - [clears throat]
            - I mean,
       that's my namesake.
        I thought you had
      a lot of great levels
       and you nailed it.
    - One of the great things
           about Tori
     was that she always did
    a lot of physical comedy,
        and I think that
    you did the role justice.
         You're perfect.
      - Thank you so much.
         -Sasha Velour.
              -Hi.
      - You look different
    from everybody out here.
  And you're on-brand and your
look always has a point of view.
       - It's so on point.
          So on point.
           Literally.
           [all laugh]
     - And your lunch lady.
        I just wanted you
     to go further with it.
     You weren't letting go
           completely.
   - There were a few zingers
in there that quite didn't land.
         - I wish I had
     just played the comedy
        a little bit more
        straightforward.
    And maybe it didn't need
   the Meryl Streep treatment.
         - Yeah, well...
           [all laugh]
        -Trinity Taylor.
       -You look gorgeous.
       You're a follicular
         tour de force.
    - What did you call her?
 - I gotta jump to Nelly's mom,
    because that was amazing.
            I thought
       you were hilarious.
   Your comedy is impeccable.
            - I want
   an ABC Family sitcom, too!
   - You were stealing scenes,
      and it was so right.
     Like, I could lick you
           right now.
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
        Carrington Colby.
       - I love all this.
         The only thing
    that's become predictable
         is that legging
    with a boot and a corset.
  So I want to challenge you to
think of a different silhouette.
    - In<i> 9021-Ho,</i> you weren't
    really selling the lines.
          - I feel like
         directing-wise,
  we did work with you the most
      and we felt nervous.
    We felt nervous you were
     going to be mad at us.
    - You know, it was times
        where I was like,
  they really aren't buying it.
       And then, I started
      getting into my head,
      like, I didn't really
     have fun delivering it.
       - Thank you, Nina.
    Shake a leg, Shea Coulee.
     - So normally when you
     come out on this runway
        in a bathing suit
          and a jacket,
      I'm going to read you
            to filth.
           But you put
     so much character in it
        that I bought it.
        I know that girl.
      She's a working girl
        in New York City
   by the Greyhound terminal.
- In your portrayal as Grandrea,
     you were so confident.
         - Your makeup,
       your body language,
    all of it was perfection.
       - What a brilliant
           character.
           I loved it.
       - Thank you, Tori.
         - Up next, Aja.
    - Your makeup is blended,
        and it just looks
     really, really pretty,
  and I love this hair on you.
    Tonight is quite possibly
  the best you've ever looked.
            - As Ti--
       How do you say it?
       - Bethani. Just say
  that which we don't speak of.
   - Yes. We know her as that
    which we don't speak of.
    You didn't feel grounded
            in that.
       - You were playing
           the bitch.
       She's a mean girl,
and it felt kind of flat for me.
    - Now, Aja, you switched
        with Shea Coulee.
    What frightened you about
     playing the older role?
         - To be honest,
    I just kind of...freaked.
           -Thank you.
           -Thank you.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
   All right, now just between
        us popular kids,
       what do you think?
           Valentina.
       - I thought she did
        a really good job
       just as an actress
    and embodying that part.
        - She was funny,
    she was stumbling around,
          getting into
      her drunk character.
 She was in character the whole
 time until she came off camera
 to tell us that she used watch
   <i> 90210</i> with her babysitter.
  Which made us feel real old.
         - Sasha Velour.
      - Her performance was
 a little underwhelming for me,
    like she could have gone
    so much further with it.
   - She could have sassed the
 character up a little bit more.
        - Trinity Taylor.
      - She played the hell
       out of Nelly's mom.
 She was fully Jennifer Coolidge
     and it was so, so good.
      - She's the ultimate
         scene stealer.
          - Right down
     to her messy lipstick,
   she had the character down.
     - Tonight was a really
    strong night for Trinity.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Ellis Ross.
      - Her acting, for me,
     was a little bit lost.
  - She alluded to there being
    some friction on the set.
         What happened?
     - She was a little bit
           defensive.
    - That's been an ongoing
       storyline with her.
       - We couldn't tell
        if she was angry
     that we were giving her
           direction.
   - Trust me, she was angry.
          - Oh, really?
        See, I told you.
    - She's out there keying
       your car right now.
         - Yes, exactly.
          Shea Coulee.
  - I thought she was fantastic
    in the acting challenge.
       - Shea went for it
         and then some.
   You couldn't help but fall
  in love with this character.
    - But I was so surprised
       when she walked out
         and she looked
      completely different
     than she did yesterday.
  - She slayed the house down.
             - Aja.
          - The acting
         gave me Aja-ta.
           -Oh, dear.
    -I think it's interesting
      that she threw a fit
   about playing the mean girl
 because she wasn't really mean
   and she wasn't really good.
     -She's not even a girl.
             -Hello.
    She basically handed Shea
       a moment to shine.
 There was one note, one thing,
    hair flip over and over.
    - Hey, a lot of actresses
     have made a big career
         on a hair flip
  and one-note bitch delivery.
          - Sure, yeah.
      - But she's not gonna
         be one of them.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
    Bring back my drag-uates.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
           Valentina,
   as Monna Dartin the virgin,
       you really popped.
         Trinity Taylor,
         as Nelly's mom,
      you had it going on.
  Shea Coulee, making us laugh
          like you did
       will never get old.
         Trinity Taylor,
       con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
  You've won a $2,000 gift card
       from Fabric Planet,
       longtime supporters
     of the LGBT experience.
          - Thank you.
       Thank you so much.
     I'm back on top, girls,
       and it feels great.
       - Valentina, Shea,
        you're both safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
        - Aja, your bitch
          was botched.
  Sasha Velour, your lunch lady
         left us hungry.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
          Abdul-Jabbar,
    your acting was too tame
       and I ain't lyin'.
         Sasha Velour...
          you are safe.
      - Thank you so much.
             [sighs]
          - Aja, Nina,
      I'm sorry, my dears,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...

     - Don't take too long,
        'cause you know
         it's showtime.
   Alexis, what are you doing
          down there?
  - ♪ And I'm from Broadway ♪
       - Why you fucking
      look so green, girl?
         - [deep voice]
     I'm not doping, bitch.
           - [laughs]
        You shady ladies
       all did real good.
          [all laugh]
        The winner is...
         Sasha Velour.
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.
          - You've won
        a $500 gift card
        from Today Tix,
        the last minute
      theater ticket app.
        - Trinity's ass
    floats to the top again.
      - All right, ladies,
     it's time to celebrate
       our queer culture
   like only you queens can.
        For this week's
        maxi challenge,
     we're throwing a ball.
   But not just any old ball.
         We're throwing
     the gayest ball ever!
             -Yeah.
              -Ow!
        #GayestBallEver
      You'll need to work
     three different looks,
            each one
 more gay-tastic than the last.
       First category is
     Rainbow-She-Betta-Do.
         We want to see
         a flaming look
            inspired
      by the rainbow flag.
       Second category is
         Sexy Unicorn.
             -Yes!
             -Ooh.
       - Hooves and horns
      and queens. Oh, my!
          [all laugh]
       Third category is
         Village People
     Eleganza Extravaganza.
              -Oh.
             -Shit.
         - Each of you
     needs to create a look
inspired by the legendary group
      the Village People.
      That's cowboy, cop,
        Native American,
      construction worker,
   and leather biker couture.
           Rrr, rrr.
     So I'm gonna head over
          to the YMCA
        and let you guys
         pick your own
  Village Person inspiration.
      Start your engines,
  and may the best woman win.
            [laugh]
        - We all agreed
     to be very diplomatic
       with the selection
  of the Village People look.
       I end up choosing
     the leather biker look
    because it's all black,
    and everybody looks good
         in all black.
             - Aah!
       Police brutality.
    Hits too close to home.
    - I chose the cop look.
      I'm trying to, like,
    let loose a little bit,
   be a little bit more edgy.
        So, Peppermint,
      what are you making?
       - I'm just trying
           to go for
             a very
    hyper-feminized version
  of the leather daddy/mommy.
    - Pepper, are you going
    for like a fetishy look?
     - I don't really have
        much experience
  with the leather community.
         I'm more like
    the pleather community.
          [all laugh]
          - Peppermint
    has a great personality.
  She has a great personality.
         But her looks,
   they're just not polished,
        so that could be
         her downfall.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      What do you think is
going to be your winning ticket?
      - I can always count
         on my smarts.
      - I want to do like
    a patchwork, big skirt--
       - Wait. Let me put
         my earring on.
           - Uh-huh.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         - For today's
        maxi challenge,
      we're getting ready
   for the gayest ball ever.
    I'm gonna shit glitter.
           - I chose
      the Native American.
    I want to give something
         that will feel
      a little bit tribal,
    but also ready to wear.
    What I need to use is an
 editing eye in this challenge
          to make sure
      that it feels fresh.
       This is my chance
         to say, like,
         I'm not basic,
         I have taste.
     - Alexis needs to push
     her aesthetic further.
   She needs to modernize it.
          I feel like
     I could go to New York
       and throw a stone
   and hit five other queens
          that can do
     exactly what she does.
            - Hi-ee.
              -Hi.
            -Hello.
     - I'm here. I'm queer.
        Get used to it.
     [cheers and laughter]
          -Hey, Sasha.
          -Hi, RuPaul.
  - Now, you chose the cowboy?
    - Yeah, the cowboy seems
  like a winning choice to me,
        and this fabric
         is incredible.
        But constructing
   is not my strongest suit,
        so I have to be
       very, very clever.
   - Yeah. What do you think
  is gonna be your trump card?
         Oh, did I say
          fuck Trump?
          - Not today.
        - Not on the day.
          - Not today.
- What do you think is gonna be
      your winning ticket?
      - I can always count
          on my smarts
   to push me over the edge.
        - So how are you
      going to reinterpret
       the rainbow flag?
      - Well, it really is
       quite a challenge,
            because
     I'm breaking it apart.
       I'm deconstructing
         the rainbow--
        God, that sounds
      overly intellectual,
      but I promise I have
      an interesting trick
       up my sleeve that
    I'm excited to pull out.
            - Sasha
    is really, really, deep
   and puts a lot of thought
         into her drag,
           and that's
       both an advantage,
         but it's also
    kind of a disadvantage.
     'Cause if nobody knows
   what the hell is going on,
        what difference
      does it make anyway?
            - Whoo.
       - Alexis Michelle.
         - Hi, RuPaul.
   - Now, which character in
  the Village People are you--
         - Wait. Let me
       put my earring on.
       Maybe you'll have
 some sense of what I'm doing.
         Am I the cop?
           - I think
  you're the Native American.
   - I'm the Native American.
     - And why'd you choose
           that one?
       - I saw this bowl
       of these beautiful
   turquoise embellishments,
      and they spoke to me
          immediately,
   and I said, you know what?
  Build the look around these.
           - Uh-huh.
        Now, last week,
 the judges had some critiques
     about your aesthetic.
             -Yes.
   -How'd that make you feel?
          - You know,
       it hurt, actually.
     I did sew my bodysuit
          and leotard.
They weren't Halloween costumes
      I bought in a store.
       - It was just that
     the outfit you created
    wasn't two steps beyond.
        - I think I'm on
   the right track this time,
         and it's time
       to be that Phoenix
          and rise up
      out of those ashes.
   - Good, because, you know,
  we're down to the wire here.
          This is it.
         - This is it.
    - I've chosen something
        very ambitious,
   with the amount of stoning
      that I intend to do
        to this bodice.
        Now is the time
    I've really got to show
  that I belong here visually.
           -Hi, Shea.
           -Hey, Ru.
        - I see lots of
construction worker stuff here.
        Why'd you choose
    the construction worker?
     - I'm a really big fan
      of British fashion,
  you know, Vivienne Westwood,
           Burberry.
      and so I want to do,
      like, an interesting
     kind of like patchwork
           big skirt
        that has, like,
        a lot of, like,
     punk unfinished edges,
   but still really polished
      and fashion forward.
       - Oh, my goodness.
      That's a tall order.
      Now, Shea, last week
          you wound up
       in the bottom two
      for the first time.
     Did that shake you up?
          - Oh, girl,
        it shook me up.
       It shook me down.
    It shook me all around.
- This challenge will determine
        the final four,
      so this is big time.
        This is no joke.
          - Yeah, no.
         My performance
    in last week's challenge
   was just a one time deal.
       Ain't no slip-ups
       from here on out.
     - All right, ladykins,
         gather round.
   Now, tomorrow, in addition
   to your three ball looks,
     I want you to perform
       an opening number
      that pays tribute to
the gayest Olympic sport ever...
      rhythmic gymnastics.
     [cheers and laughter]
      [cheers and screams]
         And that's how
     you get the gold medal
      here at "Drag Race."
           [cheering]
       Now, Sasha Velour,
    you won the bitch fest,
      so you're in charge
      of the choreography.
        - Okay. [laughs]
        - So good luck,
     and don't fuck it up.
     [cheers and laughter]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
             - Ow!
         - Oh, my God.
       Are you all right?
           - Sasha's
   certainly not delivering.
         This rehearsal
    feels kind of unfocused.
       - Crack the whip.
     - I have been trying.
            - Wham!
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
            - Whoo!
    - [laughs] Now it's time
       for us to rehearse
    our rhythmic gymnastics
            routine.
      - All right, ladies,
       let's get to work.
   - I still don't even know
  what rhythmic gymnastics is,
    but I'm gonna find out.
    - One thing that I loved
  that I saw the Olympians do
           is, like,
   they hold out these things
         so we can have
    that pull apart moment.
          - Yes. So...
    - One, two, three, four.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
    - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
     - This is ridiculous.
         - Okay, okay,
   let's focus, let's focus.
      - One, two, three--
      - No, wait, Trinity.
   - One, two, three, four--
             - Ow!
         - Oh, my God.
       Are you all right?
         - Oh, my God.
           Is it red?
         - No, not yet.
- Bitches getting their ribbons
         tied in knots,
  getting slapped in the face.
         It's actually
    not as easy as it looks.
         - Okay, okay,
  so going from the beginning,
      I come up on three,
     and then all together
        we do something
        on four, right?
            - Yeah.
   And for the next section,
           can we do
    five, six, seven, eight?
         - No. What if
     the first time--okay.
   So what if the first time
  we put Alexis in the middle?
      - Sasha's certainly
        not delivering.
         This rehearsal
    feels kind of unfocused.
   I grew up in the theater.
      I know what it means
   to stage a musical number,
    so I have a perspective
        that could help
       the team out here.
           Can I make
     a suggestion, ladies?
    What do you think about
       storm the judges,
        give good face?
        - I'd rather not
     let it down, actually.
    I think it'll be sloppy
         picking it up.
       I want to keep it
     as simple as possible.
 - Are you guys all comfortable
    with, like, a battement?
     So if we were like...
         ♪ Let it rise
        with attitude ♪
             -Okay.
        -Shea and Sasha
     think that their ideas
         are the best.
        My point of view
      is just pushed aside
        as second rate.
    May I suggest that we do
     figure eights in place
     for one, two, three--
  - Well, that's gonna change
        how we get off.
         - Well, maybe
    if we just move faster.
         [all talking]
     - I don't want to move
          any faster.
          - I do like
      adding the movement.
     - All right, you guys.
    We need to just decide.
   - There's too many chiefs
    and not enough Indians.
        Crack the whip.
     - I have been trying.
      - Sasha's too nice,
      'cause I would have
   bitched slapped somebody.
             Wham!
  And then twirled my ribbon.
      - And back to work.
        - Motherfucker.
    - How's everybody's look
         coming along?
        -It's horrible!
           -[laughs]
   - I am fucking terrified.
           - Sasha's
      rainbow runway look,
     it's very pedestrian.
      - I'm doing the most
 time consuming part right now.
    It's going to be, like,
 a patchwork on, like, flannel.
  - So you're making a costume
       for Adore Delano?
             -Ooh.
           -[laughs]
    - I didn't know she was
  part of the Village People,
           but okay.
     - Well, no, she wasn't
 a part of the Village People,
     but she was top three,
          unlike you.
       - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
    - I'm just not impressed
            by Shea.
         Cut-off shorts
   and a wife beater? Really?
       Does it look like
     a construction worker?
           Bitch, no.
       So how do you feel
   about the routine, Sasha?
        - I feel, um...
     I feel good about it.
  These are very fun to watch,
     these spinning ribbons.
      - If you're a kitty.
     - Even if you're not.
      - I'm glad it wasn't
    any longer than it was.
      - Ru better give us
          sunglasses,
      'cause it's getting
    hella shady up in here.
          - Honestly--
            - Uh-oh.
        Get ready, girl.
         - I think that
       the dance element
   is not your comfort zone,
   and I saw your insecurity
          around that,
  and it came out a little bit
       in your behavior.
        - I don't think
      that I was insecure
    in the rehearsal at all.
         To be honest,
  I was not being listened to.
  - I don't think you stood up
      as a leader, though.
    - In my opinion, she was
   trying to steer the ship,
         and all of us
were just, like, blah-blah-blah.
      - I did not feel you
       steering the ship.
          - It's clear
        that my strategy
     did not work for you,
          Miss Alexis.
     - Frankly, I also feel
  like you sort of explicitly
           trust Shea
       and Shea's vision
     more than other folks.
        - Actually, no.
        I felt like Shea
    was stepping on my toes
         a little bit.
  - I was honesty just sharing
      my ideas, you know.
        - You definitely
    just, like, straight up
         talked over me
       a bunch of times,
  and it was very challenging.
       - It's going to be
         a tough battle
    to get to the top four.
   I see the claws come out.
       Rreer! Pfft, pfft.
       It ain't<i> RuPaul's</i>

     - Let's get this ball
            rolling.
          Category is
     Rainbow-She-Betta-Do.
     First up, Shea Coulee.
     - Graffiti Nefertiti.
 - I decided to go in a little
  bit of a different direction
         and do a dress
       that is graffiti,
      and I'm just feeling
       this look so much.
       - Tag, you're it.
       [Michelle laughs]
         Sasha Velour.
         Oh, gorgeous.
  - Color blocking perfection.
   - I'm giving a little nod
     to "The Wizard of Oz"
 and the importance of Dorothy
     to the gay community.
             - Oh.
      - Honey, I am home.
   - Careful, before someone
     drops a house on you.
       [Michelle laughs]
          - I'm filing
      for "section great."
          [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
        - Rainbow Brite.
             - Yes.
          - This look
     is literal Pride flag.
         Bright, loud,
       colorful, stripey.
      -Taste the rainbow.
             -Mmm.
       - Trinity Taylor.
 - That gives whole new meaning
          to strap-on.
  - I'm giving you gay rainbow
   with a dash of dark lady.
      - I wonder what's at
    the end of her rainbow.
     -I just want her ass.
            -Uh-huh.
          [all laugh]
         - Peppermint.
   - Ooh, I wonder if her rug
      matches her drapes.
          [all laugh]
           - My look
    is a classic Pride look.
      I'm a classic beauty
     with a classic booty,
       and I'm working it
    like there is no other.
   - This look brought to you
          by Skittles.
  - Category is Sexy Unicorn.
          Shea Coulee.
     She's the black horse
      of this competition.
      - 50 Shades of Shea.
        - I'm giving you
   dark and lovely stallion.
      You can just call me
         Neigh Coulee.
           -Spank it.
              -Oh.
  Does she make you unicorn-y?
          [all laugh]
         Sasha Velour.
             - Oh.
     - It's the Chronicles
          of Drag-nia.
      -Lord of the Hooves.
             -Yes.
  - When I think of a unicorn,
 I think of medieval tapestry,
      and I'm just selling
      that fantasy beast.
     - The tip of her horn
          is bleeding.
        I think this is
       a period costume.
          [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
   Now, she's a real hoofer.
       - I am a glittery,
         gold unicorn.
     Look at these hooves.
     You know what they say
  about big hooves, don't you?
   - Now, that's what I call
          a fairytale.
         - She's really
       feeling her oats.
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - She's got so much energy,
     it's like Lisa Crank.
          [all laugh]
      - It's every little
    gay boy's pony fantasy:
    bubblegum, cotton candy,
  My Little Pony, and I live.
         - Yeah, shake
      those tail feathers.
          Peppermint.
         - Horn-raiser.
       - My sexy unicorn
      is a space unicorn.
       I start to realize
        that my garment
       is a little baggy
        in some places,
   so I have to kind of move
      very strategically.
  - Unicorn? I don't remember
        eating unicorn.

     Eleganza Extravaganza.
  Serving construction worker
     couture, Shea Coulee.
           You better
       construction work.
       - I deconstructed
a whole bunch of flannel shirts
        to make a cape.
    I got my hair wrapped up
          in a turban
     'cause you do not want
    them edges to sweat out.
    I am feeling invincible.
          - Nailed it.

    Serving Native American

         - Hey, Alexis,
        how's your head?
     - I'm so thrilled with
  how this bodice turned out.
      I feel current, chic
           and I look
    like a million dollars.
       - Well, somebody's
     gonna need an aspirin.
          [all laugh]
     - Serving cop couture,
        Trinity Taylor.
     - I like this because
it goes from daytime to welding
         in one simple
       tilt of the head.
      - I'm feeling strong
           and sexy.
 I'm the bad cop that's coming
   for all the naughty boys.
          Spread 'em.
      - Yeah, she is armed

    make them all my slaves.
   You better call me Master.
            Wha-tch!
    - I think you got a date
        later on, honey.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     Ladies, I have to ask,
          who deserves
  to go home tonight and why?
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
       - Welcome, ladies.
         It's time for
     the judges' critiques,
   starting with Shea Coulee.
         - Your rainbow
    was not rainbow at all,
    but it was so stunning.
         - I just felt
 coming out in rainbow stripes
  would have been predictable.
   - Right, but there wasn't
    one color of the rainbow
       in there. Not one.
  - This particular look that
   you're wearing right now,
      I think it's great.
      I love the details.
          But for me,
       the crowning glory
       is that patchwork
   flannel shirt/cape combo.
 - Gives, like, a street style
 model off-duty meets couture,
          and I would
       totally wear that,
           so I hope
    we share the same size.
   - Can we see that jacket?
  Can you spin around for us?
             - Wow.
           -Riveting.
             -Yes.
       - No, that's what
     she was doing earlier.
          [all laugh]
       - Thank you, Shea.
          - Thank you.
    - Up next, Sasha Velour.
       - Let's start with
   your rhythmic gymnastics.
     You had this psychotic
  Dorothy Hamill feel to you.
     You had this plastered
   weird smile on your face.
    It was really well done.
- I'm a little bit in love with
 you in general, I have to say.
  There's something extremely
    modern about your style.
      - This cowboy look,
 the details here are so great.
          Super chic.
        - Your unicorn.
  It was executed flawlessly.
    - And your rainbow look,
I loved when you removed the hat
        and you gave us
   Little House On The Fairy.
       That was amazing.
  - Up next, Alexis Michelle.
      - The gold unicorn,
       I really liked it.
      There was something
    very childlike about it.
       - For the rainbow,
   I feel it was too literal.
   If they give you a theme,
       you should be able
  to take me there, you know.
   And I felt like it needed
 a little bit more of a oomph.
          And you look
     incredibly beautiful,
     but I feel if we take
   the bow out of your head,
     I can get that outfit
          at Ricky's.
       It's a little bit
          lackluster.
   - I would love to see this
    taken way over the top.
           These two,
     they're taking an idea
   and giving it a real twist
   and just going balls deep,
          if you will.
   - This is the final five,
    and there's so much more
   that could have been done.
     - I nearly went blind
      stoning this thing.
           - Got it.
      Still underwhelming.
            - Okay.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      - The rainbow look.
    Does it look good? Yeah.
         Is it the best
       you could do? No.
       This is more like
   bar Trinity back at home.
       - Let's talk about
   this runway look tonight.
    I think this is so chic
       and so glamorous,
 and all of those little badges
    and pins are phenomenal.
     The hair, the makeup,
  the visor, it's really cool.
         - It's tough.
       At the same time,
         it's feminine.
     The ass looks amazing.
            [laughs]
     I need to take myself
     to the gym after this.
     - No, just the doctor.
          [all laugh]
     - Up next, Peppermint.
        - Your unicorn,
         that was fun,
         but there was
  a little bagginess going on
     in the crotch-al area.
  - The rainbow I really loved
     because it was kind of
          French diva.
     I had an instant flash
       of being in Paris,
    and I wanted to meet you
     in the park at night.
          [all laugh]
       - What did you do
       in France, Andie?
          - In Paris.
      Just call me anytime
 you're going to parties, okay?
- And then, this look, you know,
    the silhouette is great.
    I love all the details.
   - As soon as you came out
the runway, like, you owned it.
        And I felt like
   you were gonna beat me up,
         but I loved it
       at the same time.
         It was, like,
  I just loved the whole idea.
          - Thank you.
- Ladies, at this crucial point
      in the competition,
  I have to ask, who deserves
  to go home tonight and why?
          Let's start
       with Shea Coulee.
     - I would have to say
        Alexis Michelle.
        - Sasha Velour.
            - Alexis
      did really struggle.
   I would have to say Alexis
            as well.
    - Very interesting that
     they're not supportive
      of my look right now
    in front of the judges,
      considering they had
      nothing to say to me
   about it in the workroom.
     Fucking shady whores.
          - All right.
        Alexis Michelle.
           - Frankly,
  I'd have to say Peppermint.
   She has a one-in-a-million
          personality,
  and I think that she's able
         to sell looks
  that aren't always finished.
       - Trinity Taylor,
         same question.
   - A huge pet peeve of mine
    is not paying attention
          to details,
     so I would have to say
          Peppermint.
    - All right, Peppermint.
           Your turn.
       - Probably because
 she is my biggest competition,
        Trinity Taylor.
   - Well, thank you, ladies.
  I think we've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
   All right. So just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think?
 Let's start with Shea Coulee.
           - Overall,
   I love everything she did.
          The unicorn
       was very powerful.
    - Construction couture,
            amazing.
      One of my favorites.
- Her rainbow look did not read
   rainbow to me whatsoever.
   - I could see in the movie
      "Paris Is Burning,"
  people would be on the floor
           shouting,
   it is not a rainbow dress!
            - I get
    what everyone is saying,
       but the fact that
she included makeup on her body,
    it was like an artwork.
         - Shea Coulee
     came here to compete,
  and she knows how to do it.
         Sasha Velour.
     - I love Sasha because
    I think she's original.
     - She gave us rainbow
   in a really different way,
      and the unicorn look
    stood out from the herd.
          [all laugh]
          I just think
      she's chic as fuck.
       - Her cowboy look
   was absolutely beautiful,
    but it was more fashion
       than it was drag.
         - Yeah, I come
     to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
  not just to see a look that
    I'm going to go to Paris
       and I can see that
         down a runway.
      Like, I just needed
   to be taken to that dream,
       that fantasy land.
     - You know, I'm torn,
  because everything Sasha did
   was absolutely fantastic.
      But is it gag-worthy
          for a ball?
         We're looking
    for the Harlem children
  to be saying, you are over.
         You are over.
   Miss Thing, you are over.
        Alexis Michelle.
   - Her rhythmic gymnastics
             thing,
      she just had so much
       enthusiasm for it
      and she gave us like
 Mary Lou Retton 1986 realness.
   - Every time she came out
         on the stage,
    I was just so captivated
         by her beauty.
      But everything else
   kind of like fell through.
 - To me, that Native American
     fell completely short.
         So many things
      she could have done
   to make it so much better
     and so much draggier.
   And it looked like a shake
and go that she had on tonight.
         - The look was
    a little bit pedestrian.
- Again, we have to look at this
    as this is the top five
   and this is when you bring
    the best that you have.
             - Yes.
       - Trinity Taylor.
      - The rainbow look,
  that was a real miss for me.
      We need wow factor.
        I want that look
        to be an event,
       and that was like
         an appetizer.
       - And the unicorn,
     it wasn't my favorite,
      but I still thought
      it was a lot of fun.
   - Even though her unicorn
      wasn't that special,
       she sold the fuck
       out of that thing.
        - Yeah, she did.
   - Her final look, however,
       was so fantastic.
      Everything about it,
         from the hair
       down to the bottom
      just worked for me.
        - Pep, Pep, Pep.
     What's up, Peppermint?
        - I don't think
      she was a stand out
   in the rhythmic gymnastics
            number.
   I didn't notice if she did
   a great job or a bad job.
     I just didn't notice.
       That's a problem.
  - Her unicorn was definitely
    out of her comfort zone.
  She had a "Hellraiser" thing
    going on with her head,
          and the idea
   was very forward thinking.
  - But it kind of was ruined
       because the pieces
      didn't fit properly.
      - But the last look,
    I felt like she owned it
   and it was so intimidating
      and just empowering.
    - And I love the way she
 commanded the runway with it.
       She was connecting
        with all of us.
         You could tell
      that she was living.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
           Bring back
       my Village People.
           - [laughs]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
Sasha Velour, your three fashion
   looks really roped us in.
  Shea Coulee, your three ball
    looks gagged the judges.
          Shea Coulee,
       con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winner
   of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
   You've won two VIP tickets
     to<i> Cirque Du Soleil's</i>
  sexy adult cabaret<i> Zumanity,</i>
  including airfare and deluxe
   Las Vegas accommodations.
             - Yes!
     Being in the top four
         feels so good.
    I am feeling invincible.
  - Sasha Velour, you're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - You may step
   to the back of the stage.
       - Alexis Michelle,
  your Native American couture
        left the judges
       with reservations.
    I'm sorry, my dear, but
  you are up for elimination.
- I'm pretty angry being placed
  in the bottom for this week.
     Frankly, I think what
  I'm wearing is more fashion
       than what Trinity
  and Peppermint are wearing.
       - Trinity Taylor,
        your cop rocked,
      but your other looks
     weren't as arresting.
          Peppermint,
 your leather queen dominated,
  but your unicorn and rainbow
      were a little light
        in the loafers.
Peppermint, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
  Trinity Taylor, you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
      The time has come...
           [thunder]
          to lip synch
    [echoing] for your life.
           Good luck
     and don't fuck it up.

     I've made my decision.
          Peppermint,
       shantay, you stay.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
       - Alexis Michelle,
   to misquote Liza Minnelli,
    if you can make it here,
   you can make it anywhere.
          - [sobbing]
       Thank you so much.
       - Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
           [applause]
      Dream big, my girls.
   I'm not really surprised.
     It just wasn't my day.
      I know it looks like
         I'm super sad,
     and the truth is I am.
  I mean, it's hard to go home
     right before the end.
          But I think
    what I'm really feeling
     is this was something
    I wanted for so, so long
     and I'm finally here.
       I've learned that
     I have what it takes.
        Let this statue
     be the first of many.
          You like me.
      You really like me.
      - Well, look at you,
          my fab four.
       Con-drag-ulations.
         And remember,
  if you can't love yourself,
    how in the hell are you
   going love somebody else?
           Can I get
      an amen up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!

        - [laughs] Okay.

      That is not the case.

          Shea Coulee,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
            Valentina
     and Nina Bo'nina Brown,
   you are up for elimination.
     Stop. Hold up, hold up.
       Valentina, this is
    a lip sync for your life.
    We need to see your lips.
         Take that thing
       off of your mouth.
           - I'd like
     to keep it on, please.
       - It's a lip sync.
        What part of that
     do you not understand?
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
     Valentina, sashay away.
             - Girl.
      - What just happened?
           - Valentina
      was just eliminated,
     and we are all shocked.
          - "I love you
      with all of my heart.
            Kisses."
        - Oh, Valentina.
        - Oh, Valentina.
    - I'm so stunned, though.
          I don't know
     what got into her head.
     - But that being said,
     Nina, you earned that.
            Not only
     did you know the words,
            you like
       put on a fun show.
         -Come on, Nina.
           -Go, Nina.
  [chanting] Nina! Nina! Nina!
  - Yeah, I mean, it was cute.
     I did what I had to do.
   But for me, this is, like,
   not, like, a happy moment.
        I feel horrible.
           I feel bad
    because I feel like maybe
          if she wasn't
      in the group with me,
          she probably
      would still be here.
              -No.
           -No, Nina.
    - You can't take that on,
              girl.
     That ain't your fault.
          - Oh, my God.
           Not again.
       - I'm just saying,
      hear me out, y'all--
   before y'all curse me out,
 the negative one is still here
     and the positive one--
          - But, Nina,
     we're rooting for you.
    The way you just fought,
       that was beautiful.
  - Yeah, but I just feel bad.
          - It's tough
      being in the bottom,
          but is there
      a little piece of you
      that feels victorious
           after this?
              - No.
       I can't explain it.
       I can't explain it.
      - Can we stop talking
      about this, actually?
           -This is--
             -Sorry,
         I'm not having
       this conversation.
           I love you.
    That's all I have to say.
    I've never heard of that
  in any situation in humanity.
  I need to make you feel good
         about the fact
    that you did a great job?
     So I'm not gonna do it.
           Bitch, snap
       the fuck out of it.
 - I guess I don't really care,
that's the thing, like I should,
          but I don't.
         I'm not asking
    for anybody to go, like,
      oh, Nina, it's okay.
         I mean, that's
     what they chose to do.
     - We've asked ourselves
         how many times
           did we try
    to snap her out of this,
  and the answer is it's over.
      - These conversations
  are not helping her, clearly.
           It may even
      be doing more damage.
   This is not group therapy.
     This is a competition.
         We just cannot
          fight for her
 in a way that she's not willing
      to fight for herself.
      I'm tired of spending
         all of our time
       together as a group
   trying to build someone up
  who doesn't want to hear it.
          I am over it.
       - That doesn't mean
     we don't support Nina,
    but it's time to move on.
    I'm over it, I'm over it,
          I'm over it.
      She needs to go home.
           No, no, no.
          I'm over it.

     - Hello, hello, hello.
      [cheers and applause]
           - It's Ru.
       - Now, in the past,
    I've challenged my queens
           to do some
    pretty special makeovers.
          Gay veterans,
        Stonewall heroes,
        and Little Women,
       just to name a few.
         But this season
     promises to be the most
    extra special one of all.
    And we don't have to look
           any further
  than just behind the camera.
         For this week's
         maxi challenge,
        you'll be giving
    our beloved crew members
   the chance to strut a mile
        in your shoes...
    [laughter and screaming]
   In a makeover sponsored by
    Anastasia Beverly Hills.
            Oh, crew?
           [all laugh]
    Now who do I want to see
    all prettied up in drag?
             Sarge.
           [all laugh]
             Aaron.
      [cheers and applause]
             Rizzo.
     [laughter and applause]
    Brady, come on over here.
     [laughter and applause]
              Josh.
             - Yes!
     - Okay, just one more.
             Duncan.
     [screams and laughter]
    Gentlemen, say your name
        and what you do.
          - I'm Sarge.
     I'm a camera operator.
           - I'm Aaron
   and I'm an art coordinator.
          - I'm Rizzo.
        I am a set P.A.,
        and I pretty much
 make sure that they're in drag
        when we tell them
         to be in drag.
      - Oh, how the tables
          have turned.
           [all laugh]
       - My name's Brady.
 I work in the audio department,
         and I make sure
          you all sound
    as beautiful as you look
         every episode.
             -Aw...
             -Aw...
         - Hey, queens.
        My name is Josh.
       You see me around.
           I'm a P.A.
          - I'm Duncan.
   I'm the associate director.
    We're all in Ru's house.
       When Ru's not here,
         it's my house.
           [all laugh]
       - Ladies, these men
     are like family to me.
         Now I want you
       to share with them
            firsthand
      the miracle of drag.
        #RuCrewMakeovers
           [all laugh]
  And we've got these gorgeous
          RockStar wigs
       to top things off.
 Shea and Sasha, since you both
   won last week's challenge,
   you get to pair the queens
         with the crew.
    First, who do you choose
         for yourselves?
           Shea first.
             - Josh.
           - Oh, damn!
         - I picked Josh
        because obviously
      we share the closest
       family resemblance.
        - I like a strong
       and powerful woman,
    so I'm going with Duncan.
           [all laugh]
      I feel like Duncan's
           so serious
    when he's being our A.D.,
        and I want to see
        his playful side.
             - Nina,
     we're going to pair you
        with the lovely,
         artistic Aaron.
          - All right.
  - Ain't no shenanigans here.
          We really try
     and match the girls up
        with someone that
       at least feels like
        their personality
       will match up well.
       - With Peppermint,
      we are putting Sarge.
     [laughter and applause]
       - Who do you choose
          for Trinity?
             -Rizzo.
             -Rizzo.
     [laughter and applause]
      - Which means Alexis
   will be making over Brady.
           [applause]
         -Come to mama.
              -Yes.
        - Now, remember,
   the judges will be looking
          for a strong
    drag family resemblance.
      So don't fuck it up.
          - So you said
        you're an artist.
    - I'm a graphite artist,
   you know, outside of work,
   you know, a pencil artist.
       - 'Cause I do drag,
    but I don't just do drag.
       I do like artistic
  and different kind of things.
       - Dope. I dig this.
        Do you want to do
       like creature like?
     - Yeah. I'm thinking--
     - I think that would be
          fucking cool.
 - And I keep having this vision
     of like a white rabbit.
          - Hell, yeah.
       - But the thing is
  getting the garment together.
          That's where
       the trick comes in.
     Y'all know I don't sew.
             For me,
       my drag is my face,
    but I wanted to show that
       I can try to create
     something from scratch.
       So I decide to sew.
            [laughs]
             - Hip.
        - One of my major
      inspirations for drag
       is Naomi Campbell.
   That strength, that power,
        that confidence.
    So, like, what are some,
    like, female celebrities
    that, like, come to mind
     when you're just, like,
    I like the way she looks
         when I see her
       on the red carpet?
        - I have a thing
      for Natalie Portman.
       - Natalie Portman?
     She don't really match
     with the Coulee brand.
   I want you to just give me,
  like, your best runway walk.
         Let me have it.
        I know your mama
      don't walk like that.
    Don't think about putting
 the emphasis in your shoulders.
      Take all that energy
         and channel it
         into your hips.
    You really want to, like,
  loosen, like, all of this up.
        So try it again.
       I'm gonna watch you
          from behind.
   - Have you ever seen a dog
          walk in snow?
             - Ooh.
     - It's just like that.
    Your sister looks strong.
        - She is strong.
        - And I'm talking
        about that walk.
           - [laughs]
          - Bye, girl.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     Oh, and one more thing.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
           - Oh, fuck.
        - Walk naturally.
        Go to the store.
        - Okay. Oh, God.
          - Oh, Jesus.
  - This week's maxi challenge
           is to turn
      the "Drag Race" crew
     into our drag sisters.
    Okay, I'm known for body,
     so I would like to make
       a swimsuit for you.
         How do you feel
         about tucking?
          - Gonna hurt.
     - But with a swimsuit,
  it's, like, it's very there.
     You gotta pull it back
          or I'm gonna
      pull it back for you.
             - Oh...
          - With Rizzo,
    I'm gonna crack the whip.
    I haven't won a challenge
         in a few weeks,
   and so I have to work hard
          and show them
        that I'm gonna go
          all the way.
       - Hey, kitty girls.
              -Hey.
              -Hey.
           - How's my
       2 Live Crew doing?
             -Good.
             -Good.
           - [laughs]
           Hey, Brady.
    - Well, hello there, Ru.
          -Hi, Alexis.
              -Hi.
   - Now, you've just sort of
   dipped your toe in so far.
     What personality traits
          are emerging?
 - Oh, the bitch and the diva's
       already coming out.
            - Really?
   - You know, we're supposed
 to adopt the same personality.
     I think it's happening
           naturally.
        - Well, like I've
     always said, you know,
  drag actually reveals your--
      I knew I was powerful
            in drag.
      It didn't occur to me
    that I could utilize that
   in other areas of my life.
    - So you telling me that
   I'm co-hosting next season?
           - [laughs]
           - Fuck you,
        Michelle Visage.
       We don't need you.
             - Aah!
             Oh, no!
    - I know your girlfriend
    is a big fan of the show.
  Is that why you're doing it?
      - No. I mean, before
   I started working with you,
    I really kind of thought
        that it was just
   a man dressed like a woman
    and that kind of was it.
     But I'm starting to see
    all the different aspects
       of drag or others,
       the comedic drags,
           and there's
      like the runway drags
          and the fish.
              -Yes.
    -That's a new one for me.
    That was new this season.
            - Uh-huh.
 - There's no way I could say no
      to this opportunity.
   - Now, Alexis, you were in
   the bottom three last week.
         - Yes. I don't
     want to be there again,
   and I know that we're going
  to put our best foot forward.
  - We're already a good team.
          - All right.
        Get back to work.
            -Will do.
           -Thank you.
       - Well, well, well.
        Duncan and Sasha.
      Now, you're cinched.
       How does that feel?
        - Feels good, Ru.
          - [all laugh]
       - She's a natural.
      - Now, you have a boy
           and a girl.
         I've met them.
         They're lovely.
   What's your family going to
   think about daddy in drag?
        - I think my son
   will probably have pointers
     on how I walk in heels.
        Since he was two,
    he loves clomping around
       in my wife's, so...
      - It is so much fun.
        If I had a daddy
      who was brave enough
      to use all the colors
       in the crayon box,
      that would have been
         life changing.
      So thank you so much.
   - I want to do RuPaul proud
    with my Duncan makeover.
         The two of them
        have a great love
   and respect for each other,
     and so I really, really
       cannot disappoint.
  - Now, Duncan, you have seen
     the queens come and go
      for years and years.
           What advice
      have you given Sasha?
      - To try and stay out
        of your own head.
              - Mm.
        - We talked about
 over-intellectualizing things,
   and that getting in the way
       of just being free.
      - How do you do that?
            - Drugs.
   - You know, I'm pretty sure
       this is going to be
           my favorite
    all-time challenge ever.
       -Can't wait, Sasha.
          -I'm excited.
         - Turn it out.
     - Right. I know we both
   have the same battle here.
           - Gorgeous.
       - Oh, my goodness.
        - Oh, hello, Ru.
          How are you?
      - I am over the moon.
         Sarge, how long
       have you been here?
        - Since Season 4.
   - You know, you and I joke.
   Sometimes I'll shoot a look
          over to you,
    and there's an intellect
    and there's a fun energy
      that comes from you.
    - I would agree with you
            tenfold.
       I definitely caught
       a really open vibe
     from Sarge right away.
     - Yeah. I've never seen
      any sort of judgment
      about our girls here.
        - No, no, no, no.
         Absolutely not.
         I never thought
     before doing this show
  I would have as much respect
    for drag queens as I do.
            I'm just
      absolutely flattered
     to be able to document
     those life experiences.
     - Now, how did you get
         the name Sarge?
       - I was a sergeant
          in the army.
        - Well, if you've
    been through all of that,
           doing drag
       is a piece of cake.
             -Uh-uh.
              -No?
            - Huh-uh.
           [all laugh]
    I'm scared shitless, Ru.
   - I think you'll be great.
         But, you know,
    we're in the home stretch
      of this competition.
      Gotta bring it, mama.
   - I'm gonna bring it hard,
              girl.
             - Okay.
     I can't wait to see it.
   - I can't wait to show you.
          - Say it with
   a little more sass, honey.
      - Girl, I cannot wait
          to show you.
           [all laugh]
    -I can't wait to see it.
             -Okay.
          -How'd I do?
 -You did great. You did great.
         She's into you.
      - All right, ladies,
          gather round.
      Gather round, ladies.
   Now, tomorrow, in addition
  to your runway presentation,
        you and your new
         sisters in drag
         need to prepare
     a lip sync performance
    to my song "Click Clack."
     [screams and laughter]
      So don't fuck it up.
         - Oh, Trinity,
        I didn't realize
      that you were serving
      some shrimp cocktail
       with your makeover.
          That's cute.
        - You worry about
     your man's feet, okay?
      You don't worry about
     our man's feet, honey.
        - One could wear,
         like, overalls,
     and then I could have,
         like, a hoodie.
   It shouldn't be that hard.
       - Nina wants to sew
 two whole outfits from scratch,
            and Nina
     don't know how to sew.
   Hey, I'm all for ambition,
     but ambition is nothing
       without execution.
        - Ah, here we go.
        Yeah, I'm having
        a hard time here.
    - Oh, I just hope we can
    execute this right, man.
       Don't curse me out.
         No, I'm sorry.
      No, I apologize, no.
     If you can just show me
   how to thread the machine,
      then I'm good, y'all.
             - Okay.
     Even though me and Nina
         had our moment,
     I still feel for Nina,
       so I'm here to help
        as much as I can.
     But I got to help Josh.
       - Let me watch this
           completely.
           - And then
      you just hit the gas,
   and it'll spin the bobbin.
         - Oh, I got it.
           Thank you.
        Okay, here we go.
     - This is the top six.
      This is not the time
      to learn how to sew,
  especially when you're having
   to make two of everything.
       - Am I even on it?
            Oh, shit.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
            - [sighs]
        Fuck, this hurts.
          - What the--
      Get the--out of here.
           - [laughs]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
          - Yes. Work.
   - I'm just gonna tighten it
         one more time.
             - Okay.
          -Oh, my God.
     -Hold on tight, Sarge.
  Our maxi challenge this week
         is to make over
    the crew of "Drag Race."
           - [groans]
         - That's great.
 You're walking like Pearl now.
         That's perfect.
         He looks stoned
      and very fashionable.
      I was a little scared
            of Duncan
      'cause he's so strict
            with us.
           But Duncan
     is feeling the fantasy.
            - Mm-hmm.
       - Oh, my goodness.
   Look at those little shoes.
   These are real drag heels.
            [laughs]
   - Oh, yeah, Sarge? Uh-huh?
 - Mommy's taking you to church
       for the first time?
        Working with him,
        it's amazing how
   I'm not in my head at all.
   I haven't had this much fun
      or felt this relaxed.
         - Whoo-hoo-hoo!
  It's like The Little Mermaid.
    -It's The Little Mermaid.
            -Exactly.
  - Except she was a big dude.
           [all laugh]
      - See, that was good.
         That was shade.
             - Okay.
           [all laugh]
          - So you got
        your foot pedal.
        - But this needs
          to come down.
         - That's, uh...
          I don't know.
       Does the foot pedal
      bring it down or no?
   - Yeah, this thing is like
      jammed or something.
     -Do you wanna ask the--
      -I can't ask anybody.
  It's like everybody's so into
   their own thing right now.
   - I don't know what to say,
          to be honest.
             We used
     all our lifelines here.
            - Right.
           - For help.
    - Now it's kind of like,
   bitch, you're on your own.
  Aaron didn't feel confident,
         and it finally
         got to a point
        where I was like,
         you know what?
     This ain't gonna work.
     It's not going to work.
      So we need to change
          our outfits.
       It's sad. I thought
 I was finally sewing something.
     - This is gonna be fun
            for you.
       - Yeah, The reason
  I particularly was doing this
           was because
    I've never really agreed
     with how we've divided
          men and women
          when it comes
        to what's strong.
         So to me, like,
    this is very encouraging
    to anyone who doesn't fit
     in that specific mold.
             -Right.
     -I know what it's like
   to kind of not particularly
       fit the jock mold.
   That to me is not what I've
  placed value of strength in.
  It's like beauty and strength
     are kind of synonymous,
           and I think
    you need to be surrounded
           by numerous
    different walks of life.
       Otherwise you just
      will never understand
         certain aspects
         of this world.
           - Exactly.
    I'm definitely surprised
     by talking with Rizzo.
      I feel the same way.
       Being a human being
         is so much more
    than being put into a box
           or a label.
      You are who you are.
             -Yeah.
            -New day.
         We have to get
    our crew members shaved,
       paint their faces,
   get them in their dresses,
     and also get ourselves
      completely into drag,
      and there is no time.
       - Nina, in the last
     previous two episodes,
 you were on the bottom, right?
            - Mm-hmm.
      - What got you there,
            you feel?
  - Um, it's been a challenge.
    - I think my vibe with it
   is what's keeping you down
          is yourself.
   That's what I get off you.
         Even yesterday,
     you talk yourself down
       almost to the point
    of jeopardizing yourself.
             -Right.
           -You know?
         No matter what,
      people are trying to
    encourage you, you know.
     It's just like one ear,
          out the other
     or your fucking pride's
         in front of you
           or you just
        too blind to see.
   - And after a while, people
     can't keep telling you,
     you know, you're great.
    Being my own worst enemy
    is like-it's a struggle.
  It is. And no matter how many
   people tell me you're good
     and we're here for you,
    I'm not gonna believe it
       until I believe it
           for myself.
      It's just...it's me.
     - Because you've always
    been this way growing up?
      - Yeah, I have just--
          I don't know.
    I've been through a lot.
           Depression
       is a serious thing.
        - Mm-hmm, I know.
         I was addicted
         to pain killers
     because I liked the way
       they made me feel.
      It just made me happy
          all the time.
             -Right.
 -Because I also get in my head
    and I get depressed and--
    But I feel more confident
          in who I am.
       When I got clean...
            - Right.
       - What does Ru say
    at the end of an episode?
         - If you can't
         love yourself?
      - Yeah, how the hell
  you gonna love anybody else?
            [laughs]
     Sue me. Right. [laughs]
        You know, people
        are on your side
        more than I think
       you think you know.
       - It's a hard thing
          to overcome,
   but with this competition,
      before it's too late,
    I really hope I can find
         the magic in me
       that I know I have
       and really just be
     a truly happier person
        so that it shows
         on the outside.
     That looks really good,
             like--
         - Yeah, look at
         the both of us.
       - So go back there,
     take off your underwear
      that you have on now,
          put those on.
             - Okay.
   - And then like I told you,
      pull everything back,
           wedgie it.
            - Right.
      - And then we'll see
   if we need a piece of tape.
           For anybody
       in my drag family,
       the number one rule
        is a fierce tuck.
     - Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
        - How's it going?
  - I don't think it--come on.
      - You ain't supposed
    to be playing tug-o-war.
      - Fuck. I mean flip.
          I mean ouch.
    - Not a wrestling match.
      You haven't even got
   to the duct tape part yet.
            -Hold on!
            -[laughs]
    Ball keeps, like, trying
to poke out more than the other.
     -We're gonna use tape.
            -Damn it!
    - We planned the costume
          around this.
      The judges know that
     I can do a fierce tuck.
      This has to be right.
        Okay, let me see.
              - Uh.
            - I mean,
      it's not great still,
        so we're gonna do
         another piece.
             - Okay.
    - [imitates tearing tape]
        - Ow! This hurts.
           What the--
      Get the--out of here!

 our hard-working crew members.
  And as an act of solidarity,
         the entire crew
  is working in wigs and heels.
              - Oh!
          Yes, queens.
          - Gentlemen,
       start your engines,

      Ladies and gentlemen,

             -Whoo!
              -Oh.
         - Glittafa Dayz
    looks like a true Taylor.
  This tuck is fucking fierce.
      - I think the store's

          - Are we sure

        Oh, it's Beyonce
          and Solange.
           - Oh, yes.
        - I am terrified.
           This runway
     is a bit of a disaster.
     But I helped my sister
         the best I can
         and get my ass
        off that runway.
      - Looks like a pump.
         - Yes, it does.
        - Alexis Michelle
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
     - Looks like Barbarella
             to me.
     - I hear they both give
         good headband.
         - Those glutes
     are made for stomping.
        [Michelle laughs]

         and I's pussies
       are defying gravity

        we have the ears,
     the teeth and the face.
       We are S&M bunnies.
        You know, fierce.
   - I can see a little hare.
             -Mm-mm.
            -Get it?
          - Yeah, yeah.
   - That's a bunny reference.

         - Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
            That hat
      is on my bucket list.

 - We're two East Coast sisters
          in the 1940s
     looking to make it big
          in Hollywood.
    I think these are really,
    really fashionable looks,
          and Dunatella
        looks beautiful.

             -Aw...

      - What label whores.
  Peppermint and Winter Green.
         -A sleeve belt.
             -Yeah.
   - I think she's got a trick
         up her sleeve.
       - Sleeve her alone.
       - We're sashaying,
        we're shantaying,
      and Ms. Winter Green,
        she's feeling it.
      I'm like, okay, girl.
       - She's sleeving on
 the Midnight Train to Georgia.

         <i> - Coming up...</i>
         - It feels like
  a Ricky's Halloween costume.
    - I need you to bring it
            at a 10.
           - It's time
        to really dig in.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
            It's time
   for the judges' critiques.
    First up, Trinity Taylor
       and Glittafa Dayz.
    - The family resemblance
        is hard to deny,
      and you did the most
     intricate choreography.
     - Yeah, so impressive.
        I can barely walk
         in those shoes,
     let alone, like, dance.
           -Glittafa.
           -Glittafa.
   - If I didn't know better,
   it'd look like you've been
    doing this for a minute.
     - But beyond, I think,
     having a great partner,
         it's about how
   you communicate and guide,
  and I think this was probably
   the tightest presentation.
     -Is that code for tuck?
         -Yes, exactly.
        - How's your tuck
           holding up?
       - The pain is real.
        The pain is real.
 - Now, what do you think you're
gonna take from this experience?
        - I'm gonna take
         this tape off.
           [all laugh]
     - Up next, Shea Coulee
     and here is Bae Coulee.
      - I love the dresses,
    like, kind of old school
         Hollywood glam.
     - But there's something
 about this attention to detail
   and about paying attention
         to your sister.
  - Bae, when she turns around,
   you could see her hairline.
         Her bra straps
    are hanging out the back.
     It felt like, you know,
     there's the star sister
        and then there's
        the other sister.
          - Oh. I hate
      that it came across,
         like, you know,
    Bae was an afterthought.
         - I think Shea
        did a great job.
   I'm proud to be her sister.
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
   - Up next, Alexis Michelle
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
    - Your brows are glitter.
     That's fucking awesome.
       - The nails scream
          I am a slut.
     - Big voluptuous slut.
        - But the outfits
     are kind of real basic.
     - It feels a little bit
         like a Ricky's
   Halloween costume in a bag.
          - Look, we're
      intergalactic whores.
     Can we have some candy,
            you know?
      Look how close we are
        to the end here.
   It's time to really dig in.
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Faye Bakker
    and Ariana Bo'nina Brown.
     - Well, I love animals,
  so I think it's really cute.
           [all laugh]
          I really do.
    - Now, was it challenging
 doing this drag transformation
           in front of
        your co-workers?
         - No. In fact,
    the teams were so sweet,
     and the art department,
      they made little tags
      that said Team Aaron,
   you know what I mean? So...
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
      - Well, we always say
  a family that drags together,
         slays together.
     - But this is kind of,
   you know, a letdown for me.
 It's you out here in a leotard
      with thigh-high boots
      and not really doing
      anything innovative.
         I was screaming
     for a little cottontail
    or a little colored glove
          or something
   just to bring this to this
         so there wasn't
     such a disconnect here.
        - And then, with
      the performance, too,
   I thought was a little bit
         underwhelming.
  - I'm so excited by what you
bring to this competition, Nina,
         but I need you
      to bring it at a 10.
     - Up next, Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
          - This looks
        so high fashion.
          It looks like
        Miu Miu on acid.
  - The proportion of the dress
          and the coat
  and all these pops of color,
   I really, really loved it.
   - Now, Dunatella, there is
   something that you're doing
        that's strangely
         turning me on.
         - I learned it
    from watching you, dear.
           [all laugh]
      - Up next, Peppermint
        and Winter Green.
            Gorgeous.
            - I know.
           [all laugh]
    - Winter Green, your face
       is just really fun
           to look at.
      You're just so funny.
        I don't know why.
  But you're, like, beautiful,
    but, like, you make me--
 but, like, you're beautiful...
           [all laugh]
       - What is it, dear?
           [all laugh]
       - Let me roll back.
        You just look...
            - Go on.
           [all laugh]
         - I just can't.
        - But the outfits
       clash so horribly,
    I don't even want to look
   at them in the same frame.
        - But guess what?
      I don't care because
    you were so fun to watch.
        - And Peppermint,
 you should thank Winter Green,
     because she was the one
     who pulled you through.
   - Now, Winter Green, do you
think you'll ever do drag again?
          - Who knows?
           Season 10?
           [all laugh]
         - "All Stars."
       Thank you, ladies.
         And to my crew
       standing on stage,
     to see you men do this,
   it says that we as a people
       are moving forward,
       and it's beautiful.
         Thank you from
     the bottom of my heart.
      Now, while you ladies
        untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
           All right.
   So just between us squirrel
   friends, what do you think?
         Trinity Taylor
       and Glittafa Dayz.
       - They had the most
    incredible choreography.
         The whole look,
         the attitudes,
         like, I bought
  everything they had to sell.
    - It was just so apparent
      that their connection
   was, like, on another level
      than anybody else's.
  - Yeah, and you know, Zaldy,
   Trinity is a real showgirl,
     so to teach her sister
          that routine
 and for her to hit it so hard,
        very impressive.
      - In those heels, Ru.
        - In those heels.
      Shea and Bae Coulee.
      - Shea kind of failed
         for me tonight.
    She let her sister down.
      - In Shea's defense,
    I felt like she did come
       to her sister's aid
    when she saw the problems
            going on.
          And I thought
      she looked beautiful.
      - Shea has wowed us.
   Tonight, that was not wow.
  - But is what Shea did reason
enough to put her in the bottom?
          -Not for me.
       -To me, yes, 100%.
          -Not for you?
              -No.
   - Not to me. I didn't think
     her look was the worst.
I didn't think their performance
         was the worst.
       I would put Alexis.
            - Not me.
    - That's who I would put
         in the bottom.
          - All right.
     Let's talk about Alexis
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
        - Something about
      how unfresh this was.
     It was hard for me to,
     like, really enjoy it.
       - Though it was not
        my favorite look,
       it was meticulously
          put together.
      - But I was at least
    a little more interested
          in what Shea
      brought to the table
     than I was with Alexis.
            - Really?
       Shea's was sloppy.
    This one was not sloppy.
             - Well,
     Michelle knows sloppy.
           [all laugh]
      - I feel like Alexis
          and Rye Anne,
     even if you don't like
         the aesthetic,
but I do find them more original
     than just frumpy gowns.
      - Thank you. Tonight,
   toilet paper, paper towel.
      - [laughs] All right.
So let's move on to Nina Bo'nina
  Brown Tyler Moore and Ariana.
   - That bunny had absolutely
  no connection with the rest.
     And we've been getting
       the same silhouette
         with a bodysuit
      and thigh-high boots.
        I'm done with it.
             - Yeah.
       Even the bunny part
   was just sort of half done.
     - And, like, the ears,
         it looked like
     they'd been rained on.
   - It's more arts and crafts
      than it is Comic-Con.
         - Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
       - I really enjoyed
         the connection
    between the two of them.
        And are her looks
    always so modern-feeling?
      - She's very fashion.
            - Because
    it really worked for me.
    - She's been so serious,
       but she looked like
         she was really
   enjoying herself this week.
       -Really letting go.
             -Yeah.
        - I'm super proud
        of Sasha tonight.
          - Peppermint
        and Winter Green.
   - I think we can all agree
             tonight
        that Winter Green
          gets the MVP.
           [all laugh]
       She's a superstar.
         From the minute
       she came out here,
          I bought it.
  The only think I did not buy
       was those outfits.
      - So hard to look at.
 Just the choice in the fabrics,
     they felt so disparate.
 - Peppermint better be kissing
      Winter Green's feet.
             Because
     if it weren't for her,
     I could see Peppermint
    in the bottom this week.
      - All right, silence.
   You've been no help at all.
           [all laugh]
      Bring back my girls.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
    Peppermint, you're safe.
         Trinity Taylor,
   you gave us Glittafa Dayz,
         months, years.
           - [laughs]
      - Con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
        -Congratulations.
          -Oh, my God.
          - You've won
        two custom gowns
 from celebrity fashion designer
         David Meister.
          - Thank you.
     - And your drag sister
             has won
    a $2,000 gift certificate
   to Klein, Epstein & Parker,
     suits made to measure.
             - What?
         - You may step
    to the back of the stage.
      - Thank you so much.
         - Sasha Velour,
          you're safe.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        your bunny looks
 did not make the judges hoppy.
       I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you are up for elimination.
        Alexis Michelle,
  your Barbarellas were basic.
   Shea Coulee, your makeover
      of Bae was not okay.
        - Come on, Shea,
 come on, Shea, come on, Shaea.
       Alexis Michelle...
          You're safe.
     - Thank you very much.
            - Oh, no.
         - Shea Coulee,
       I'm sorry, my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
       - To see the judges
          looking at me
     as if I let them down,
           I'm scared.
     - Ladies, this is your
    last chance to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
         - I almost want
     to just stand on stage
         and just point
    and do a Charlie number,
     but I'm also thinking,
         you know what?
          This is what
        I signed up for,
         so here we go.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.

      Join the other girls.
      - Thank you so much.
           Thank you.

         Andre Charles,
       baby, you are part
        of my family now.
        Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
             Sue me.
           [all laugh]
       - I think I might.
           [all laugh]
- I was trying to be a voice for
 the African American community
    who think all they can do
  is just do one type of drag,
    but I guess I just wasn't
     strong enough mentally.
 - You fucking changed my life.
   You're part of the family.
   Give me a hug and then get
      the fuck out of here.
  - Yeah, this thing is heavy.
        - No, no, no, no.
     I know, I know, I know.

        <i> - Previously on</i>
    <i> "RuPaul's Drag Race..."</i>
  - There's always been tension
       with me and Eureka.
     Maybe she has an issue
          with the fact
       that every pageant
       that we've been in,
           I beat her.
      - You need to create
       a totally original
       fairytale princess
       and sassy sidekick.
         Trinity Taylor.
      - This is really fun,
     and then you showed us
         your starfish.
          - Itch cream.
         [RuPaul laughs]
             - Aja.
   - I am Princess Disastah's
          smoke cloud.
    - I literally had no clue
   what was going on tonight.
        I also think that
    your makeup is very dark.
         - Kimora Blac.
    - My name is Funky Monkey
      from Banana Kingdom.
  - Trinity Taylor, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.
     Aja, shantay, you stay.
    Kimora Blac, sashay away.
         - Yes! Finally!
          - Oh, Kimore.
       - Oh, Kimora's gone
        and I am so sad.
  - How do you feel after that
  lip sync for your life, baby?
       - I just feel like
       I walked into here
          thinking like
       I was unstoppable,
       and now I feel like
  I really need to reevaluate.
    - For Aja, the challenge
         is going to be
       not becoming bitter
    because she sees herself
         as a superstar.
         And to be told
       your makeup is off,
your outfit isn't great is a bit
    of an ego check for her.
          - So Trinity,
     last week when you said
      that you were coming
      for Valentina's spot,
  how does it feel to be coming
      for Valentina's spot?
             -Uh-oh.
              -Ooh!
            - Shade.
         - Well, as long
      as we're being real,
     I don't think Valentina
    should've been top three.
          - Valentina,
    you know I live for you,
       but I think it was
   a little misjudged tonight.
   - These girls can continue
        to talk about me.
     They're not the judges.
        I'm ready to be,
         like, hmm, hmm.
       Whew. I'm focused.
        - Shea, I can't.
   - Bitch, I wore four items.
         I wore a panty,
       a chap and a coat.
           - Valentina
     came down the runway--
     I'm talking about you,
             bitch--
          In a leotard.
     I just don't understand
    the hype about Valentina.
     Listening to the judges
     critiques, I felt ugly.
 To hear someone constantly get
  praised for just being pretty
         when I'm trying
          to compensate
  with everything else I have,
            it sucks.
     People always undermine
            my drag.
    But you know what, girl?
    I think that I'm amazing.
       That there's people
     who think I'm amazing.
         I deserve to be
      in this competition.
       - Aja's true colors
         are coming out.
      She presents herself
as this person that's confident,
        but there's a lot
      of insecurity there.
       - I'm going to win
  next challenge, mark my word.
  Coming for you, Ms. Trinity!

          - Hi, hi-hi.
        Aah! [all laugh]
            - I pass
     the third episode. Yes!
     You know, three is not
 my lucky number from Season 8.
             Ha-ha!
     - Hello, hello, hello!
           [cheering]
      Now, when most of you
     are just crawling home
   from being up in the club,
     "Good Morning America"
      and the "Today" show
    are ruling the airwaves.
      Now it's your chance
      to join the cutthroat
     morning talk show wars.
              -Ooh.
          -Oh, my God!
      - You'll be cohosting
    two rival morning shows.
          - Oh, my God.
       - #MorningBitches.
      [cheers and laughter]
      Now, Trinity, you won
      last week's challenge
      and Aja, you survived
          the lip sync,
           so you two
       are team captains.
              -Oh!
              -Yes!
        - Now, remember,
     in morning television,
    chemistry is everything.
   So pick your morning teams,
       starting with Aja.
          - Valentina.
  Even though I'm still giving
     Valentina the side eye,
       I am really curious
   what the judges see in her
        and maybe be able
   to channel that in myself.
            -Trinity.
          -Peppermint.
           [applause]
         - Slay Coulee.
           - Charlie.
         - Sasha Velour.
           - Ms. Cucu.
 - Whoopi Goldberg is not ready
      for her replacement.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
            -Eureka!
              -Aah!
 - Outside of this competition,
    Eureka and I have a very
    up and down relationship,
       but I picked Eureka
         because I know
     she's gonna work hard,
      and I want to show Ru
         that I can work
          with anybody.
    - That leaves Farrah Moan
     and Nina Bo'nina Brown.
       - I'm going to say
          Farrah Moan.
        We needed a fish.
       - Which means Nina
       is on Team Trinity.
       - Come here, girl.
   - Team Aja, you're the host
   of "Good Morning Bitches."
    And Team Trinity, you're
   the host of "Not On Today."
             - Yeah!
         - Oh, and just
         one more thing.
    Your show is going to be
         broadcast live.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines
   and may the best woman win.
       - #TeamNotOnToday.
   - Nina, do not let the fact
    that you were picked last
          in your head
        because I'm glad
    that you're on our team.
             - Okay.
      But at the same time,
        if you're, like,
    saying that we love you,
          when we have
        to choose groups,
   why would you run past me?
    I think the other queens
   see me as a Debbie Downer,
            the girl
      who gets in her head.
    But I can't just pretend
        when I'm over it.
   I kind of wear my emotions
          on my sleeve.
       - So Team Captain,
    is our television station
        set in the South?
         - There's three
      Southern Belles here.
   - But "Not On Today" I feel
     like is kind of ghetto.
    Do you think we should do
         ghetto accent?
            - No, no.
      - I think the biggest
      challenge for Trinity
     is going to be keeping
        everybody in line
        'cause she's got
     some big personalities.
          Let's just--
  She's got Eureka on the team.
            [laughs]
  And it may be kind of tough.
         - Ghetto fierce
       like, not on today.
     - This--okay, so first
    of all, as Team Captain,
      I don't want anybody
    to talk over each other.
       So raise your hand
       and let the person
         that's talking
   finish what they're saying.
            - Ha-ha.
      Here it comes, girl.
            Step one
     of competitive Trinity.
    - Also, I think we would
   have really good chemistry
        so we're gonna be
        the news anchors.
             - Okay.
     - Then, because you're
 really good at building stuff,
       you're really gonna
       be good at the DIY.
       And then, y'all are
    definitely entertainment.
      - We don't talk about
  who wants to play what role.
        Trinity is, like,
     you're doing this role,
     you're doing this role.
 So, to me, it wasn't a leader,
       it was a dictator.
       - When Ru was like
         "Not On Today,"
        it did give that,
      like, tinge of shade.
      - Okay, I'm so sorry.
         - God, please.
     This is typical Eureka.
  - You know, something shady.
     - Maybe we each could--
           - Maybe not
       towards each other.
          - This is me
       holding my hand up
     and following the rules
      that we set in place.
 If you're gonna set the rules,
        follow the rules.
   - Eureka needs to shut up.
        I'm trying to be
      a good Southern Belle
    and not punch this bitch
          in the face.
      - So all three of us
 just need to have our own vibe.
         You all need...
      - If y'all want to be
       that ghetto--yeah.
      - We're over-talking
      each other, remember?
           - [squawks]
         - What I think
        we should do now
            is break
      in our smaller groups
    and then we'll reconvene
  after we go over everything.
          - Yes, Miss.
     - Eureka wants it to be
        the Eureka Show,
    but that's not happening.
        Girl, no, ma'am.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Live in three, two...
           - First up,
     we have Raja and Raven.
         - Let's move on
      to the next one--oh.
       - And next, we have
       Coco Montrese and--
             - Next!

         [RuPaul laughs]
    - We're going to give you
            the scoop
      about Justin Bieber's
      shocking new sex tape
     with Dame Maggie Smith.
     The challenge this week
     is to cohost two rival
       morning chat shows.
   With my experience working
    with "Live," I'm excited.
     But also, I don't want
        to be just known
 as that guy that does Madonna,
       Cher and Lady Gaga.
   I'd like to be known for me
    because there's only one
   Charlie Hides in the world.
           Google it.
    - Trust me, you are going
         to watch this.
         - You're going
      to want to see this.
      - Okay. You're want--
          You're going
     to wanted to see this.
        - You're going--
        You are going...
    - Trust me. You are going
      to want to see this.
     - Cynthia has sometimes
      a haphazard approach.
        And with comedy,
    if you add an extra word,
     you can blow the joke.
           If you drop
       a couple of words,
     you can blow the joke.
    - Trust me, you are going
      to want to see this.
      - And just say want.
             - Want.
     - You're going to want
          to see this.
    - Okay. Trust me, you are
   going to want to see this.
         - You're going
      to want to see this.
    - Want to see this, okay.
             - Yeah.
             - Okay.
  - Yeah. But with a big smile.
    - Charlie's very strict.
    She's trying to correct,
  like, all the pronunciation,
     and I appreciate that.
      But that's what made
       my character funny,
   when I just pronounce words
     that are mispronounced.
    I'm Cynthia Lee Martinez
       Valles de la Flores
   filla de Orlando Fontaine.
    - But we call her Maria.
      - [chuckles] Charlie.
         - I wouldn't--
   I don't know if I'd laugh.
         - Aye dios mio.
    - Trust me, the laughing
    is going to be dead air.
     - Part of the challenge
     is to show personality,
    like how to be yourself.
  And Charlie, in certain way,
  is blocking me to be myself.
          - Just smile,
        just like, like,
    like I want to knife you.
     - Don't try to make me
     something that I'm not
     because that's gonna be
           a disaster.
             -Yeah?
              -Yes.
            - Hello.
      - It's time to shoot
    our rival morning shows.
     "Good Morning Bitches."
 - Welcome to your beautiful set
    furnished by 204 Events.
       Isn't is gorgeous?
           -Gorgeous!
              -Yes.
         - This is live.
     There are no take twos.
      Embrace the mistakes
 because some of the best magic
     comes out of the stuff
        that went wrong.
           All right.
  Take your place at the table.
       We're almost live.
        And we are ready
     in five, four, three...
    - Good morning, bitches.
    It's the top of the hour
 and time for today's headlines.
          - The world's
      hottest fashion trend
           is acrylic
       toenail extensions.
           - Oh, dear.
      - I actually just got
      mine done yesterday.
            - Oh, my!
      I may have to give it
    another thought, Farrah.
     - You won't regret it,
             Alexis.
      -I'll drink to that.
            -Cheers.
          - [chuckles]
      - All right. We're in
   commercials. Let's move on.
   Enter-taint-ment reporters,
        take your places.
- I don't really know where mine
 and Aja's relationship stands,
        but I have to do
       the best that I can
       to connect with her
         at this moment.
     - Live in three, two...
     -Good morning, bitches.
     -Good morning, bitches.
        - The latest meme
    taking over the internet
         is drag queens
   without eyebrows or teeth.
          -Oh, my God.
        -Can you imagine?
            First up,
     we have Raja and Raven.
             -Next.
             -Next.
         - Let's move on
      to the next one--oh.
    - And next, we have Coco
  Montrese and Alyssa Edwards.
      - You sure--I thought
   that was Laganja Estranja.
          - Oh, my God!
        - The resemblance
        is uncanny, girl.
             - True.
             - Next!
       - And we're clear.
        Commercial, guys.
   - [imitates bomb dropping]
       They have chemistry
           all right,
    but sometimes things can
   combust in a chemistry lab.
    You know what I'm saying?
          - Here we go.
    Coming out of commercial.
      DIY, you're next. Go!
       - Today, I'm going
       to be teaching you
    how to work in a RuPaul's
  chocolate bar into your diet.
    - I feel like people just
   don't eat enough chocolate.
      - You know, I agree.
    I love eating chocolate.
             -Sasha!
            -[laughs]
  - Do you have a solution for
 people who love to eat dessert,
        but hate waiting
    till the end of the meal?
         - Why not take
    a RuPaul's chocolate bar
     and put it in a salad?
     -Yeah, toss that salad.
          -Stir it up.
      You want to try some?
  - I thought you'd never ask.
       - Do you like that?
            - Mm-hmm.
               No.
             Sasha?
            -Uh-huh.
     - For queens that love
    the gym--for queens--mm.
            -[laughs]
   -Tastes great, doesn't it?
          -Oh, so good.
            -[laughs]
    - Sasha and I are really
     leaning on each other.
        We're having fun.
     The jokes are landing.
         It feels right.
          - So you take
   a RuPaul's chocolate bar...
       - Get out of town.
        - And you hide it
     in a stalk of broccoli.
    - You're just a magician.
           - [laughs]
       - It's a chocolate
           revolution.
     - And we're clear. Cut!
           [all laugh]
        Chew and swallow.
           All right.
     Reset for the celebrity
      interview. Let's go.
         - How are you?
             -Hello.
              -Hi!
    - When I see Naya Rivera,
         I'm like, yes!
          Come through.
      She was always one of
     my favorites on "Glee."
   - Are you ready to go live?
       In three, two, go!
        - Please welcome
       our special guest,
       actress and singer
          Naya Rivera.
       Good morning, Naya!
  - Hi, good morning, bitches.
           [all laugh]
    - Well, Naya, what advice
         would you have
          for a starlet
   who's trying to stick out.
     - When I first started
           on "Glee,"
         I didn't have,
        like, any lines,
       so I would just sit
  in the back of that classroom
     and, like, roll my neck
     and do anything I could
    to get that camera on me.
         And it worked.
        - Congratulations
        on your new book.
        "Sorry Not Sorry"
      is an amazing title.
    Where did that come from?
    - The book is all about,
            you know,
   learning from your mistakes
         and being sorry
        about some things
          and not sorry
    about some other things.
           -Same here.
             -Right?
     - So, Naya, what advice
           do you have
   to young aspiring actresses
    who want to make a career
          in show biz.
  - Find something else to do.
           [all laugh]
          - Well, Naya,
   we cannot thank you enough
    for being with us today.
    -Thank you for having me.
      -It was so much fun.
   - We'll be sure to see you
     tomorrow morning for...
    -"Good Morning Bitches."
    -"Good Morning Bitches."
        -And we're clear.
    -Best show on television.
           [all laugh]
         -<i> Coming up...</i>
         - I don't want
        any extra breast
       other than--unless
    they come with, uh, two--
    two biscuits--two breasts
        and two biscuits.
         - I'm confused.
     Peppermint's confused.
   We're all fucking confused.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - It's time for my team
   "Not On Today" to go live.
          - Get ready!
   Five, four, three, two, go!
         - Good morning.
    It's time for the biggest
       stories of the day.
          - The Center
     for Infectious Diseases
 has announced there's something
       in your makeup bag
    that could be killing you
           right now.
  - I wonder what it could be?
 - I don't know, but whatever's
       in your makeup bag,
    you should throw it away.
 - That's okay, because I'm sure
whatever I have in my makeup bag
    would certainly kill you.
     Uh, like your husband's
         business card.
         - [fake laugh]
         - And in health
        and science news,
  all of Michelle Visage's fans
       have come together
            to create
     a crowdfunding campaign
         to pay for her
    breast reduction surgery.
     You know, I don't want
        any extra breast
       other than--unless
    they come with, uh, two--
    two biscuits--two breasts
        and two biscuits.
             Jesus.
            - Now for
   the enter-taint-ment report
       with Charlie Hides
    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
         - Good morning.
      Today, we're talking
          social media.
  There's a fun new game people
   are playing on the internet
     called #SophiesChoices.
    I give you two scenarios.
      You tell me which one
    of the two you'd choose.
   You have to lick ice cream
       off Nick Jonas' abs
        or eat fudge off
    Chris Hemsworth's chest.
  - Let me tell you something.
     I'm intolerant lactose.
       I don't mind to go
   all the way to the hospital
        just only to eat
       that banana split.
           - [laughs]
          - Do you have
       a question for me?
   -I got a question for you.
             -Good.
    - You get one night with
   Justin Bieber totally naked
        or one night with
     Justin Bieber's money.
      - So I would probably
       have sex with him,
      have a hidden camera,
    send the pictures to TMZ
    and then keep the money.
   - I'm gonna keep the money
             because
     I don't know if Justin
       had the opportunity
      to deal with my cucu.
        It's time for...
    -Who Done Wore It Better.
    -Who Done Wore It Better.
     - Detox, the drag queen
     or Detox, the pussycat?
   - The cat looks incredible.
           - [laughs]
        - I'm looking at
    Detox the pussycat's hair
    and it looks a little bit
       like Winifred from
      "Hocus Post--Pocus"?
   - Charlie, what's going on?
   He is cold as a dead body.
   He's so tense, so nervous.
            - I think
     we're gonna earn favor
         of our--one of
    our favorite drag queens,
  Bob--uh, sorry, Thorgy Thor.
           Shantay...
           -You stay!
           -You stay!
         - And finally--
    well, that's about all--
    that's about all the time
     we have for right now.
     - Don't touch the dial!
        - Don't touch me.
       - And we're clear.
        Commercial, guys.
           We're live
       in three, two, go.
         - Welcome back.
    It's eight past the hour.
 - Eureka and Nina Bo-nina Brown
            are here
        to give us some--
        give us some tips
  on how to do drag on a dime.
       - All right, Nina.
   Now, this lace right here,
     it is 100% human hair,
      but it costs $7,300.
      - Girl, what you need
        to do is, honey,
   get your platinum EBT card,
              girl.
             - Okay.
        - And go on down
   to the Dollar Store, girl,
      and get you a lavish
     ramen noodle wig, girl.
    - Oh. Is it beef flavor?
     - Ooh, chicken, bitch.
      Goes for a mere price
            of $6.00.
       - Oh, it looks good
     and tastes good, girl.
              -Hey.
             -Okay.
       Now, let's move on.
         We've got these
     ass cheek pads, honey.
      Gel. Per cheek, $200.
        - Girl, a cheek.
         You're doing it
        all wrong, mama.
       Get this ham, girl.
       For the mere price
        of $8.00, honey.
         - $8.00, bitch.
       - And stuff her up.
             Oh, oh!
       - Well, all right.
     Oh, she's edible, too.
    She look good and she...
       -Tastes good, girl.
       -Tastes good, girl.
       - Great, and we're
         in commercial.
         We're moving on
   to the celebrity interview.
          - Me and Nina
       fucking killed it.
         The ham's good.
    Can I have another piece?
       - We're coming back
        in three, two...
        - Please welcome
     our very special guest,
       actress and singer
          Naya Rivera.
    Are you happy to be here?
      - Hi. "Not On Today."
           [all laugh]
    - Now, I heard somewhere
     that when you were 19,
     you lied on your resume
          to get a job
     at Abercrombie & Fitch?
           -I did. I--
 -Did you fudge the truth at all
       to get onto "Glee"?
    - No. I had to actually--
      I had to sing and act
          for that one.
 - What's the name of your book
   and when is it coming out?
          - It's called
        "Sorry Not Sorry:
        Dreams, Mistakes
         and Growing Up"
        and it comes out
         September 13th.
         - I'm thinking
   that Trinity and Peppermint
      are not noticing that
    it's time to wrap it up.
     - My publishers and I,
 we just kind of really loved it
   and thought it was clever.
       - It's not my job.
       I'm not the anchor,
but I'm just thinking Joy Behar,
       what would she do?
   - I can't wait to read it.
       - Thanks very much
         for joining us.
            It's time
      to go to commercial.
       - Do I get up now?
         - I'm confused.
     Peppermint's confused.
   We're all fucking confused.
         - Am I leaving?
             - Okay.
       All right, ladies,
       we're off the air,
    but nobody said goodbye.
    - This is definitely bad.
         Bad, bad, bad.
    That's all I'm thinking,
              bad.
         -<i> Coming up...</i>
  - You're making a really bad
    first impression with me.
          - Why are you
     talking over me, girl?
        - I can hear you
        talking about me.
      - Because I'm upset.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     -Good morning bitches.
     -Good morning bitches.
     - It's elimination day
      and our runway today
      is naughty nighties.
   - How are you doing, girl?
           - I'm okay.
  I just don't want to go home.
             -Right.
        -Me and Valentina
      didn't have chemistry
        in the challenge,
      and it makes me feel
         really nervous
     because I just came off
           the bottom.
  I think it's going to affect
     how the judges see me.
      You know me, Alexis.
             - Yeah.
           - You know
      what I'm capable of.
     Like, it's not my 100%.
     - It's really hard when
  you're in a pressure cooker.
       - But I don't feel
    like I'm under pressure.
          I feel maybe
       I'm overconfident.
    - Aja, I'm not gonna lie.
          You're, like,
      oftentimes negative.
   You're making a really bad
    first impression with me
     because I can hear you
in the corners talking about me.
   Maybe some advice is that,
    like, don't focus on me.
   Don't focus on other girls.
        Focus in on you.
       - I just feel like
 I've been such a disappointment
      while I've been here,
        and I took it out
     in all the wrong ways.
         - All we can do
         moving forward
         is to be kinder
    to each other, you know?
        - Yeah, I agree.
       I really genuinely
         like Valentina.
   I'm just really frustrated
        because I really
        want this so bad,
         and I feel like
         I'm fucked up.
  You're a really good person.
        I'm really sorry.
           - I accept
       your apology, babe.
       Just let me finish
         doing my makeup
   'cause it's more important.
              -Aah!
            -[laughs]
    - Tell me about the work
         you were doing
      from HIV prevention.
  - I do referrals for clients
         who--they were
    newly diagnosed with HIV.
     - And it's so important
        that people know.
   I'm of the era when people
  would be spreading the virus
       before we even knew
         it had a name.
     I came out just before
       AIDS became known.
      So none of my friends
       were playing safe.
  I buried all my best friends,
    most of my best friends,
      and...that's probably
       the hardest thing.
            Sometimes
    I have survivor's guilt.
     Like why did I survive?
    It was a death sentence.
    I've seen so many smart,
   beautiful, talented people
   go the route of the pills,
       drugs, the bottle.
    Society was telling them
    they are not good enough.
         The one message
       I try to get across
   is you're worth it, you're
   special, you're beautiful.
        And you're worth
    taking care of yourself.
            [sobbing]
    So you gotta stay strong,
       and you gotta rely
        on your friends.
     - Thank you for sharing
           that story.
   Because of your generation,
   we appreciate what we have.
        - It's important
          to not forget
          what happened
  in the eighties and nineties
     during the AIDS crisis
          and how many
        brilliant voices
  in the world of art and drag
          we could have
      without those losses.
   - My makeup is going to be
  fucking ruined on the runway.
     - Do a smoky eye, girl.
           - [laughs]
     - Does anyone here have
      psoriasis or just me?
       - I have bad acne.
   - I have really bad breath
         in the morning.
             - Eew.
   - Can I tell you guys about
one of the disorders that I have
    that I'm struggling with?
            - Eating.
    - Don't joke about that.
             Eureka,
    it's really inappropriate
       to joke about that.
    - Sasha, okay, I realize,
         but why push it
     straight to negativity?
- I don't think she's pushing it
     straight to negativity.
  I think that she's trying to
   keep the levels respectful.
     - By trying to make me
     look like a bad person?
        - I have nothing
          against you,
    but I have a long history
     with eating disorders.
       You don't know now
       by looking at me--
   - There are other types of
   eating disorders besides--
       - But so many times
          in my life--
       Why are you talking
         over me, girl?
      - Because I'm upset.
     I make the joke to try
     to make the air light.
         I'm not trying
         to be malicious
     and I'm all of a sudden
       not a good person.
 - Can I tell you how many times
    people have looked at me
   and been like, oh, my God,
        you're anorexic.
      It's really hurtful.
         - I never come
        at any of you all
       with a nasty tone,
           so when I--
     - I really didn't think
       I was being nasty.
    - Let me finish, please.
    But you had a nasty tone,
    and that's what upset me
            about it.
  - Look, I'm coming over here
     because if it came off
          as an attack,
      I do truly apologize.
    I would never want that.
       I am just trying--
  - Well, I apologize that you
  were offended by what I said.
           - I wasn't.
  - You obviously were offended
     at what I said, right?
        What do you want
         from me, girl?
         Do you want me
     to get down on my knees
   and beg you to forgive me?
         - Girl, please.
    - I think I want you guys
    to focus on getting ready
         for the runway.
             'Cause
     it's going in circles.
             [sighs]

            And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
    Good morn-ting, Michelle.
      Girl, did you wake up
           like that?
           - Actually,
     can I have five minutes
           so I can go
       put some makeup on?
          - You should.
           [all laugh]
        And the hilarious
          Ross Mathews.
     Now, would you wake up
         with my girls?
       - Morning, would I?
       - From the TV show,
            "Unreal,"
      "Drag Race" superfan
     Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman.
         Are you hungry?
     - Positively ravenous.
           [all laugh]
       - And the beautiful
    and talented Naya Rivera.
    - This is truly the most
     magical of experiences.
   - Well, make sure you still
      have your pocketbook.
              - Oh.
          - This week,
    we challenged our queens
   to rise and shine on their
   very own morning talk show.
   And tonight, they're gonna
    sleepwalk down the runway
   in their naughty nighties.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
   Category is...Farrah Moan.
        Alexis Michelle.
              Aja.
           Valentina.
          Shea Coulee.
          Sasha Velour.

           Peppermint.

      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
             Eureka.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Joyner-Kersee.
   Now, she's reminding me to
   always use my night cream.
        [Michelle laughs]
          <i> Coming up...</i>
     Who deserves to go home
        tonight and why?
            - [sobs]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
        Welcome, ladies.
        The judges and I
   watched your morning shows
          and I've made
         some decisions.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
          Shea Coulee.
          Sasha Velour.
            Ladies...
       Con-drag-ulations.
    You are both the winners
    of this week's challenge.
        - It feels great
        to win with Sasha
  because I really feel myself
           developing
     a friendship with her.
    - You've each won $1,000
 and a year's supply of burgers
     from Hamburger Mary's,
    where you can eat, drink
       and be merry, Mary.
           [all laugh]
  Team "Good Morning Bitches,"
        you're all safe.
           [applause]
    You may leave the stage.
           That means
      Team "Not On Today,"
          you're all up
        for elimination.
            It's time
   for the judges' critiques,
            starting
      with Trinity Taylor.
  - I think you look stunning.
     I'm incredibly jealous
          of your ass.
     - But your performance
        in the challenge,
     it seemed very uptight,
            very mean
        and I don't think
     anybody wants to watch
     anybody bitchy and mean
         in the morning.
         - The storyline
       that we went with,
   she slept with my husband,
    and so there was all this
      underlining despise.
      - On a morning show,
    it has to be a little bit
       more light-hearted.
If I were flipping the channels,
     I would keep flipping.
          - Peppermint.
          - Your makeup
       does look gorgeous.
         I do, however,
        hate the outfit.
   I think that you could have
 put a lot more effort into it.
            - I think
      it's a little short,
    so when you turn around,
    like, we're seeing stuff.
      - Though you fumbled
     the ball a few times...
  - A breast and two biscuits.
   - I thought your character
         was fun-loving.
          I don't know
        whose job it was
          to, I guess,
    excuse me from the table
     so that, as the guest,
   I knew that I could leave.
    I don't know who dropped
      the ball on that one.
   - Can I take responsibility
            for that?
     I was a little confused
           at the end.
             - Okay.
   - I'll take responsibility
          for it, too.
           I'm sorry,
    I don't want you to think
      that you were, like,
        an afterthought.
    - No, no, no, not at all.
        But you could get
        some real bitches
       that would take it
         personal, so...
      - Dame Charlie Hides.
   - I love the look tonight.
          I was worried
    you were gonna fall over.
   Those are some high heels.
      -They are very high.
           -Very high.
      - But what I noticed
     about your performance
         is that you are
        a control freak.
       You were so married
         to those cards.
   Cynthia didn't even finish
            her line
     and you already, like,
        look, look, look.
        And when you were
       interviewing Naya,
      when you ask somebody
           a question,
            you need
     to let them answer it.
     - It felt like you were
      stepping on her lines
     and the timing was off.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   - To me, this does not read
           as nightie,
   but what I loved about you
        in the challenge
   was that even when Charlie
    was trying to direct you
     in her controlling way,
         you were funny
  and you messed the words up.
            You were
    intolerant lactose and...
            -[laughs]
        -You are a star.
   I really think that you've,
    like, come into your own.
        Really well done.
          - Thank you.
            - Eureka.
   - Again, this doesn't read
         nightie to me.
     This reads dominatrix.
   It's so funny how this end
        is really nightie
  and that end is just whores.
           - [laughs]
   - Well, surprise, surprise,
    I disagree with Michelle.
  You're clearly going to bed.
        You're just doing
        different things
   on that side of the runway.
            - You two
   were my favorite to watch.
   Chemistry is not something
          you can buy.
       That's why this one
      has me around still.
           - [laughs]
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Rodham Clinton.
           [all laugh]
          - [sniffling]
   I'm gonna probably be like
   the cry baby of the season.
        -It's okay, mama.
           -I'm sorry.
      I'm just so grateful
           to be here.
        [sobs] I'm happy.
          - Well, Nina,
   if those are tears of joy,
       I'd hate to see you
       when you're upset.
           [all laugh]
       We love you, girl.
   Let's go to the critiques.
   - Again, it doesn't scream
         nightie to me.
           It screams
      streetwalking whore.
         And I love it!
       - In the talk show,
       you were serving me
   the Lady Chablis realness.
    The painted on spit curl
          was just like
       the cherry on top.
     - But you're gonna need
         a thicker skin
         to get through
        this competition.
         I so appreciate
     what this means to you.
   I just want you to be ready
          for how tough
       this is gonna get.
    - You all worked so hard
       on this challenge,
        but I have to ask
          one question.
     Who deserves to go home
        tonight and why?
         Trinity Taylor.
   - Just from your critique,
      it would be Charlie.
          - Peppermint,
         same question.
    - Based on the critiques,
            Charlie.
        - Charlie Hides.
  - Peppermint's look is a bit
   more basic, so Peppermint.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
    - Because I believe she's
   a strong competition for me
       and her total look,
           Peppermint.
      - All right, Eureka,
           you're up.
     - I would say Trinity.
           I feel like
       the ending wrap-up
         might have been
    a little more controlled
    if we worked as a group.
      And I also felt like
   she was focused on herself
     and not really so much
        of everyone else.
         - I call shade.
    I take responsibility for
   the things that I did wrong
    and if that's the reason
      why I should go home,
       then I understand.
     But don't tell me that
 I didn't do my job as a leader,
         because I did.
    And I included everybody,
     including you, Eureka.
       - Well, I was asked
       my honest opinion,
  and that's my honest opinion
     and I stand beside it.
       - All right. Nina.
       - Trinity, because
      she was the captain.
      But she did her job.
 It's just that we didn't really
  feel a part of it sometimes.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   Thank you for your honesty.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
           All right.
 Well, just between us squirrel
   friends, what do you think?
         Let's start off
      with Trinity Taylor.
  - Her morning talk show host,
      I just didn't get it.
        - I think Trinity
        really tripped up
          with that gag
         they were doing
   because it didn't allow her
    to be her charming self.
           Peppermint.
       - My first thought
            was that
   it seemed like a rehearsal.
   - For me, it was more about
       her outfit tonight.
     - The black lace shirt
  with a pink wrinkled nightie,
    it just was a whole bunch
           of a mess.
    But I liked her better of
 the two in the anchor position.
        - Charlie Hides.
           - The walk
     on the runway tonight,
   she seemed tired or bored.
    She just wasn't shining.
   - She was my least favorite
        in the challenge.
   - My notes next to her name
    say dead behind the eyes.
            Gave up.
           - [laughs]
     - I'm just disappointed
  that a seasoned vet like that
       doesn't understand
          how TV works.
        She didn't allow
      the moment to happen.
   In fact, it almost impeded
  on Cynthia Lee's performance.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
  - She was so fierce tonight.
   She was giving, like, X-Men
   weird angel/devil realness.
       - In her challenge,
      she was so much fun.
           I couldn't
       stop watching her.
  Dare I say that we are crazy
         for cucu puffs?
           [all laugh]
            -Eureka.
    -I liked her immediately.
  She was funny, she was real,
       she was believable.
       - If I see a poster
       for Eureka's show,
       I'm buying a ticket
       and I'm showing up.
          - When I find
       where her show is,
   do you want to go with me?
          - Girl, yes.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Bowyer-Chapman.
           - [laughs]
    Walking down the runway,
       she was incredible
      and in the challenge,
        she was on fire.
     - But the vulnerability
           is so raw,
     I just worry about her.
         - This industry
    can be quite challenging,
  and you can't show up to work
        crying every day.
      - All right. Silence.
     I've made my decision.

          - You got it

   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine...
          you're safe.
          - Thank you.
        - Trinity Taylor,
      as a morning anchor,
   you nearly sank your team.
       I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you are up for elimination.
             - Okay.
            - Eureka,
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        you're both safe.
          - Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
           Peppermint.
      You're a good sport,
         but this week,
      you fumbled the ball.
         Charlie Hides,
    you are one fierce queen,
     but this week, you put
 the ain't in enter-taint-ment.
       I'm sorry, Charlie,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
           Peppermint,
      join the other girls.
          - Thank you.
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life!
       - This is my chance
     to show the other girls
  that if you go up against me
         in a lip sync,
      you better bring it,
        because I'm going
   to send these bitches home.
         I want to win.
          I don't care
        if we're friends.
           - Good luck
      and don't fuck it up.

     - Happy 90th birthday,

          [all laugh]
    - Michelle Visage judges
     a talent competition.
    I don't know about you,
     but don't you actually
have to have talent to do that?
             Ha...
         - Farrah Moan.
    - Nothing landed, honey.
       - Alexis Michelle.
   - It's a Hanukkah miracle.
         Baruch HaShem.
      - I literally forget
  there was an audience here.
  That's how silent they were.
         - My question
     the whole entire time
      is why is she green?
    - Well, Tamar, have you
     ever watched the show?
- Peppermint, you're the winner
   of this week's challenge.

        Alexis Michelle,
       shantay you stay.

          -Oh, Farrah.
             - Why?
            -Farrah.
            -Oh, no.
            - Farrah
      was just eliminated.
       I'm going to miss
          the whining.
      It was so charming.
             - Ooh.
       - Congratulations,
          Miss Alexis.
     - How are you feeling?
  - I'm usually so comfortable
           on my feet
    in front of an audience.
    And to choke like that,
        I scarcely know
         what happened.
  - Alexis is feeling a little
 shook up after this challenge.
       Her ego definitely
   got checked a little bit.
        And we're still
       asking ourselves,
   why is she fucking green?
      - Look at you trying
    to strip for the camera.
    - You're my best friend.
        You're my best--
             - Oh!
          [all laugh]
        - Bitch, shame.
   - Once again, I look over
  and Nina is off to the side
       not participating.
     She's somewhere else.
       You've been quiet.
  - Honestly, I did feel like
          some people
 were coming for me, you know.
 - Did someone say that to you
    or is this stuff that--
    - No, I can hear stuff.
  I could've swore I've heard
certain girls kind of talking--
  not saying my name, per se,
   but I feel like they were
   kind of talking about me.
         I'm not trying
         to make it up.
  - So you're saying you know
    that people are talking
    about you to each other.
     - A little bit, yeah.
             Yeah.
 - Nina thinks that everyone's
        out to get her.
  I think she thinks it's some
   kind of a drag conspiracy,
    and it's just not true.
  - I'm just taking things in.
     - It seems like you're
     starting to withdraw.
        I don't want you
      to go back to that.
      - Nina needs to call
         Patti LaBelle,
        'cause she needs
        a new attitude.
     - We started with 14,
    and there are seven now.
          - Ooh, shit,
       it's getting real.
        - At this point
      in the competition,

  to fall off left and right.

 that reaches millions of fans
       around the world.
     And now it's your turn
      to take your careers
       to the next level.
       So for this week's
        maxi challenge,
        you will create,
         write and star
     in your own TV pilot.
             - Oh!
             - Yes!
      - #YourPilotsOnFire.
          [all laugh]
    You need to come up with
concepts, characters and stories
    that lay the groundwork
    for a new hit TV series.
        You need to work
      in two teams of two
     and one team of three.
   That's called mathematics.
          [all laugh]
  I'll let you pick your teams
           right now.
            - Brrr.
  - Of course, Sasha and Shea
     cling to one another.
      Surprise, surprise.
      - Oh, my God. Okay.
       I was going to go
   and make a bee line toward
  the other side of the room,
       but turned around
and there was two lovely ladies
      walking towards me,
     so I couldn't really,
           like, run.
        - Y'all love me
  and you think I'm creative,
      but you ran past me
 to the next person. All right.
            - Yeah?
          Okay, yeah.
    - They were like, okay,
    I guess we're teammates.
    - Now, whatever you do,
      make your charisma,
  uniqueness, nerve and talent
         binge-worthy.
          So good luck
     and don't fuck it up.
           [applause]
    - So cops is an option.
      What are some other,
       like, situations?
            - Spies.
       - Is now the time
    for the Russian accent?
          [both laugh]
        - That's right.
     - I finally get to do
      a Russian character.
        I'm so excited.
     [Russian accent] Like,
    I hacked into the villa.
          [both laugh]
    I hacked into Versace's
       spring collection.
 - Does anybody have any ideas
       right off the bat?
         - I have one.
  So my idea is, I think there
  should be two church ladies.
       Each of your sons
     just came out as gay.
        And then a nun.
         I think a nun
     would be really funny.
         - I like that.
       - We're aiming for
   something very religious,
     but with a gay twist.
         - This summer,
     two mothers, two sons,
        one holy secret.
        - That's great.
  Look, girls, you know what?
   This is going to be easier
  to spread out on the table.
             -Okay.
     -Let's do it up here.
     - I really would like
     to do the voiceovers.
             -Okay.
   -Um, I know that normally
        there's only one
        voiceover voice.
   I would love if there was
     a way to split it up,
just because I feel like I have
a lot to prove after last week.
 - I think it needs to be clear
        who's speaking.
     It would be confusing
            to them.
        - I would rather
   one of you two just do it.
 So flip a coin or one of y'all
   just, you know, step back
  and let the other one do it.
     - I know for sure that
    I really want to do it,
    but I don't want to have
    a fight with Peppermint.
 - Can we just read through it
        a couple times?
            - Yeah,
    we need a read-through.
        - So now Alexis
   wants to do the voiceover.
       Mm-mm. She's gonna
     have to pry this part
      from my cold, dead,
        manicured hands.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
  - Where are the Espadrilles?
          -[chuckles]
           -Children!
       - Beat me, bitch.
          [both laugh]
           - [coughs]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
- "If you could create your own
hit TV show, what would it be?"
        For this week's
        maxi challenge,
          we're making
       our own TV shows.
       I'm not not happy
that I have to write something.
     It's just I feel like
        I have to prove
      that I have a talent
     that I might not know
       that I might have,
        but I hope I do.
   - Okay, so what can we do?
             Okay.
    - Maybe we work together
         in an office.
    - Okay. It could be like
some kind of like "Maury" show,
     like who's baby is it
         or something.
         I don't know.
      - Nina and Valentina
    have ended up together,
           and I say
      recipe for disaster.
  - We have to know our lines.
     - That's gonna be easy
       because we can go
      based off of improv
    in the moment, you know.
        - We can adlib,
       yeah, yeah, yeah.
       - I think we have
       a great chemistry,
     and I know the judges
      personally love us.
   So I think that's gonna be
        to our benefit.
   - So you come and join me
  over here on the dark side.
 Is it just to work next to me
  'cause you love me so much?
   - That's about half of it.
          I'm just not
        feeling too good
  about, like, my relationship
      with Nina right now.
   - You two were very tense
           last week.
      - Yeah. My feelings
     were just really hurt.
    - Some girls here think,
    oh, she's not original.
   Oh, she's not being funny,
            she's--
   -Who is saying that, Nina?
             -You.
         - What, bitch?
     No, I never said that.
         -Yes, you did.
     -When did I say that?
        - You've said it
        more than once.
   - I wasn't even trying to
   throw any of that your way
      'cause I don't play
     those games with you.
         I have always
      looked out for you.
  I have always built you up.
      I have defended you.
         So it actually
   really hurts my feelings,
             'cause
      that's not who I am,
   and I've never done that.
   This morning, I felt like
  she was even more cold to me
      and, like, distant.
     And I was just, like,
      I think I just need
     to just kind of, like,
  distance myself a little bit
   so I can concentrate more
      on the competition.
The energy that she's giving me
     is just really whack,
     and I've just kind of
       reached my limit.
           I'm done.
         - Why, hello.
              -Hi.
         -Well, hello.
           - Welcome,
       ladies and sister.
    - It's time for my team
     to shoot our TV pilot.
  I actually feel pretty good
       about our chances.
          We're pros,
         we look great,
     and Alexis looks like
Kathleen mother fucking Turner.
   - You've got the pit crew
            to use,
 and you can use whatever props
     and furniture you need
        from 204 Events.
         - Let's start
       with the voiceover
      so we can get those
        out of the way.
    Does that work for you?
       - Great. Perfect.
         Trinity Taylor
     as Sister Mary Koont,
     "Mary, Mother Of Gay."
        - Cut. How about
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay?"
        - Trinity Taylor
      as Sister Mary Koont
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay."
    -That was pretty great.
          -Thank you.
    - Did you all get the T
           on Koont?
   - We did the time before.
          -Okay, cool.
             -Yeah.
         - You probably
        want to move on.
        - Next scene is
 we are in the sister's office
         in the church.
     - Do it in the rectory
          real quick?
           - [laughs]
           The what?
      - If I had a nickel.
          And action.
 - Your son is always listening
    to Broadway show tunes.
        - Well, your son
    is always baking cakes.
    - Alexis, your accent's
 just a little bit too twangy.
    Where we're "bay a cay."
      You don't have to go
         too hillbilly.
     - Yeah. A little more
       Julia Sugarbaker?
          - Alexis has
    a real opportunity here
         to go extreme
   with this crazy character,
       and she's playing
    this conservative lady.
     Really conservatively.
    - Your son bakes cakes.
    - Well, your son always
  has something in his mouth.
      - Children, it's not
     the end of the world.
  - Trinity, just bring it up.
  These are two loud bitches,
  so you gotta overpower them.
             -Okay.
       -That is not my--
         -Mercy, Lord.
           -Children!
           - [laughs]
   - Father Ross, his breath
 always smells like dick, too.
           - [laughs]
            [coughs]
   - Can we say "dick" on TV?
     - Of course, you can.
   "The Dick Van Dyke Show."
  - He said "dick" and "dyke."
            - Well.
- That's good family television
          right there.
      - It is. Thank you.
        Welcome, ladies.
             -Hey.
   -Tell us what's going on.
        - We're gonna do
      a funky spy dramedy.
   - [Russian accent] And I'm
  an ex-Commie Russian mommy.
   - I'm gonna be a Kung Fu,
        fighting crime.
      - Are we doing like
 a blaxploitation feeling here
     where things are like,
           pow, boom?
       -Yes. Absolutely.
             -Yeah.
      - Okay, let's start
  with your voiceover. Action.
      - This unlikely duo
   will have to work together
  to defeat the greatest evil
          of all time.
         - Bad fashion.
      - Okay. I would love
     for you to go for it.
        Be those voices.
          - It's like
    the Moviefone recording.
             -Yeah.
     -Welcome to Moviefone.
         - Yeah, yeah.
     - If you know the name
of the movie you'd like to see,
         press one now.
           -Perfect.
          -And action.
       - "Teets & Asky."
    - See you next Tuesday.
         - At midnight,
         mother fucker.
           -[laughs]
        -That was great.
  - Where are the Espadrilles?
        I said where are
        the Espadrilles?
   Bitch, I'm talking to you!
       I said, where are
        the Espadrilles?
     - [laughs and coughs]
          - Look good?
          [all laugh]
      -That's perfection.
    -That works. That works.
   - Good, good, good, good,
           let's go.
     Tick-tock, tick-tock.
        You don't stop.
    - Um, next up is Sunset?
             -Yes.
            -Action.
     Friends forever, BFFs.
   Looks like Ernie and Bert.
              Oh.
             - Oh.
       -This feels wrong.
        -Really awkward.
         That's a wrap
       on "Teets & Asky."
   Thanks for being prepared.
             -Whoo!
             -Aah!
  - Valentina and Nina Bo'Nina
      Brown Jessy Raphael.
       - What's the name
          of the show?
        -"Nina & Tina."
             -Okay.
  Do we have voiceovers to do?
        - We didn't get
      to really finish it.
      But I can try to go
          off my head.
    - Just go for it, okay?
             Ready?
          And action.
      - Nina and Valentina
       move to Hollywood.
         I mean, okay,
     Nina and Tina, sorry.
-So is it Valentina or is it...
        -No, it's Tina.
        Yeah, I'm sorry.
    - Okay, okay, all right.
   You can do it again, baby.
            - Sorry.
       Nina and Valentina
      moved to Hollywood.
   - Is it Valentina or Tina?
            - Tina.
         - Soon after,
       Nina and Valentina
     were finally released
           from jail.
           - [snorts]
    What's your next scene,
             girls?
       So talk us through
  what you're doing right now.
          - All right.
  So right now, she's in jail.
      We're gonna play off
 of each other, just adlibbing.
    -Oh, you're gonna adlib?
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - There's zero preparation.
       Ready and action.
             - Oh!
      - Girl, let's just--
 we have so much time in here.
       We need to become
          drag queens.
           - [laughs]
          Okay, okay.
     - We need to become...
         -Drag queens.
         -Drag queens.
      - Do you think maybe
  a script would have helped?
            - Yeah.
        - Okay. I think
     we better keep moving.
       - Yeah, let's go.
   All right, talk us through
        this next scene,
            because
     it looks really messy.
       - Trying to learn
       how to do makeup,
     how to pad and things,
    so we're kind of like...
   - With household products.
   - 'Cause we're, you know,
       we're out of jail.
   We're gonna be like, girl,
it shouldn't be hard to do this.
       What, foundation?
      Like, I'm doing her
    with the--this is her--
   - No, I think we should do
        our own makeup.
  Should we do our own makeup
 or should we do each other's?
   - What do you want to do?
     - I think each other,
        but it's on you.
         - Should we do
      each other's makeup?
     - Yeah, it'll be fine,
            I think.
      - All right, ladies,
           you ready?
    - Makeup removal wipes.
  We need to take our lips off
         really quick.
       - Why do you want
       to take them off?
        - Well, because
     we're doing a makeup.
 -Oh, you're gonna put them on.
 -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - I need a Ritalin smoothie
      just to watch this.
         - Oh, my God.
           Tick-tock.
          And action.
     - You know, when times
        were hard, girl,
    a little pancake batter
        went a long way.
         Oh. Oh, girl,
    that is your skin tone.
  You look painted, mama. Oh.
           - [laughs]
      - Oh, I just feel it
       going in my pores.
          Oh, my God.
     Grace Jones realness.
         [both chuckle]
           Ugh, ooh.
        Beat me, bitch.
           - [laughs]
      - All right, ladies,
        your time is up.
    - That was really, um...
         -Interesting.
         -Interesting.
        - I have no idea
  how this is gonna turn out,
      but there's laughter
          in the room,
        and that's what
       we're here to do.
     - I mean, it was very
     entertaining to watch,
          even though
   it was like a train wreck.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
          Category is
       Club Kid couture.
   - It's okay. The K should
 wear off in about 15 minutes.
          [all laugh]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - It's elimination day,
   and it's time to get ready
 for today's runway, Club Kid.
             - Oh.
  - I've been waiting for this
        the entire time.
        I'm so excited.
       - She's beautiful.
       I want this dress.
           - This is
    one of the first dresses
      I ever wore in drag,
           actually.
    -You think I'm kidding.
    -No, I know you're not,
          but I'm not
     gonna give it to you.
  - Well, if she goes missing,
       I didn't take it.
           - [laughs]
    Good luck fitting in it.
             -Whoo!
           -That ass.
         - Shady bitch.
        - You foundation
     the back of your head?
            - Yeah.
        - Yeah, she does
        her whole head.
   - I contour my head, too,
        when I'm doing,
      like, beauty makeup.
   - What does it do, though?
 You're like, my head's so big,
     I need to contour it.
     - Ooh! Good one, girl.
         - I don't have
      that much experience
        with this whole
        Club Kid thing,
         but I will say
       I'm super excited.
- Have you done a Club Kid look
        before, Trinity?
  - I've never really done it
  because I don't want people
  to, like, laugh at me for--
    Oh, well, that was cute.
  Club Kid drag is completely
    outside my comfort zone,
          so I wanted
    to just be over the top.
- In the nineties, the Club Kids
     changed drag forever.
   They had an influence on,
   like, every type of drag.
   Beauty drag, pageant drag,
   it all has, I think, felt
  the legacy of the Club Kids.
       - Yeah, for sure.
    - It was an underground
         party culture
     that really pushed the
boundaries of queer aesthetics.
   It didn't just shift drag.
      It shifted fashion.
      - I remember seeing
         the Club Kids
           on, like,
      daytime talk shows,
          like Geraldo
     and Sally Jessy, yeah.
- All of them, James St. James,
         Amanda Lepore.
     - And Susanne Bartsch.
     He wasn't exactly part
  of the core New York scene,
 but Leigh Bowery is very much
  the spirit of the Club Kids.
          - Club Kids
   have influenced drag today
        in going beyond
      female impersonation
   and really thinking about
becoming a piece of moving art.
       - Oh, my God. Oh!
              Oh!
         [stomps foot]
             Oh...
   - Are you using hot glue?
             -Yeah.
   -Oh, my God, on your face?
    - Don't burn your skin,
             girl.
         - That's such
      a drag queen sound.
         That pop, pop.
     Sound familiar, Nina?
       - Right. [laughs]
    - Hey, Nina, am I right
     in sort of perceiving
  that you seem to be a little
    lighter in spirit today?
    - No, I'm still cursing
 y'all bitches out in my head.
          [all laugh]
            - Girl.
   - No, I'm good, you know.
  Just sometimes you just need
a little quiet time to yourself.
          - It's nice
      to see you happier.
          - Let's see
       how long it lasts.
        - [laughs] Girl!

         Category is...
         Sasha Velour,
        clown in a gown.
   I want a Jumbo Jack fries.
     - I'm really enjoying
    this freaky high fashion
        clown character.
          It's so true
    to the Club Kid spirit.
         - Marcel Mar--
     no, she better don't.
     - Don't cry out loud.
          Shea Coulee
     serving Leigh Bowery.
  - That swimsuit's so tight,
      I can read her lips.
          [all laugh]
  - It's like a pearl necklace
       around your mouth.
 - She's really sunk her teeth
      into this challenge.
      - I am bringing you
   twisted Club Kid royalty.
          It's freaky,
    but I know they into it.
  -Is she giving me side-eye?
        -I think she is.

           Valentina.
   - I didn't know there was
   a SARS outbreak in Mexico.
          [all laugh]
  - The running of the queens.
           - Tonight,
       I'm very espanola,
     looking like a matador
        with these nails
        and this luxury
   and this fabulous sparkle.
       Like, this is what
   I would do as a Club Kid.
     - She's putting the ho
       in Old El Pas-ho.
          [all laugh]
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - "Fifth Element" realness.
   - I've never actually seen
    a lady with blue balls.
              -No.
             -Hmm.
    - I'm giving you alien,
            robotic,
   venereal disease realness.
    There is no beauty queen
          here, honey.
           -Dat ass.
             -Mmm.
   - It's okay. The K should
 wear off in about 15 minutes.
          [all laugh]
         - Peppermint.
        - How many licks
         does it take?
          [all laugh]
     - BDSM Lollipop Guild.
   - My runway look is a mix
     between the exquisite
          Leigh Bowery
         and the genius
          Klaus Nomi.
      - Curiously strange.
   - Oh, that was refreshing.
          [all laugh]
        Alexis Michelle.
   - I can see her trapezoid.
       - Oh! I think this
     is the perfect outfit
        to be weighed in
    at the doctor's office.
        - [laughs] Yes.
   - I'm not used to showing
       my body like this,
         so this feels
       really empowering.
       I am serving body,
        I'm serving sex,
  and I'm serving graphic art.
            - I see
     her bridge and tunnel.
      [Michelle chuckles]
     - Thank you, Michelle.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
           - Welcome
     to the RuTV Up Fronts.
      It's time to screen
   your pilot presentations.
     First up, Sasha Velour
        and Shea Coulee.
       - The year: 1980.
       Meet super glamour
     mama-jamma Teets McGee
  and ex-Commie Russian mommy
         Natasha Asky.
            This duo
   will have to work together
  to defeat the greatest evil
          of all time.
         - Bad fashion.
       Pussy in the lap?
    - [Russian accent] Meow.
     - I'm down with that.
      Pussy on a sweater?
     That deserves a slap.
     - Wearing white after
  international day of labor?
          If you were
     my mother's daughter,
      she would drown you
           in river.
              Ha!
        - Bitch, I said
   where are the Espadrilles?
      Don't make me bring
      your mama into this.
        - But the people
  they end up helping the most
      will be each other.
      - Why are you using
    all these shoulder pads?
  - How else can I make myself
    look like strong woman?
         - Vote, bitch.
    - There will be twists,
    turns, and cliffhangers.
      - Please don't jump.
        You have so much
          to live for.
 - Shea Coulee and Sasha Velour
       are Teets & Asky.
    - See you next Tuesday.
         - At midnight,
        mother [bleep].
           [applause]
     - I can't wait to get
  the Teets & Asky lunch box.
          [all laugh]
  Up next, Valentina and Nina
  Bo'nina Brown Miller-Boyett.
           - [snorts]
        - How you doing?
          You looking
       for some company?
   - Two ladies of the night
     are thrown into jail.
           - [gasps]
      -We've been framed!
      -We've been framed!
    - What are their names?
         Nina and Tina.
        - Put your legs
       behind your head.
      You're under arrest.
             - Oh!
       - And this is how
        it all started.
       Buddy, you'll hear
        from my lawyer.
     Bitch, because of you
         we're in here.
  - I told you to stay on your
    corner where you belong.
          [both gasp]
     -"RuPaul's Drag Race."
     -"RuPaul's Drag Race."
        - I have a plan.
      - The two frenemies
      continued to polish
  all that entails to becoming
America's next drag superstars.
     - Girl, we have to do
         a death drop.
     - One, two, three, go!
           Oh, girl.
         Are you okay?
  - Oh, I thought a death drop
     means you really die.
             - Aah!
     <i> - ♪ Hey, kitty girl ♪</i>
       - They finally got
      their drag together
          and competed
    in "RuPaul's Drag Race."
             -Ooh.
             -Damn.
         - Oh, my God.
        - You can catch
         "Nina & Tina"
  on Channel Zero at 4:00 A.M.
          - [chuckles]
          [lone clap]
         - I'm not even
    gonna look at the judges
     'cause I'm quite sure
      they're doing a face
   of what the hell was that.
  So I'm gonna look at the TV
     so I don't see y'all.
     - Last, but not least,
  Trinity Taylor, Peppermint,
      and Alexis Michelle.
    - Two mothers, two sons,
        one holy secret.
          -Oh, my gay!
          -Oh, my gay!
   - Desperate for guidance,
   they turned to the holiest
       mother they know,
       Sister Mary Koont.
      - Our sons are gay.
      -And it's her fault!
      -And it's her fault!
       - Listen, your son
    is always baking cakes.
- Ooh, honey, your son is always
  got something in his mouth.
    - This is not my fault.
      This is your fault.
  - Honey, you ain't no godly
    Christian woman at all.
          - Children!
     You know, Father Ross,
    his breath always smells
        like dick, too.
     - This nun shows them
    how to get closer to God
        through prayer.
  - Ladies, get on your knees.
    - Oh! This doesn't feel
         very ladylike.
        - Mm-hmm. I know
     you know how to do it.
     - Just pray, damn it!
          - Communion.
      - Open wide, ladies.
            - [gags]
           -Swallow!
       -And celebration!

         - Oh, hallelu.
       Ladies, I've made
        some decisions.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Frankly, the clever
   word play and the writing
    I do think came from me.
      - I have to speak up
           right now.
     That is not the case.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
       - Ladies, based on
    your pilot presentations
   and your Club Kid couture,
   I've made some decisions.
   Sasha Velour, Shea Coulee.
       Con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winners
   of this week's challenge.
        You've each won
   a $1,000 gift certificate
     from The Spa On Rodeo,
     and a sickening supply
     of hair care products
      provided by Aquage.
      And the hair doesn't
    have to be on your head.
          [all laugh]
            - Good.
   - You may leave the stage.
   - Yes. We the dream team.
         - Oh, my God.
     it's actually amazing
to win working with Shea again.
         I'm so happy.
   - That means you're all up
        for elimination.
         Now it's time
    for the judge's reviews,
starting with Nina Bo'nina Brown
       Stuart Masterson.
- Tonight on the runway, I love
  what you did with your face.
    Your makeup is intense.
      It's really insane.
         - But I think
        the torso part,
   it looks a little bit like
    an afterthought for me.
   - I wanted to paint this,
    like, elaborate ribcage,
but didn't have time, so I just
  kind of did what I could do.
          - Let's talk
      about "Nina & Tina."
            - Okay.
     - I felt like you guys
   came with no preparation.
         I really wish
       you had a script.
          - Shows like
     "Curb Your Enthusiasm"
    are completely improv'd,
but they always have a structure
       so they don't just
       fly off the rails.
          -Valentina.
            -Hello.
       - Your runway look
    I think is spectacular.
   - But I'm getting way more
high fashion than I am Club Kid.
  And in the acting challenge,
     same thing goes here.
       I didn't feel like
    you guys were prepared,
    and I feel like you guys
        kind of wandered
         until you got
     to where it was going.
     - It sort of felt like
         a movie to me.
   There has to be a formula
 that you can fill every week,
   so it can't be wrapped up
    after the first episode.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
     - I have to say, that
  is my favorite runway look.
      It is so well done.
     - This was really hard
            for me.
   You know, it's not easy to
 look like a venereal disease.
          [all laugh]
- Everything about it rings true
      to Club Kid for me.
           I love it.
        It's super fun.
        Let's talk about
         Sister Koont.
        You went for it.
          - Children!
       - And you ended up
    being the scene stealer.
     - You took directions
        so beautifully,
     and the moment we said
       go bigger with it,
        you embraced it
  and you were the comedy gold
   of "Mary, Mother of Gay."
       Really well done.
      - Thank you so much.
           - Up next,
     hard candy Peppermint.
- I'll never forget who you are
    because of your outfit.
       It's so on brand.
        - This is really
      bringing back, like,
    The Tunnel and Club USA
  and all those great places.
          - Thank you.
            - I like
    that it's over the top.
  - She could also leave here
 and go to "Let's Make A Deal."
       What I loved about
     "Mary, Mother of Gay"
    was that it was totally
      actual sitcom beats.
             Like,
    when they said the name
         and you looked
      at the camera like.
    You did the voiceovers.
    You committed completely
         to your role.
       I thought you did
       a really good job.
          -Thank you.
   -Up next, Alexis Michelle.
             - Hi.
    - Tonight on the runway,
     not my favorite look.
     It is a body stocking
       with a corset on.
       This is beautiful,
     your hair and makeup.
          -Thank you.
     -It's just almost like
     it doesn't make sense
  with the rest of the outfit.
  They're two different looks.
    - In terms of the pilot,
 your performance, for me, did
sort of get lost in the shuffle.
     - Maybe your character
       didn't pop as much
      because you took on
  a lot of the producer role.
   - I want to say something,
and I don't intend by any means
     to throw my beautiful
   teammates under for this.
      But I do think that
   a lot of the organization
    and, frankly, the clever
    wordplay and the writing
    I do think came from me.
    In trying to keep things
     running and organized,
  I may have taken a back seat
 in the size of my performance.
      - I have to speak up
           right now.
  The way that this discussion
         is going down,
     it sounds like Alexis
 was the producer of our pilot.
     That is not the case.
          You were not
       the only person--
  - I didn't mean to say that.
           - That was
      writing things down.
   The three of us did put in
   a balanced amount of work.
  - I also felt that there was
  a little bit of me, me, me.
 Peppermint felt very strongly
   about doing the voiceover.
     - Okay. I did say that
 I wanted to do the voiceover,
    but you could have said,
     before we go to shoot,
  let's talk about this again.
        - It wasn't much
        of a discussion.
  It felt like it was claimed.
        - I want to say
       one thing as well.
   As a team, all three of us
put in the same amount of work.
    It was all of our ideas.
  - And please let me repeat,
 I was not trying to throw you
     under, either of you.
        But in focusing
       on administration,
     my performance was not
 the same size as my co-stars.
      - Thank you, ladies.
      We've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
  All right, now, just between
       us network execs,
          let's start
      with "Nina & Tina."
- This was a difficult challenge
     for Nina and Valentina
            because
    it was very structured,
     and I don't feel like
they're very structured people.
      - They were spinning
    their wheels in the mud.
    They were going nowhere,
         and they were
      going nowhere fast.
   However, could I sit there
 and watch them do it forever?
             - Aah!
          -Absolutely.
             -Sure.
       - I mean, this is
     a Night at the Improv
    you don't want to miss.
 - I'm just really disappointed
         with these two
        because there's
      so much comedy gold
that could be made into a sitcom
   with these two characters.
  This week on "Nina & Tina,"
       the old prostitute
        from Chattanooga
   teaches the girls a lesson
   about hot water cornbread.
   Michelle, write this down.
          I think this
     is a really good idea.
      -I got it, I got it.
          -Yeah, good.
        Trinity Taylor.
          - As far as
       Sister Mary Koont,
    she went for it balls to
  the wall and she delivered.
   Tonight was a great night
          for Trinity.
     - Although I do think
        that she really
     committed to the part,
    the pilot that they did
     is my least favorite.
    - Listen, it was cliché
     and not that original.
       I think the show's
      gonna be a big hit.
          [all laugh]
          Peppermint.
     - Everything that you
    need to do in a sitcom,
       I think Peppermint
           delivered.
   - And she really nailed it
       in the voiceover.
         -That's true.
     -Because that's really
          set the tone
      for the whole piece.
             -Yeah.
       -Alexis Michelle.
    - She was very prepared,
        knew her lines.
 - I don't like that she turned
  on her teammates like that.
       - I just feel like
     she was making excuses
    for why her performance
       didn't pop for us.
     At the end of the day,
 you just have to be memorable
      in the presentation,
        and she wasn't.
          [clap, clap]
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
  Peppermint, Trinity Taylor,
 your performances were crass,
       crude and clichéd.
       You're both safe.
           -[laughs]
          -Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
      Nina Bo'nina Brown,
 your skeletal look is killer,
      but you really boned
          your pilot.
    I'm sorry, my dear, but
   you're up for elimination.
      - I already knew it.
       Call me Miss Cleo.
  - Valentina, on the runway,
    you gave us Spanish fly,
  but your pilot didn't land.
 Alexis Michelle, at this point
      in the competition,
       there's no excuse
     for not standing out.
         - Oh, my God.
- Alexis Michelle, your prayers
      have been answered.
          You're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
     - Valentina, my dear,
           I'm sorry,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
  Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
      The time has come...
           [thunder]
      for you to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
     - Nothing can explain
        what I'm feeling
     as I'm waiting to have
    to lip sync for my life.
          I'm scared.
          - Good luck

           - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
      Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
          - Thank you.
         - You can join
        the other girls.
           Valentina,
  I thought you had the stuff
       to go all the way.
        Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
   I'm so humiliated tonight.
   I want to be here so bad.
      I don't want to go.
            [crying]
       <i> Los quiero mucho.</i>
        I never imagined
        this was the way
   that it was going to end.
            [sighs]
       I wanted to leave
    putting up a good fight,
      and that's something
   I wasn't able to do today.
   But I don't want to leave
     feeling disappointed.
      I want to leave here
       feeling grateful.
  - My queens, never give up.
         And remember,
  if you can't love yourself,
        how in the hell
 you gonna love somebody else?
           Can I get
      an amen up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
          - All right.
    Now let the music play.

         - I don't want
         to be Grandrea.

      - You weren't really
       selling the lines.
  - Where are the cool people?
              -Aja.
  -You were playing the bitch,
    and it felt kind of flat
             for me.
    You basically handed Shea
       a moment to shine.
        - Trinity Taylor,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
        Aja, sashay away.
         - Oh, that was
   a rough, rough one, honey.
             -Whoo.
              -Oh.
      - I feel heartbroken.
    Aja was my Brooklyn boo,
     and I'm really, really
         gonna miss her.
        - "Love you guys.
           XOXO, Aja."
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
    - Anybody got any Windex?
           - [laughs]
   The truth is, I'm thrilled
  to see the room thinning out
because I know I'm the contender
      in this competition.
       - Aren't y'all two
       neck and neck now?
     - Well, I have two wins
        and she has a win
    and then a partnered win.
              -Ooh!
              -Ooh!
     - But also, weren't you
       in the bottom two?
     And I never even landed
   in the bottom three, bitch.
           What's up?
              - Oh.
             -Ouch.
              -Oh!
           [all laugh]
     - I'm kind of jealous.
       I want to win, too.
          'Cause we're
        at the point now
    where if you haven't won
 at least one challenge, then...
        why are you here?
  - Well, how do you feel being
    told that you're perfect?
             Again.
         - They told you
         you're perfect?
    - One day, she'll run out
         of perfection.
      - Yeah, we'd all like
        to be in the top,
     but the cookie doesn't
    always crumble that way.
          - Thank you,
        JonBenet Ramsey.
           [all laugh]
        - At this point,
   there's only two girls who
have not won any challenges yet,
     Peppermint and Farrah.
    That ain't a good thing.
    - Hey, Farrah, thanks for
looking like a drag queen today.
           [all laugh]
         - Peppermint's
      for sure in trouble,
        and Farrah's days
     are for sure numbered.
            Bye-bye,
      do not collect $200,

   Shea Coulee, you remind me

          Your fashion,

         and your smile,
         <i> Jurassic Park.</i>

       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
      your pads are so big,
      you bend down to pick
   something up off the street
  and the garbage man says, who
  left this raggedy couch here?

         all those mens
          that buy you
      fancy designer shoes,
  they're not your boyfriends.
      They're called johns,
   and they're your employers.
              -Ooh.
              -Ooh.
        Shea-Shea Coulee,
  you sure are a scene stealer.

        - That felt good.

    sure does look expensive,
   but money can't buy talent.
              -Ooh.
              -Hey!
    - Farrah. You really are
     the social media queen.
 Too bad you can't get a filter
      for that personality.
              -Oh!
              -Oh.

and I cannot wait to read it all
       in your biography:
     <i> Fifty Shades of Ashy.</i>
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle,
   you're oh, so ♪ Broadway ♪
   but you're also very broad.
         Trinity Taylor,
         I once told you
    that you're so beautiful
         inside and out.
   I lied, you ugly stripper.
           [all laugh]
    Ladies, we're going to do
          an exercise.
    Everybody raise your arms
         up to the sky.
   And, Shea, this is for you.
            One word:
        deodorant, bitch!
           [all laugh]
    Peppermint, you need one.
           [all laugh]
  - I told y'all she's sneaky.
   - Oh, my God, I hate doing
       this kind of stuff.
            - I know.
           - Sasha...
           [all laugh]
           You and Ru
      have a lot in common.
      He's bald, you bald.
        He wear glasses,
        you wear glasses.
           He's rich--
           Never mind.
           [all laugh]
   Alexis, you're like a BMW.
        Body made wrong.
              - Oh!
     - Valentina, you think
     you're Miss Venezuela,
      but you're more like
        Miss Quinceañera.
           - Oh, man.
       - Alexis Michelle,
        Pillsbury called.
   They want their rolls back.
              -Ooh.
              -Oh.
    - Okay, that's all I got.
    - Thank you, Farrah Moan.
            -Farrah.
        -I can't do that.
         - Oh, you did.
          - The library
      is officially closed.
         Now, you're all
          avid readers,
         but one of you
     is the head librarian.
           Valentina.
        - Oh, you did it!
 - You've won a four-night stay
       for you and a guest
  at the Saguaro Palm Springs.
   - Oh, I love Palm Springs.
   - Now, reading one another
         do take nerve,
          but you need
     titanium balls and tits
   to read a legendary queen.
       So for this week's
         maxi challenge,
     we're bringing back...
       <i> The RuPaul Roast.</i>
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
         - #RuPaulRoast.
    But this time, our guest
    of dishonor won't be me.
           The person
    you'll be roasting is...
        Michelle Visage.
           [all cheer]
          And get this.
        She has no idea.
            -[gasps]
          -Oh, my God.
 - Now, Valentina, since you won
     the reading challenge,
     you'll decide the order
       of the presenters.
     And a word of warning,
             ladies.
     Michelle never forgets.
          [evil laugh]
      So don't fuck it up.
           [applause]
             - Whoo!
      - Here we go, y'all.
    - What are you thinking,
           Valentina?
    - Do you know what order
       you want to go in?
       - I want to go just
    somewhere in the middle.
    - Valentina, I know that,
      like, first and last
            are like
     the hardest positions,
        and I don't mind
       either one of them.
     - Okay. So going first,
     it's going to be Shea.
          - All right.
 - Second is going to be Sasha.
             - Okay.
     - Third is going to be
      the one and only me.
     Going fourth, Trinity.
         Fifth, Farrah.
       Sixth, Peppermint.
  Seventh, Nina Bo'nina Brown.
      And closing our show
           is Alexis.
          - Time for us
     to start writing jokes.
           Be clever.
        That's the goal.
         - Here's a tip.
  Don't make it about my body.
         - Oh, my Lord.
       - I was surprised.
      You guys came from--
  anything to do with my size.
          I just, like,
      would have preferred
   not to do with body image.
   So that's all I have to say
           about that.
            - People,
     we can't be sensitive.
    It's a comedy challenge.
      - Girl, get over it.
         You knew people
     were going to read you.
  You made fun of other people.
           Calm down.
   You're a drag queen, honey.
   - I'm sorry about my joke.
   - I don't want you to feel
     that I think it's okay
   to make you feel that way.
    - I feel like right now,
     Alexis is in her head,
        and I'm concerned
      that she's not going
     to take it far enough.
   And for a roast to be good,
    you gotta go all the way.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Everybody's nervous.
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
         <i> No digo nada.</i>
          - Bye, bitch.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
              - Oh.
          - Oh, my God.
     - We have to do a roast
       of Michelle Visage.
       Oh, my fucking God.
      Everybody's nervous.
 - Aja, you might have got lucky
      getting out of here.
         - I am frozen,
    and I'm not even talking
         about my face.
       - So I have my pen
           in one hand
       and I have my hand
      on a piece of paper,
        and I just think.
         And... nothing.
              Oh...
<i>Virgen de Gaudalupe, por favor,</i>
    <i> ayúdame en este momento</i>
      <i> porque no digo nada.</i>
  - Girl, Guadalupe ain't gonna
   write these jokes for you.
         You gotta do it
    for your own self, girl.
         So get to work.
          - [whimpers]
            - Hello.
              -Hi!
             -Hello.
              - Hi.
  - I brought Ross to help you
       with your material.
  - This is my first time ever
        in the workroom.
        Do you know that?
        - You're kidding.
        Oh, my goodness,
         well, welcome.
        - It's just like
         I pictured it.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
         -Hi, gentlemen.
              -Hi.
     - Now, a little birdie
        told me that you
    were a little miffed off
    by the reading challenge.
        - I just thought
       some of my sisters
     could have come up with
     more original material.
              - Oh.
   You were more disappointed
          than miffed.
     - No, the truth is, Ru,
       body image has been
  something I've struggled with
      for a lot of my life.
        And I have talked
         with my sisters
          and they know
    what I've struggled with.
        That's why it was
   a little bit, um, hurtful.
- So you feel like it's okay for
you to make fun of someone else,
      but not someone else
       to make fun of you.
     - Um, look, I will try,
            you know,
   whenever I come for anybody
         on that runway,
        to make sure that
  we're all laughing together.
       - Right. But that's
     the thing about comedy.
    You know, a lot of times,
  especially people who've been
   through hell and high water
         with an issue,
          the only way
        to get through it
   is to friggin' laugh at it.
         - Laugh at it,
          that's true.
     - Mm-hmm. 'Cause look,
          you survived.
             - Yeah.
   - Have you ever done comedy
             before?
            - I have.
  Actually, at my weekly show,
      I spend a lot of time
           on the mic.
      - And you're actually
    going last in the lineup.
   How do you feel about that?
          - I honestly
      was ready to open her
        and set the tone
        or close her out
   and, uh, let them eat cake.
       - Okay. All right.
    - Well, listen, you have
       experience in this.
              A lot
    of the other girls don't.
 And because you do, we're going
 to need you to bring it extra.
          - All right.
    We'll see you out there.
         Make us laugh.
            See you.
             - Bye.
       -Hey, Farrah Moan.
            -Oh, hi.
         - Now, you did
      the reading earlier.
     How'd that go for you?
      - Honestly, I really
      didn't like doing it.
     You know, I did go for
 a low blow with Alexis Michelle
    and it did not feel good.
   - Now, are you more worried
     about what other people
       will think of you?
    - I just am more worried
       about staying true
         to my integrity
     and not hurting anyone.
     - You're 12. What kind
    of integrity do you have?
           - [laughs]
            I get it.
          I would go on
  <i> Chelsea Lately</i> all the time,
    and that show was really
  about tearing down Hollywood.
  And my nature is to be nice,
            so I'd be
      the one in the corner
        going, but I like
        Jessica Simpson,
     you know, trying to...
             - Oh...
      - But it can be done.
    Lube her up a little bit.
             - Yeah.
     - You know what I mean?
  I love you, Michelle, but...
        - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
      - I'm the biggest fan
   of Michelle Visage, but...
        - Yeah, exactly.
    - Then it's not as mean.
            -Totally.
   -Except it's totally mean.
         - Yeah, right.
      Now, you haven't won
         any challenges.
            - I know.
     - Because at this point
       in the competition,
       if you haven't won
         any challenges,
         you may wind up
         in the bottom.
    - Oh, don't say that, Ru.
     -You gotta come for it.
             -Okay?
   - All right, make us laugh.
             - Yeah.
            -By-eee.
            -By-eee.
            [laughs]
    Hey, Pep-Pep-Peppermint.
       - Hey, yo, yo, Ru.
        -Hi. How are you?
        -Ross, hey, baby.
        -Good to see you.
        -Now, obviously,
     Michelle is the target
         of this roast.
      Does this scare you?
      Does this excite you?
      - It scares the shit
           out of me.
       - Tell me about it.
      - I've never roasted
         anyone before.
    - Are you a funny queen?
          - I think so.
         I mean, I think
       people will laugh.
       - I think you are,
 but so far in this competition,
     you've had some trouble
    getting out of the gate,
          so to speak.
  - I feel like it's more like
    crossing the finish line.
       - Okay, all right.
       - Ding, ding, dong.
    Are you hungry for a win?
         - I'm starving,
      and this is the time.
    - Well, that's up to you.
           All right,
       thanks, Peppermint.
          Sasha Velour.
           - Hi, guys.
    - Now, you're very smart.
      You're intellectual.
  How are you going to pull off
         a gutter roast?
    - I feel like my worries
      about not being funny
  have been getting in my way.
    - Are you funny in life?
   - That's the big question.
      I make people laugh,
        but in my shows,
         my edge is that
   it's serious and analytical
   and has a bit of philosophy
          and politics.
         - You gotta use
          what you got.
     Maybe you can use this
   sort of intellectual thing
     to make fun of yourself
   and then go after Michelle.
    You know what I'm saying?
          - Yeah, yeah.
   Now, how's the joke writing
          coming along?
- I'm having some writer's block
         with this one.
   - Well, time's running out.
            -I know.
  -Have you written any jokes?
    - I've written the words
    "mutton dressed as lamb."
           [all laugh]
        Which could apply
       to a lot of people.
             - Yeah.
      - This is going to be
        very interesting.
        - Just make sure
       you make us laugh.
          - Absolutely.
   - And don't forget, please,
         make us laugh.
           [all laugh]
            -See you.
            -See you.
          - All right,
    listen up, pretty girls.
    Roast them good, ladies.
            -Mm-hmm.
            -[laughs]
         Let's go, Ross.
          - Okay, bye.
         Bye, bye, bye.
             - Whoo!
    - So mutton is old sheep.
       - Okay, okay, okay.
    - And lamb is baby sheep.
     But also people use it
           to describe
     when someone who is old
           is dressing
       to appear younger.
         - Okay. Mm-mm.
          [both laugh]
           Bye, bitch.

       is the<i> RuPaul Roast</i>
     and this time, we'll be
    roasting Michelle Visage.
            -Farrah?
              -Yes.
    - I'm sorry I insinuated
     you were a prostitute.
     - Oh, thank you, baby.
            I'm sorry
    I made fun of your rolls,
          and I'm sorry
     for bringing it up now.
           [all laugh]
   - I'm sure that your johns
    are really lovely people.
              - Oh.
             -Whoo!
             -Whoo!
          - Okay, girl.
           [all laugh]
       - There's moments,
            you guys,
          where, like,
       there's a joke said
    and then everybody laughs
        and I look around
      and just start, like,
      laughing to blend in.
           [all laugh]
    - That was my experience.
       When I first lived
           in Russia,
    humor in another language
       is so challenging.
           - How long
       did you live there?
   - I lived there for, like,
      two and a half years
           altogether.
          - Oh, my God.
     I got stuck in Moscow.
     I was presenting female
    and my ID does not match.
   And I was in Moscow airport
        for a connection,
    I think, like 30 minutes.
   This was eight months ago.
          - Oh, my God.
        - And so we land
    and we're supposed to go
   to the little transfer desk
          or whatever.
         And the woman,
  she didn't speak any English,
    and she just kept looking
   at my ID and looking at me.
        And it was clear
    that she was disagreeing
       with the fact that
        my ID looked male
      and I looked female.
  Okay, so that's what it was.
       So she detained me.
            - Oh, my.
    That's really terrifying.
        - I was terrified
          to the point
      where I had to snatch
     my own wig off my head
           in the line
     with all these people.
          - Oh, my God.
     - Just to prove to her
           that I'm...
           this is me
    and please let me go in.
     It was so humiliating.
   - That's really a tragedy.
          There's a lot
    of gender fear in Russia.
             -Yeah.
        -I feel for her.
  When I was living in Russia,
    I had to disguise myself.
   I couldn't be Sasha Velour.
 I had to think carefully about
   what clothes I was wearing,
      how I moved my body.
   Queer people in Russia are
 living in an oppressive system.
        - I just have to
          keep in mind
    that it doesn't take away
          my womanhood.
             -Amen.
            -A-woman.

 - Welcome to the second annual
        <i> RuPaul's Roast.</i>
    This year, we are really
      switching things up.
       Instead of RuPaul,
      we are going to roast
     a man of true charisma,
           uniqueness,
        nerve and talent.
        [Michelle laughs]
         Unfortunately,
       he was unavailable,
       so it's going to be
        Michelle Visage.
 Michelle, we know you for being
     a kind, patient she-ro.
      And gonorrhea clinics
    know you as Patient Zero.
           [all laugh]
       Girl, you have had
        more shit in you
          than a urinal
       at Dodger Stadium.
     The only difference is
       they get cleaned up
       after a grand slam.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen,
         just remember,
  if you liked my performance,
     my name is Shea Coulee.
      And if you hated it,
    it's Nina Bo'nina Brown.
           [all laugh]
      [cheers and applause]
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.
       That was extremely
         edifying humor.
      Uh, sorry, am I using
      that word correctly?
          Not edifying.
        I know that one.
 It was humor that I wasn't sure
     worked in this context.
   Tonight, we really do have
         an opportunity
      to salute empowering
  representation in the media.
    We have an out and proud
        lesbian comedian.
       Thank you so much,
          Ross Mathews.

    Ross Mathews has the face
       of a young gay man
          and the voice
       of an adult woman.
         So the opposite
        of Tamar Braxton.
           [all laugh]
            - Bitch.
      I'm gonna get yo ass.
  - It's now come time to talk
 about Michelle Visage herself.
     Michelle is so Jersey,
   her idea of classical music
          is Lisa Lisa.
             - Hey!
        - Michelle Visage
          is so Jersey,
    she calls her pubic hair
  the Garden State Expressway.
 And let's not even get started
     on the Holland Tunnel.
             - Whoo.
      Michelle Visage is--
      I have more of these.
         Michelle Visage
          is so Jersey,
     she wanted to call her
   second child White Flight.
    Oh, well. That one worked
           in my mind.
  And now, a queen who combines
  all the excitement of smiling
         with the thrill
     of just standing there.
           [all laugh]
    Give it up for Valentina.
      [cheers and applause]
         - Mama RuPaul,
   you are the shadiest queen
 because you let Michelle Visage
   look so busted on Season 3
            and 4...
    and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8.
           [all laugh]
            And girl,
       that's your friend.
        That's fucked up.
   Michelle is such a<i> cochina</i>
       that she knows how
    to say and spell "harder"
   in six different languages.
            Michelle,
   you is such a tired-ass ho
 that when you got carpal tunnel
 from giving out free hand job,
  she just became left-handed.
       - I'm so confused.
   - Ross, you're just so cute
          and so sweet.
       You just remind me
       of a cute hamster.
    I just want to shove you
           up my butt.
              Boo!
      - [exaggerated drawl]
       Thank you, Paydro,
         mo-wee bee-in.
           <i> (muy bien)</i>
          Please excuse
      the way I'm dressed.
 I have to go feed the chickens
           after this,
    and I didn't want to wear
         my good things.
      I sometimes even have
    to wrestle a few of them.
  Michelle, you know all about
   wrestling cocks, don't you?
             I think
    we have a lot in common,
      from the same tastes
          in hairspray
        to the same units
        of Botox fillers,
   lips, tucks, nips and hips.
      Michelle, every time
       I walk the runway,
   you have this pungent look
          on your face,
          kind of like
        you got to shit.
       I reckon they have
    some laxatives for that.
         Just a secret.
          We all poop.
           [applause]
     - Let's get this roast
           a-cookin'.
         [clears throat]
          Can we please
     put our hands together
      for the one, the only
  Michelle Visage...'s breasts?
      They're the real star
          of the show.
         Sorry, RuPaul.
    Hmm. I find it hilarious
      that Michelle Visage
  judges a talent competition.
     I don't know about you,
   but don't you actually have
   to have talent to do that?
     Ha. And I'm pretty sure
 having one song in the nineties
   that no one even remembers
       doesn't qualify you
          to be a judge
     on such a big TV show.
  Good thing she's been sucking
   RuPaul's dick for so long.
              -Oh.
             -Whoo!
       - Oh, and we've got
   Tamar Braxton in the house.
        Tay-mar Braxton.
       However you say it.
    She's Toni Braxton's less
 talented, more annoying sister.
    [clears throat] Anyways,
 now that Michelle's dick breath
          has stunk up
       this entire stage,
 I'd like to introduce our next
  minty contestant, Peppermint.
      [cheers and applause]
          - Hey, y'all.
     Thank you, Farrah Moan.
           [all laugh]
       Ross, everyone says
   that your voice is annoying
        and high-pitched,
       but I actually love
   the sound of your voice...
           right now.
           - [laughs]
             - Shh!
     Don't talk, don't talk.
        Michelle Visage,
       Michelle, Michelle.
    Not since Destiny's Child
 has a Michelle become so famous
           for riding
   somebody else's coattails.
           [all laugh]
       RuPaul, all smiles,
        Ross, all smiles,
      Michelle, poker face.
         No, seriously.
     Someone poke her face.
      It doesn't even move.
        Michelle says no
         to everything.
            Michelle,
     you like my dress? No.
     You like my makeup? No.
             Bitch,
     where the hell were you
   when somebody asked you if
 you wanted to write that book?
           [all laugh]
  It's a great book, Michelle.
          Said no one.
           [all laugh]
    Honestly, I fell in love
       with you, Michelle,
     watching you and RuPaul
             on VH1,
   and I'm so honored to share
      this moment with you,
          so thank you.
      Happy 90th birthday,
            Michelle.

     to the man of the hour,
       RuPaul's secretary
        Michelle Visayge.
       You know, Michelle,
 your face reminds me of my hip.
             Stiff.
           Oh, Jesus.
     What's your name, baby?
      [laughter and groans]
             You are
      a whole lotta woman.
             Mm-hmm.
     Well, we normally save
       the best for last,
    but in this case, we had
 to settle for Alexis Michelle.
           [applause]
         - Oh, Michelle,
       Michelle, Michelle.
   In honor of your big night,
   I wore your favorite color,
         girl. [laughs]
              Um...
   We have so much in common,
            Michelle.
   We have the theater running
     in our veins, Michelle.
 You also have several venereal
 diseases running through yours,
           but that's
   besides the point. [laughs]
   But, you know, you're also
 an inspiration to me, Michelle.

  alcoholic WASP for ages now.
         Now, Michelle,
   I have to congratulate you
      on really being able
        to take the piss.
         Just ask the UK
     men's water polo team.
             - Okay.
    - She loves water sports.
        She loves the UK.
     And we love you, mama.
           Thank you,
      ladies and gentlemen.
         It's been real.
     Good night, everybody.
      [scattered applause]
          - This is not
         a happy ending.
    - And it don't help that
     you look like She Hulk.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
    - The jokes, they seemed
     more like observations.
     - You just looked like
   you were going to throw up.
       - This is a roast.
     You go hard or go home.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Earl Jones.
           Valentina.
      You ladies are safe.
    You may leave the stage.
          Now it's time
   for the judges' critiques.
           Let's start
        with Shea Coulee.
  - I know a thing or two about
  being somebody's opening act.
             - Yeah.
    - And, you know, you just
     set the tone, you know,
  to be funny, to be original.
        - And your jokes
       were really funny.
  I'm probably gonna steal them
and put them in my next special.
          - Have them.
          - Thank you.
      You did a great job.
          - Thank you.
    - Next up, Sasha Velour.
       - When you started
           the roast,
        I think you were
   way too smart for the room.
         But the minute
   you started laying into me,
     it was friggin' genius.
           - You have
      a very specific POV.
   You know, what does a roast
 look like through Sasha's eyes?
           And I think
    you gave us that tonight.
        - Trinity Taylor.
     - What I liked was that
      you had a character.
        - Mo-wee bee-in.
      - But everything else
       didn't work for me.
  - You didn't have the jokes.
      - I think even before
        you got up there,
      you just looked like
    you were gonna throw up,
          and you still
     kind of have that look.
  - It's the Botox, I promise.
           - Oh, okay.
       See, that's funny.
     And, like, I would have
     liked to have seen you
  sort of trust yourself more.
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.
            - Farrah,
     nothing landed, honey.
    If you're gonna be harsh,
         it has to land.
And I think everything that came
  out of your mouth was harsh.
     That's not a bad thing.
          It's a roast.
   But you gotta follow it up
       with a punch line.
      People have to laugh.
      - Yeah, I fucked up.
      - I wouldn't call it
        fucked up, but--
  - I would call it fucked up.
             - Okay.
     - Because we identified
  the problem in the workroom.
       You said being mean
        is not my nature.
  But if you don't like to say
       that person sucks,
          you can say,
    I love Michelle so much,
    I was dying to meet her.
    And she was exactly like
       I'd hoped she'd be,
     horrible in every way.
    It would have been a POV
            that none
     of the other girls had.
      - All right, up next,
       Pep-Pep-Peppermint.
        - So by the time
          you came up,
      I was hungry for just
     a good piece of roast,
       and you served it.
       - I was like Ross,
    just waiting for somebody
     to just come out there
      and bring the energy.
     And you just killed it.
    - And you look beautiful.
        It just all works
         for me tonight.
        - I would totally
        take you to prom.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
 - My question the whole entire
    time is why is she green?
  - Well, Tamar, have you ever
        watched the show?
        - But going green
          like you did,
           I expected
      like a Broadway thing
         'cause you look
          like Elphaba.
      And then, like, this
    Jersey accent comes out.
    - She likes water sports.
   - I was like, I don't know
           what to do
     with these two things.
      - I literally forgot
   there was an audience here.
  That's how silent they were.
  - And the jokes, they seemed
     more like observations.
   -You were almost too soft.
             -Yeah.
     - It was like you were
      afraid of hurting us.
        This is a roast.
     You go hard or go home.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
   All right, now just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think?
          Shea Coulee.
           - I thought
      she set a great tone.
       She didn't shy away
         from her jokes.
          I was a fan.
      - But on the runway,
  is it the most creative look
        we've ever seen?
         - Sasha Velour.
    - I was panicked for her.
    Then she got this formula
     that she just inserted
   the jokes in and it worked.
     - The way she was like
       analytical at first
    didn't bother me because
   it worked with her outfit,
        and she was funny
         on top of that.
 You know, she was really smart
       about being smart.
      - Yeah, it was a real
  breakthrough moment for her.
         Trinity Taylor.
      - The father, the son
       and the holy ghost.
             -Yeah.
    -We're not with Trinity.
              -No.
           -Not today.
           - The jokes
   just weren't strong enough.
             -Yeah.
       -It was road kill.
           - [laughs]
       That's good eatin'.
        - But the outfit
          was on point.
       It was super cute.
    I'm from North Carolina,
         so I felt like
        she fit right in
   with my white trash people.
         - Farrah Moan.
   - I thought she reminded me
        of Marilyn Monroe
     when she did the whole
     birthday thing for JFK.
          And I thought
      she was gonna come up
   and do her whole character
       [breathy] like this
   and it would've been funny.
     But what it came across
     as a really nervous kid
   who came to tell people off
         in a harsh way.
     - You know, it hit me.
      She would be perfect
        at doing Elvira.
       She's got the same
     sort of vocal cadence.
      - You know, the fact
     that everybody's like,
     oh, you look like this,
       you look like this
means probably who she really is
      isn't coming through.
  - I think Fortune brought up
       such a good point.
  She doesn't know who she is.
            - At all.
  - She knows she's a cute girl
  and can wear pretty clothes.
             - Yeah.
   - But there's nothing more
         than that yet.
      - All right. So let's
     move on to Peppermint.
             Tonight
      she was really funny.
    - Not only was she funny,
     but she looked probably
  the best we've ever seen her.
        She was literally
       a smiling assassin.
      - Really, seriously.
   From the hair, the makeup,
  the gown, to the funny jokes,
        I really, really
          enjoyed her.
    Like, she was really the
 highlight of the evening to me.
       - Alexis Michelle,
         the Green Mile.
           [all laugh]
     - For to come out here
   with her whole body green,
        I was just trying
      to figure out, what?
         Who in the hell
       left the gate open?
    You know what I'm saying?
    Like, what we gonna get?
    - It was a long way to go
      for a one-word joke.
  Michelle doesn't like green,
     so I painted my body--
       except for my feet.
           [all laugh]
     It just was misguided.
             -Yeah.
           -Confused.
   I actually drew a picture,
  look, on my notes, of a bomb.
       - Oh, my goodness.
          - But we know
       what Alexis can do
    because she has delivered
       in the<i> Snatch Game,</i>
         as Kris Jenner.
         - But she chose
    this position to go last.
       That's a big swing,
     and it was a big miss.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
    Shea Coulee, you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
         - Sasha Velour,
      you're smarty, arty,
          and tonight,
      you turned the party.
   Peppermint, we finally got
 a taste of the real Peppermint,
        and we loved it.
           Peppermint,
       con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
             - Aah!
    - You've won a five-year
  membership with Squarespace,
  which includes a consultation
     with their design team
      for your own personal
    website and online shop.
          - Thank you.
       - And Sasha Velour,
          you're safe.
         The two of you
    may join the other girls.
           [applause]
         Trinity Taylor,
       your barnyard humor
       did not make us go,
         hey, girl, hey.
         Farrah, tonight
        you made us moan,
           but for all
       the wrong reasons.
        Alexis Michelle,
       tonight you proved
   it's not easy being green,
   and comedy is even harder.
        Trinity Taylor...
          You're safe.
            - [sighs]
         - You may join
        the other girls.
     - [whispers] Thank you.
         - Farrah Moan,
        Alexis Michelle,
  I'm sorry, my dears, but you
     are up for elimination.
      - My heart is racing.
  Getting to<i> Drag Race</i> has been
   an eight-year-long journey,
 and feeling like this might be
     the end of that journey
         is devastating.
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
      - I just have to take
    a deep breath and focus,
       because this is it.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.

         My name is Aja.
       I'm 22 years old.
   I had to think about that.
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
        [music playing]
       I got my drag name
    from a Bollywood movie.
       I don't know what
      it's called, but it
      had that little song
    that was like, (SINGING)
       Jamie, Jamie, Aja.
  And I was like, I like that.
     And I absolutely have
     no idea what it means.
         But I like it.
   I'm known for doing things
  that other people don't do.
    Not in terms of my drag,
     but just in terms of I
   will call everyone out and
    always speak the truth.
          That's good.
       I went to church.
      They always tell you
     God don't like liars.
And I will not lie to your face.
     So don't ask me if you
     look bad because I'll
     tell you you look bad.
    I'm just a crazy person.
 I'm crying now on the inside.
   I'm not really competitive
     at all, to be honest.
   I just really like to have
  fun and I'm kind of a joker
and I like to joke with people.
   And sometimes, at people.
So I hope nobody gets mad at me.
   My drag aesthetic is very
 much like slutty, anime girl,
   but also kind of ratchet.
 She's from Brooklyn so she has
  to uphold that hood status.
        My look is very
      Judy Jetson hooker.
   And I'm just very inspired
 by Gautier meets Mugler meets
  furry monsters, but pastel.
      Season 9 is going to
     be, I don't even know.
    These bitches are crazy.
   My name is Alexis Michelle.
I am 33 years old and I was born
  and raised in New York City.
   When I'm not dressed like
this, my name is Alex Michaels.
    So I decided to feminize
      my name since Alexis
   is really my female half.
    Alexis Michelle is known
     for her theatricality,
     her lip sync talents,
        her live vocals,
   and being pretty thirsty.
 I am a fierce competitor, but
  I also know that my biggest
     competition is myself.
       So I don't need to
       tear anybody down.
   I can lend you something.
      I can help you out.
   And still be able to beat
     you, like a good girl.
     I'm a good girl, I am.
         I am all about
      body, curve, swerve,
    glamour, class, a little
      touch of prostitute,
    and of course, this mug.
 When I decided to go with this
  bright vibrant neon yellow,
       I said, I want to
        feel structure.
    I want to feel my shape.
    Alexis is known for her
  cinched waist and her hips.
     So I wanted to really
        bring that out,
     but elevate it to more
       of a high fashion,
  almost McQueen-esque place.
 I can sit down at that makeup
   table and think, oh, god,
here we go again, another face.
  And then something happens.
     As the shapes start to
   come out, as the contours
     pop, as the lashes go
     on, as I pout my lips.
      Something comes over
    me and all of a sudden,
      Alexis has arrived.
     Hi, I'm Charlie Hides.
  I'm from Boston and London,
  and I'm [coughs] years old.
         I'm bicoastal.
   I'm a transatlantic dame.
  My side hustle is I'm a butt
   double for Britney Spears.
  How did I get my drag name?
 It's the name on my passport.
         So inventive.
           Creative.
Pushed the boat out on that one.
   I'm known for, apparently,
        being the oldest
   drag race contestant ever.
Why did I audition for the show?
      Because I'm so old.
    If I don't do it now, by
  next year, I could be dead.
 I'm so old, my ears are still
   ringing from the Big Bang.
     What I do to transform
    is I take lots of makeup
       and I throw it up
     into the ceiling fan.
       I get under it and
       hope for the best.
         My drag look?
       Eclectic, lots of
       different things.
       It's high fashion.
      I'm a crafty queen.
     What inspired my look
     today was Julie Newmar
      meets Philip Treacy.
   An inspiration for me is,
  if I wake up in the morning,
  I think this is a good day.
   Let's make the most of it.
        Let's have fun.
        Let's look good.
 Let's make a few people laugh.
     And if I can get paid
    for it, all the better.
       I want to be known
         for the person
 that when someone was feeling
    bad or had a rough day,
  they saw one of my shows and
   it made them feel better.
     I'm a team player, so
      I work with my team.
And when it's my time to shine,
   I sparkle, Neely, sparkle.
    Season 9 is going to be
     the best season ever.
     You heard it from me.
      Don't quote me, but
        I'm pretty sure.
       My name is Eureka.
      I come from Johnson
        City, Tennessee.
     I am 25 years old and
    I am big, ready to jig,
   and ready to win this gig.
  I actually got my drag name,
  my mother's name is Eureka,
but it's spelt the German form.
 She's from Germany and I just
  looked at my vacuum cleaner
    and was like, Americans,
     will be able to spell
   that out and sound it out.
      So I became Eureka.
     Eureka's really known
       in her profession
 as someone who is high energy,
  very smiley, very positive,
  but also is a dancing queen.
       I like to push the
    boundaries and the molds
        that the bigger
   community has been given.
   I like to wear things that
  we're not supposed to wear.
 I like to have the shape that
  we're not supposed to have.
    And I like to dance hard
    and do things that they
 don't expect a big girl to do.
    She's just big and loud
      and crazy, but fun.
She's going to entertain you on
 and off the stage, regardless.
        It's who she is.
      I'm a perfectionist,
         so everything
has to be perfect at all times,
   especially aesthetically.
  And it can cause me to be a
  little introverted at times,
 and sometimes a little snippy.
     So the bitches better
      watch out, because I
 might cuss, cut, or eat them.
       If I was going to
     describe my aesthetic,
  I would say the Kool-Aid man
  meets Eureka's castle meets
  Hobby Lobby meets the Grand
    Duchess meets Mary Queen
  of Scots meets fabulousness.
    Today, I am inspired by
     fire and the color red
      because it dedicates
    my passion and my drive
   and the flame that I have
  under my ass for a fat girl
      to finally win this
      [beep] competition.
     My name is Farrah Moan.
       I'm 23 years old.
    Born and raised in Texas
  and now living in Las Vegas.
 My drag name Farrah comes from
 my '70s idol, Farrah Fawcett.
      And Moan comes from,
    well, me being a whore.
  When it comes to competing,
   I am not that competitive.
    I mostly just make sure
    that whatever I'm doing
   is true to what I like and
    what I want to showcase.
     I'm definitely not one
      of those girls that
       compares myself to
     other people or wants
   to be better than anyone.
     I just want to be the
      best me that I can.
       My drag aesthetic
        is on a spectrum
  between fetish and showgirl.
     I think I get a lot of
     my fetishy inspiration
        just from my own
     fantasies and desires.
     And then my old school
  Vegas showgirl feel is just
     from being so inspired
    by feathers and sparkles
  and rhinestones and glamour.
  And just that whole iconic,
  larger than life silhouette.
        My look today is
   inspired by old Hollywood
  meets retro glam, mixed with
  a little bit of the fetishy
    aspect of my aesthetic.
      Season 9 is going to
     be absolutely insane.
         Hi, my name is
       Jaymes Mansfield.
    I'm 26 years old and I'm
   from the Antarctic prison
 known as Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
     [squeals] My drag name
    comes from my birth name
      being James and the
    actress Jayne Mansfield.
   I think I'm best known for
   my YouTube channel, Jaymes
    Mansfield, where I talk
      about hair styling,
        makeup, and even
      drag queen history,
   like I'm making right now.
    I'm a drag foster child.
        I have two drag
     mothers, the first one
      a legendary pageant
      queen of Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin, Rudy D'angelo.
 And the third one, a legendary
 trash queen of West Hollywood,
    the Amazing Ruby Claire.
       My side hustle is
   hairstyling, babysitting,
     and selling cookies at
     the church bake sale.
     I am very competitive.
  I don't take things lightly.
      I will hurt people.
     But I think I'm going
     to play nice this time
  and give the girls a little
    bit before I, you know,
     slash their eyes out.
     I transfer into Jaymes
  Mansfield in one simple way.
 I stand still and spin myself
 around in a circle like Wonder
  Woman and, poof, I'm there.
 My entire look is inspired by
  small children, big dreams,
        and I'd say, my
    puppetry and creativity.
        I'm walking art.
       But not vivacious.
          I'm pretty.
  My outfit was created by my
   wonderful, long suffering
       maid, Mr. Jaymes.
       He stayed up many
      long nights creating
 this look last minute for me,
  and I appreciate him for it.
      My look is inspired
       by, well, I wanted
   to be big in the shoulders
 without having to gain weight.
         So, [squeals].
 Season 9 is going to be mine.
     My name is Kimora Blac.
      I'm 28 and I'm from
      Sin City, Las Vegas.
   I picked Kimora because I
    love Kimora Lee Simmons,
   but she's irrelevant now.
    So obviously, there has
     to be someone younger.
         And that's me.
   But Kimora, no one has it.
    It can't be duplicated.
    Kimora just sounds hot.
   When you hear Kimora, it's
   like, damn, who's Kimora?
      I am your life size
       Barbie, you know?
  Like out of the Barbie box.
   Like I am your rich, hot,
    platinum blonde Barbie.
       Super bronzy, like
     straight guys love me.
       Gay guys love me.
      Drag queens love me.
     I'm a really hot guy.
         Like, I would
      totally date myself.
     Like, this full blown,
  like, beard and, like, hot.
        But then, when I
        get into Kimora,
    it's such a long process
   because I am so perfected.
   Because I cannot go out of
 the house looking like busted.
     And some of the queens
    are kind of like busted.
      So that is like the
    top of my list is like,
   one, you cannot be busted.
      My drag aesthetic is
    just sexy and show girl.
       I've come from the
       city of showgirls.
   My look today was actually
really inspired by this fashion
     designer Marco Marco.
       I love his stuff.
   It's not Marco Marco, but
   it's just inspired by him.
 I had to tint my hair hot pink
 because I bleached it too much
       and the split ends
     were kind of showing.
      So I had to kind of
      go in so real girls
  don't get too jealous of me.
              Hey.
 Well, I am Nina Bo'Nina Banana
Fofana Osama on season 9 Brown.
        And honey, I am
      from South Carolina,
       but I do reside in
      Riverdale, Georgia.
       My first drag name
      was Beata Bitchass.
And then it was Lady Guinevere,
but people couldn't spell that.
       They would call me
        Lady Guinea Pig.
       I was sleeping one
    night and I had a dream.
     And somehow, the word
   Nina was just in my dream.
        I would use that
     name, go to the club.
      Somebody would say,
    come out, Nina Bo'Nina.
       And I'm like, OK.
     If 2 plus 2 equals 4,
    that makes sense to me.
    So that was Nina Bo'Nina
       and I said Brown.
        My aesthetic is
       hard to describe.
   Like really, I don't know
    how to describe myself.
  I don't know where I belong.
       I don't want to be
       in a box, either.
        And I feel like
       I'm a black queen
      who does things that
     a lot of black queens
      haven't really done.
  Even a lot of white queens.
      I can give you glam.
      I can give you sexy.
     I can give you crazy.
  I can give you a character.
    It's whatever I choose.
    I just don't want to be,
    like, a one-note queen.
     What inspired today's
    look was grape Kool-Aid.
         No, seriously.
      What does-- a video
        game, actually.
         A video game.
        I'm a big video
      player, I'm a nerd.
           I'm a guy.
    So anybody out there who
 plays some PlayStation, honey,
          bring it on.
      And in the game, you
       get to make your--
   build your own characters.
   And there was this badass
      purple alien bitch.
  And I was like, cheekbones,
     lips, eyes, that's me.
Kiddies, tune in because season
  9 is going to be surprising
    and you are not going to
   know what to expect, baby.
         So get ready.
           My name is
     Peppermint and I'm 37
 years old from New York City.
  I got my drag name because I
  was sitting in a parking lot
        with this guy I
    totally had a crush on.
  And I was eating my favorite
candies, which are peppermints.
       And he just said,
      you know, you should
   call yourself Peppermint.
   I honestly would have done
anything he said, and so I did.
     Peppermint's my name.
           It stuck.
        I've been doing
       drag for so long.
 And I have done lots in drag.
    I've done lots of shows.
   I've done lots of people.
       I've done it all.
      And I really wanted
    something new, something
    that challenged myself.
And I think this is the perfect,
   perfect place to do that.
    My aesthetic is classy,
      chic, uptown flair,
   very urban, with a little
   bit of sex pot thrown in.
        Today's look, my
        hair is inspired
   by RuPaul herself from her
 "Ho, Ho, Ho" Christmas album.
       I think this is ho
     number two, this hair.
    And I just wanted to do
 something fabulous and flowy.
  And I'm giving a little bit
  of Endora from "Bewitched."
       I want to be known
       for the confidence
        that I have with
        my drag being as
  equal to the confidence that
  I bring to my everyday life
   as a trans woman and win.
 The first transgender winner.
       That sounds great.
    Season 9 is going to be
     epic because I'm here.
         I'm a legend.
        I'm fierce, I'm
    fabulous, and I'm ready.
    My name is Sasha Velour.
     I'm 29 years old and I
  live in Brooklyn, New York.
       My drag name is my
      actual name, Sasha.
       That was the name
        I was born with.
       And my whole life,
    I've had people tell me
    that it's a girl's name.
   So the logical conclusion
   is just to become a girl.
       Velour is a cheap
       imitation fabric.
   It's more useful and more
    affordable than velvet.
      So I think it's the
   perfect metaphor for drag.
   I'm an intense competitor.
         I love to win.
        I love to take a
    challenge and transform
   it to really work for me.
      And I'm excited for
       this competition.
      To transform into my
     fabulous drag persona
     is about the physical
   ritual of painting my face
   and costuming my body and
    shaving off all the hair
 and strapping everything down.
       That ritual really
     does help me transform
into this fabulous being that's
so much more than just my body.
       It's my ideas and
        my imagination.
  I think that drag is the art
 form of the queer imagination.
    So it's all about beauty
    that goes beyond gender.
   It's about experimentation
          and remixing
    and combining different
elements from different places.
  So it's just a hodgepodge of
  different fabulous and queer
      things that I love.
        Today's look is,
     like, '60s meets '20s.
         It's a bit of
      Philip Treacy, it's
 a bit of crazy, bald club kid.
      And it's my absolute
 favorite colors, red and pink
   and everything in between.
       Season 9 is going
      to be revolutionary.
    Hi, my name is Shea, Miss
    Coulee if you're nasty.
     I'm 27 years young and
    I'm from the Windy City.
     I got Shea because my
      middle name is Shea
       and in Swahili, it
      means beautiful boy.
       And I thought that
      that was appropriate
     and so I picked Coulee
   because I wanted to sound
   like a French supermodel.
  I'm gorgeous, I'm talented,
    I can sew, I can dance,
     I can act, I can sing.
       I can put my legs
        behind my head.
      I can speak French.
       You know, the list
        goes on and on.
     I'm known for being a
    really strong performer.
  I'm known for having a very
    editorial image online.
        I love fashion.
        I love clothing.
        I love modeling.
      And yeah, girl, I'm
    just sickening the house
    down, boots, Gaga, yes.
     My aesthetic is equal
    parts bougie and bangi.
      I woke up like this.
       So I mean, I just
  literally rolled out of bed
  and then walked my beautiful
   little black ass over here
     and sat in this chair.
         What is drag?
     I just wanted to give
      you African goddess
   realness, Queen Nefertiti.
Yeah, I just wanted to give you
  a really good visual of what
    a true queen looks like.
         Up until this
     competition, I always
 downplayed myself in order to
  make people feel comfortable
      and less threatened.
But now that I'm here, frankly,
 my dear, I don't give a damn.
So these girls better watch out.
       Season 9 is going
      to be unforgettable.
     Hi, I'm Trinity Taylor.
       I'm 31 years old.
      I'm originally from
      Birmingham, Alabama.
       And now, I reside
      in Orlando, Florida.
     I really liked Trinity
       from "The Matrix."
        She was a bitch.
 She had a strong personality.
       She a strong look.
     And at the time, I was
    like, I want to be her.
    And so I would wear jet
 black hair with no hair line,
         just horrible.
      Looked like a brick.
But that's who I thought I was.
             Yeah.
     I come from pageants,
    so I'm very competitive.
      I came here to win.
So that's what I'm going to do.
       I'm going to claw
       my way to the top.
 Putting makeup on other people
  other than myself for my day
     job is kind of boring
  because it's all like, nude,
     beige, and more nude.
     You know, I like this.
 I like the glam, the glitter,
    rhinestones, big lashes.
  They don't let you do that.
    My aesthetic is fierce.
        I love fashion.
          I love body.
         I love beauty.
          I love hair.
         I love makeup.
 I love to be a transformation.
 I was inspired for this look,
just this is my favorite color.
         I love blues.
  I love teals and turquoise.
 And I was thinking, I want to
be a ferocious futuristic bitch.
I want to be known for the fact
  that I'm very well-rounded.
     That I can sew, that I
   can do my makeup and hair,
       and still be nice
      to these other girls
       and help them out
      and still slay them.
     Because I'm that good.
  Hello, my name is Valentina.
         I live in Los
      Angeles, California,
     and I'm a little girl.
    My drag name came about
   it, it just like, snapped.
         It came to me.
  It sounded like a character
 out of a Pedro Almodovar film.
      It sounded like the
 protagonist from a telenovela.
       There's actually a
    salsa called Valentina.
   And also, I love Valentino
  and the color Valentino red.
    So I felt like Valentina
     was the perfect name.
 I'm glamorous, I'm Latina, I'm
 tall, I'm skinny, and luxury.
         I love luxury.
  And I'm a perfectionist and
    I strive for perfection.
         It's something
       that's impossible,
but why not shoot for the stars?
       Getting into drag,
        I have a ritual.
 Getting in drag, the process,
     it's my favorite part.
    So I turn on my candles,
       I put on my music.
      I sip on a glass of
     wine and I just paint.
        And I enjoy it.
      And I take a really
    long time getting ready.
      I love to luxuriate
         in the moment
     and really get excited
   when it comes time to put
   my blush or my lip gloss.
        And now lashes.
      And girl, put those
     contacts on and, boom,
  the transformation is ready.
      I love to get ready.
 It's my favorite part of drag.
        Today's look is
      referencing Prada's
last season, the spring/summer.
   I wanted to do a neoprene
  and I wanted the color to be
  mint and a [inaudible] coat.
  I'm really going for, like,
   this fantasy of just kind
 of doing a modern take on '60s
 glamour with the spiky lashes
      and the teased hair.
          Get into it.
 Season 9 is going to be drama.

Ladies, you represent
the top and bottom of the week,

00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,900
and now it's time
for the judges' critique.

535
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,903
First up, Katya.

536
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,540
You're like Hawaiian Barbie
airline flight attendant, and I love it.

537

[Michelle] But...

538

I don't know what the fuck happened.

When you're on a live performance,
just keep rolling with it,

541
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,021
because maybe people aren't noticing--

542
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,890
No, we noticed that. We noticed that.

543
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,327
-Next up, Violet Chachki.
-I love your outfit.

544
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:34,465
-[Carson] Her outfit's a little <i>Grease</i>-y.
-Sandy would love that.

545
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:39,304
You were so great in the skit.
It wasn't over the top. It was funny.

546
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,507
I noticed that you take yourself
rather seriously,

547
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,042
but underneath there's a clown.

548
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,711
So I'm waiting for her to come out.

549
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,247
Next up, Miss Fame.

550
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,650
I don't think the look says
"Jet Set Eleganza."

551
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,553
And the jewelry is gonna be
a real bitch at the TSA.

552
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,688
Just a heads up.

553
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,525
You were stiff. Maybe you were
uncomfortable with the choreo,

554
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,595
but that shouldn't be the reason
why you stand out.

555
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,130
We get that you're gorgeous,
you're a model.

556
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,601
Now you have got to loosen up.

557
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,905
Relax. Take your hands off your hips.
Yeah, there you are.

558

Next up, Ginger Minj.

559
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,978
You led your team
to what I think was a victory,

560
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:24,349
but explain to me how this dress says
"Jet Set Eleganza," please.

561
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,418

that Elizabeth Taylor could wear.

-On an airplane?
-Of course.

563
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,057
-On her private jet.
-You have a huge personality

564
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,627
and a great charisma,
and you've got it.

00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,997

I kind of lost you in the safety video,

570
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,311

<i>That caught my eye,</i>
<i>'cause you kept trying to fix it.</i>

572
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,684
I get it. You don't want
something to just be hanging.

573
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,321
I love the big hair,
but it's so heavy in the front.

574
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,424
We can't see anything
that's going on the top part of you.

575
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,695
And you know, the dress,
it's just kind of shlumpy.

576
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,065
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.

577
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,802
You were so alive.
You came out with so much energy.

578
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,837
You stayed in my mind.

579
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,240
I actually thought
you could have done more.

580
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:26,344
I wanted to see you really sit
on their tray tables.

581
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,414
-That's another show.
-Right. Yeah, okay.

582
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,750
-Jet Set Eleganza, I'm not getting it.
-No?

583
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,487
But what I am getting
is wife of the town lawyer.

584
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,692
He's taking you out to dinner, so you go
to Caché, and you get a nice dress.

586
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,632
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,

587
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,834
the judges and I will deliberate.

588
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,772
Just between us frequent flyers,
what do you think?

589
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,643
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Jet Set Eleganza was adorable,

590
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,814
but she completely flubbed the words
on the largest monologue.

591
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,650
But I think she had good attitude.

592
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,251
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>

593
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,421
Everything about her
is super poised and polished.

594
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,858
She grabbed me with her beauty
and her little seatbelt bit.

595
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,728
We got to see
a little glimmer of personality,

596
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,664
but there's so much more
that she's got to let bust out.

597
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,732
[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>

598
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,068
She needs to just let it all hang out,
so to speak.

599
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:29,941
She's so concerned with looking beautiful
that she completely gets lost.

600
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,777
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-[Carson] <i>I didn't know it,</i>

601
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,248
but now I love minj, which I know
is one of the world's great ironies.

602
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,285
-Do you really love minj?
-I love the minj.

603
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,522
Put a little ginger on that,
I could eat it all day.

604
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,091
I love her personality, and she's a star.

605
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,496

Jet Set Eleganza... Meh.

-[Olivia] <i>I feel sorry for her.</i>

607
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,903
She was going for the hair, and I thought,
"Stop, let it go. Take your hand away."

608
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,341
And then her Jet Set Eleganza.
Girl, nobody's sitting on a plane in that.

609
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,511
Everything seems
a little bit flat to me with her.

610
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,714
-Except her ass.
-Except her ass, yes.

[RuPaul] <i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>

612

She upped her camp factor.
I was so happy with her.

613
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,956
That scat performance
was pretty impressive.

614
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:22,660
-Then, Jet Set Eleganza.
-You really hate this one.

615
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,163
It was so regular.

616
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,565
Well, she borrowed the outfit from me.

617
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,534
-Uh-oh.
-[Carson] Wah-wah.

618
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,904
Silence. I've made my decision.

619

Sasha Belle, your performance
was a real departure

624
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,558
but to a destination unknown.

-Thank you.

636

{\an8}Winning means
absolutely everything to me,

637
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,013
{\an8}because it was something
that I was afraid to do,

638
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,684
and not only did I survive it,
I conquered it. It's a big day for me.

639

[RuPaul] Katya, your outfit is a Xana-do.

640

00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,133
- So what's everybody doing?

180
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,667
- I'm doing Wendy Williams.

181
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,700
- Diana Ross.

182
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,467
- How you doing?
- Yes.

183
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,567
- I'm doing Gaga.

184
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,567
- What about you, Kenya?

185
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,433
- Beyoncé.

186
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,367
- No, I'm--no.

187
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,200
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what she's thinking.</i>

188
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,266
<i>I love Beyoncé,</i>
<i>but she's not funny.</i>

189
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,667
I'm scared for her.

190
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,734
- Well, may the best woman win.

191
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,600
- I really want you to have
my phone call.

192
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,700
- Are you sure you want
to do that?

193
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,400
Because I feel funny about it,
Phi Phi.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,533
- Honestly, I really wanted
to win it for you.

195
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,767
- Honey, thank you so much.

196
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,066
- Yeah.

197
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,400
-<i> I'm really excited</i>

198
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,734
<i>that Phi Phi's gonna give me</i>
<i>her phone call.</i>

199
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,734
It was really unexpected,
and it was really sweet.

200
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,066
I owe you a big one, girl.

201
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,100
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

202
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
- You're my sister.

203
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,266
- See, you're not
a complete bitch.

204
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,767
[laughter]

205
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,066
- Who are you doing?

206
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,934
- Well, I'm doing, uh,
Michelle Visage.

207
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,066
[laughs]

208
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,633
Vintage Cache!

209
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,967
[laughs]

210
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,633
<i>I thought it would be memorable</i>

211
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,066
<i>poking fun at one</i>
<i>of the judges.</i>

212
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,233
<i>I think a lot of the girls</i>
<i>wouldn't go there.</i>

213
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,900
When in doubt, freak 'em out.

214
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,834
<i>Too much?</i>

215
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,734
Miss Michaels,
is it too much for her?

216
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,200
- Oh!

217
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,567
- [laughs]

218
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,333
-<i> Sharon is doing</i>
<i>Michelle Visage,</i>

219
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,800
which, I mean, that's not
a smart idea at all.

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,066
- Hilarious.

221
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,934
-<i> Now finally the judges</i>
<i>are gonna see</i>

222
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,767
<i>that she clearly has no talent.</i>

223
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,066
<i>Sharon should just pack up</i>
<i>and go home.</i>

224
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,333
Bye.

225
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,133
- Don't push it too far
where you're gonna insult them.

226
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,600
<i>Girl, she's gonna see this.</i>

227
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,667
- Let her.

228
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,467
- Who are you doing?

229
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,667
- I'm gonna do Diana Ross.

230
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,066
-<i> You are?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.

231
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,100
<i>I mean, I'm used to doing,</i>
<i>like, Donna Summer</i>

232
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,266
and Kelly Rowland and--

233
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,400
you know, and those people
aren't like, "Ah!"

234
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,433
You know, so...

235
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,166
- Yeah, and we're left
with Miss Ross.

236
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
- Right.
[laughs]

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,100
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>is really exciting for me</i>

238
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,100
because my drag is sort of based
around characters

239
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,567
<i>and impersonations.</i>

240
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,467
My plan is to really have fun
with Diana today.

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,633
- Are you nervous this week that
you have to step up your game?

242
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,200
Like, the judges have their eye
on you?

243
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,633
- Maybe, but I choose Beyoncé
because it's more easy for me

244
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,567
doing that character
because I know it.

245
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,467
- You don't think, like, doing,
like, a Latin character

246
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,734
would work in your benefit?

247
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:51,100
- I can do Shakira,
but I don't like the character.

248
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
- I have the wig
if you want to do it.

249
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,166
- Yeah.

250
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,100
- I just hope that they get
funny from it.

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,567
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah.

252
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,400
-<i> Kenya'd be my sister</i>
<i>in how close we are.</i>

253
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,500
<i>I am worried.</i>

254
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,266
I wanted her to do something
with an accent

255
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,233
so that way,
it wouldn't be a handicap.

256
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,166
Beyoncé's not really funny,
you know.

257
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,066
She takes her career
really seriously.

258
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,600
<i>So I don't know how Kenya's</i>
<i>gonna make it happen.</i>

259
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,834
- Okay, we are what?

260
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,100
- Pretty sisters.
- Thank you.

261
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,133
- Well, Beyoncé and Gaga
should sit next to each other

262
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,133
on the...

263
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,667
- Yeah, I need to share it.

264
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,500
- Maybe I'll let you use
my telephone.

265
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,367
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,400
- I'm so excited.

267
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,967
- To think that, you know,
Cher's gonna see you doing this.

268
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,834
- I picked Cher because
it's what I'm most known for.

269
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,333
- You'll clock someone
doing Cher wrong.

270
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,800
They always do it too big.

271
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,767
- Show me one tape where Cher
went, "Oh!"

272
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,200
She never did that.

273
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
That's, like, a stupid thing
that people make up about Cher.

274
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,367
Cher's, like, much more subtle.

275
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,233
Cher's above it all,
you know what I mean?

276
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,033
-<i> I love Chad to death,</i>
<i>but the bitch</i>

277
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,700
likes to talk about Cher
way too much.

278
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
- Cher's got a great sense
of humor.

279
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,367
Cher doesn't give a shit.
Cher is a one-word diva.

280
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,934
- She's gonna drive me crazy.

281
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,500
- I know she's got a great
sense of humor.

282
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,066
- Well, don't you think
this is where

283
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,567
you're gonna run into a problem,
sweetie?

284
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,667
- With what?

285
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,400
- You're too afraid
to make fun of Cher.

286
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,934
- You know, the stakes for me
are very high.

287
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,667
<i>People are expecting me to</i>
<i>bring a certain level of skill</i>

288
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,367
<i>to the table, and I don't want</i>
<i>to screw it up.</i>

289
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:14,767
- Hello, hello, hello.

290
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,467
- Hi, Ru.
- Hello.

291
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,100
- Now, I've come to investigate
a case of identity theft.

292
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,367
- Oh, shit.

293
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,700
- Let's get to it.

294
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,967
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi, Ru.

295
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,467
- I want to know who you're
doing in<i> Snatch Game.</i>

296
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,934
- Um, Gaga.

297
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,266
- Wow, that's a risky choice,
because you know in the past--

298
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,400
- It's been done.

299
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,433
- It's been done,
and the girl who did it

300
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:39,133
wasn't able to convey--
'cause what is her personality?

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,467
- Well, she's always about,
you know,

302
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,433
her fans and monsters
and paws up.

303
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,333
- I know, you're making it
sound very simple,

304
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,066
but I think it may be
a little more difficult

305
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,200
than what you're thinking.

306
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
- Well, I do Gaga a lot,

307
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,633
<i>and I've been hired</i>
<i>all over United States</i>

308
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:53,700
to impersonate her.

309
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,967
- All right.

310
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,433
- I've been recognized a lot
for my Lady Gaga.

311
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,066
<i>So I think Ru is gonna love it</i>
<i>and eat it up.</i>

312
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,834
- All right, get back to work.
- I surely will.

313
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,066
- All right.

314
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,533
Well, hello, Dida Ritz.

315
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,533
- How you doing?

316
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,300
- Oh, well, there you have it.

317
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,433
Do you know enough
about Wendy Williams?

318
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,433
- I do know some things
about her.

319
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,700
- She watches this show,
so you better be on point.

320
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,967
- I hope I am.

321
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,900
- Right, because she's got a few

322
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,100
trademark signature moves
that she does,

323
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,800
but then, inevitably, you have
to be quick on your toes.

324
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,133
- Yes.

325
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,133
- Have you ever heard her
radio show before the TV show?

326
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,133
- The one and only time I've
heard it is when she actually,

327
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,367
I guess, got into an argument
with Whitney.

328
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,900
- Well, let's--
give me a little sample.

329
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,066
I'll play Whitney.
- Okay.

330
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,266
- You play Wendy Williams.
- Okay.

331
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,834
- Uh, yeah, I heard you been
talking about me.

332
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,734
What's that all about?

333
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,400
- Well, first of all,
how are you doing?

334
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,233
- No, I'm doing fine, sister.

335
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,066
God is good.
God is good. God is good.

336
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,400
- God obviously isn't that good.

337
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,967
You've been getting
in a lot of trouble.

338
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,333
- Bobby Brown. Bobby Brown!

339
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,066
- Yeah, Bobby Brown's not gonna
help you right now, honey.

340
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,734
This is you.
How are you doing?

341
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:52,767
How you doing?

342
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,900
- I heard some Wendy in there.

343
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,300
- Yeah, so...
- That's very good.

344
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
- Thank you.

345
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,333
- Commit to the character.

346
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,900
I want to see it bam onstage,
okay?

347
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,233
- I'm gonna make sure I go
as far as possible.

348
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,934
- Good.
All right, get back to work.

349
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,600
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thanks.

350
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,633
Latrice Royale.

351
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,667
Who are you playing?

352
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,800
- Aretha Franklin, baby.

353
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,066
- Oh, of course.
Wow.

354
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:16,233
How are you gonna make her
come to life as a personality?

355
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,500
- Well, you know she's a diva.

356
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,567
I just kind of play off of
what she's done and--

357
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,800
- Yeah, you have to convey
Aretha Franklin

358
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,166
in, really, a few seconds.

359
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,467
- Right.

360
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,266
- And I'm not clear
on how you're gonna do that yet.

361
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,600
- Aretha is not really known
for catchphrases

362
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
and being funny and a comedian,

363
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,233
<i>but she's had</i>
<i>some funny moments.</i>

364
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,767
I'm pretty confident
that I can do this one.

365
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,834
<i>I got this.</i>

366
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,066
-<i> All right.</i>

367
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,133
Well, let's hope
that the risk pays off.

368
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,834
Good luck.
Get back to it.

369
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,133
- Thank you.
- All right.

370
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,100
Little Kenya Michaels.

371
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,734
-<i> Hola.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Who's your character?

372
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,433
- Beyoncé, the queen bee.

373
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:53,700
- I've heard of her.

374
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,533
- I'm trying to do
a sick Beyoncé

375
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,767
that have involuntary movements
that is crazy.

376
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,433
- I see.

377
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,233
<i>It's a risk</i>
<i>because of the accent,</i>

378
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:06,500
and, you know, if you were gonna
do a Latin star,

379
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,967
you would have a little bit
of an advantage.

380
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:13,367
- Beyoncé is a girl
that is very sexy girl.

381
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,567
- Yeah.

382
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,633
[both laugh]

383
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,066
I feel good in this.

384
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,867
- You're gonna do Beyoncé,
and you're taking a risk.

385
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,133
I hope it pays off for you.

386
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,300
- I'm gonna work it out.

387
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,066
- All right, get back to work.
-<i> Thank you.</i>

388
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,066
-<i> Thanks.</i>

389
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,700
Hey, Willam.
- Hi.

390
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,767
- Who do we have here?

391
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,967
- Jessica Simpson.

392
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,266
- How do you play
Jessica Simpson?

393
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:35,333
- Jessica doesn't understand
jokes much.

394
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,400
She says stupid stuff,
but she just does it

395
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,667
because she doesn't know better.

396
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,300
- I see.
Are you a fan of hers?

397
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,467
- Who?

398
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,166
- [laughs]

399
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,734
All right, Willam, I'm gonna let
you get back to Jessica Simpson.

400
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,667
I cannot wait.
- Thanks, she's sleeping.

401
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,533
- Oh, she's asleep.
Okay, well, let's let her sleep.

402
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,633
Get back to work.
- Bye. Thank you.

403
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,834
- Milan.

404
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,333
- Hello, Ru, how are you?
- Hi, honey.

405
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,834
Ooh, big hair.
Is it Chaka Khan?

406
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,834
- It's gonna be Diana Ross.

407
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,066
-<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>

408
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,567
You know, last week, you found
yourself in the bottom two

409
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,667
as an actor portraying
a character.

410
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,633
How will you convey
your character this week?

411
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,567
How will you sell Diana?

412
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,367
- Well, I think, um, I was
taking it too small, you know,

413
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,600
and I need to just--
it's better to tell someone

414
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,800
to pull you back,
and hopefully I won't go so far

415
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,867
that it's like a true
caricature.

416
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,266
- And you got to make her funny,

417
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,266
'cause<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is about</i>
spontaneity and humor.

418
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,533
- Okay.
- All right, Milan, get to it.

419
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,934
- Thank you.
- All right.

420
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,066
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>

421
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,233
- Hey, RuPaul.

422
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,834
- Now, who on Earth could you
possibly be playing?

423
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,367
- My main lady, Cher.
- Cher.

424
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,767
- Yes, sir.
- Wow.

425
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,333
- Honestly, Ru,
everything in my life

426
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,700
has been because of Cher--

427
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,300
I mean, all the places
I've gotten to go,

428
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
the people I've gotten to meet,
the clothes on my back,

429
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,333
and I'm really looking forward
to doing her the justice

430
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,133
that she has done for my life.

431
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,967
I basically just owe her
everything.

432
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:01,767
So it's really important to me
not to offend her.

433
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,567
- [imitating Cher]
All right, I'll see you later.

434
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,567
-<i> All right, babe.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, my God.

435
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,400
- Thanks, Ru.

436
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,567
- Sharon Needles.
- Hello, Ru.

437
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,767
-<i> Who are you portraying?</i>

438
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,934
- I'm not sure
if you know her at all,

439
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,767
but I'm doing, um,
Michelle Visage today.

440
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,500
- Oh, well, you know
you're supposed

441
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
to be portraying a woman.

442
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,367
- Oh, yes, I know.

443
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,400
This is gonna be
a little difficult for me,

444
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,367
but, uh...

445
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:23,700
- We say that with love,
of course.

446
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,767
- Yes, of course.

447
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,767
- What mannerisms of hers
are you gonna--

448
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,433
- I'm just gonna bring
a lot of harsh vocals

449
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,166
with a Jersey sense,
a lot of cackling.

450
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,600
[laughs]

451
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,967
This is where I completely
disagree with Santino.

452
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,500
- She's a fierce queen.

453
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,900
And it's quite a risk,

454
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
'cause she's gonna either
love it or read you for it.

455
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,133
- Right, right, right.

456
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:47,233
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous,

457
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,533
but I think I'll do her justice.

458
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,266
- All right, Sharon Needles,
get back to it.

459
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,400
- Thank you.

460
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,767
- All right, ladies, listen up.

461
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,633
At today's taping, you'll be
playing the<i> Snatch Game</i>

462
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,433
with our extra-special
guest judges,

463
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,900
late-night hot potato

464
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,300
- Yay!
- Yes!

465
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,500
- And legendary actress
of stage and screen

466
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,633
and original dreamgirl
Miss Loretta Devine.

467
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,800
[cheering and gasping]

468
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
- Wow.

469
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,467
Loretta is the shit.

470
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,500
<i>She not only acts well.</i>
<i>She sings well.</i>

471
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,533
She's the real deal.

472
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,367
- So don't fuck it up.

473
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,467
Welcome to the new<i> Snatch Game.</i>

474
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,467
[cheers and applause]

475
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:35,300
Hello, I'm your host, RuPaul.

476
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,066
Now let's meet our contestants.

477
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,533
This intern has climbed his way
up the Hollywood ladder.

478
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,533
Please welcome funnyman
Ross Mathews.

479
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,834
<i>I'm so happy you're here.</i>

480
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,100
- Oh, please, I'm thrilled.

481
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,333
- Up next, please welcome
the multitalented--

482
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,066
Loretta Devine is here.

483
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,800
- Hi, Ru.
- Hey, Loretta.

484
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,600
You are a national treasure,
my dear.

485
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,834
- Oh, that's so sweet.

486
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,633
- And now let's give
a Hollywood hello

487
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:04,300
<i>to our star-studded panel.</i>

488
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,333
Now from the best show
on television,

489
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,667
welcome my squirrel friend--
Michelle Visage is here.

490
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:11,667
Hey.

491
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,200
- I might not be
the biggest star here,

492
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,467
but I got the biggest knockers,
okay?

493
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,967
[laughs]

494
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:20,300
- Up next, a great idol of mine,

495
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,734
the one and only Diana Ross.

496
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,266
- Yes, Ru, mwah, mwah.

497
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,533
I love you.

498
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,433
But call me "Miss Ross."

499
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,400
- Milan's makeup looks crazy.

500
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,600
I've never seen Diana Ross
look like she's cracked out.

501
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,700
- Next to her is singer,
actress, shoe designer,

502
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,834
entrepreneur Jessica Simpson.

503
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,133
- You won.

504
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,066
- Oh, she's got a piece
of her product hair there.

505
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,166
- It's synthetic.

506
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,066
You can use it to Swiffer
and everything.

507
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,100
-<i> Oh, okay.</i>

508
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,734
Very good pitch there.
Very good pitch.

509
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,467
- You're welcome.
-<i> You're welcome.</i>

510
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,166
- [laughs]

511
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:59,433
- Let's give some R-E-S-P-E-C-T
to the queen of soul,

512
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:00,734
Miss Aretha Franklin.

513
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:01,867
- So glad to be here, Ru.

514
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,600
- What is that you're eating
over there?

515
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,633
- Something that really
satisfies me.

516
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,100
- Oh, okay.

517
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,133
Did you bring enough for
everyone to share, Re-Re?

518
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,166
- Oh, no, baby, I don't share.

519
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,200
-<i> Oh, she don't share.</i>

520
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,500
<i>All right, all right.</i>

521
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,934
Straight from the<i> Jersey Shore,</i>
Snooki is here.

522
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,066
- Hi, Ru.

523
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,734
Ross, are you a juicehead?

524
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:19,767
- I could try it.

525
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,600
- Oh, my God, I want to smoosh.

526
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,934
- Okay!

527
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,767
- Next to her, the one and only,
the mother of all monsters,

528
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,266
Lady Gaga is here.

529
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,700
- Work it, girl!

530
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,200
Give a twirl!

531
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,100
Give a twirl, give a twirl,
give a twirl!

532
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,266
- Next to her,
the queen of all media,

533
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,066
<i>Wendy Williams is here.</i>

534
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,700
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

535
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,867
- How you doing?
It's nice to see you again.

536
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:48,934
- We've got 16-time
Grammy winner, hey, Beyoncé!

537
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:51,367
- Whoo!

538
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:55,667
- She's had a top ten hit
in every decade since the '60s.

539
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,200
<i>She's done it all.</i>

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,533
The original dark lady,
Cher is here.

541
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,967
- I've been there, done that.

542
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,867
I spread La Mer on my toast
in the morning.

543
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:06,934
All right, you know,
I'm Cher, bitch!

544
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:08,033
[laughter]
Ooh.

545
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,700
-<i> Yes, you are.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- I don't care.

546
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,300
Ross, Loretta, I ask a series
of questions.

547
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,700
Our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.

548
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,200
<i>You come up with an answer</i>
<i>that you think</i>

549
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,667
<i>will match our celebrities.</i>

550
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,400
First question
is for Loretta Devine.

551
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,233
Ugly Edna is so ugly,

552
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>when she goes</i>
<i>to the beauty parlor,</i>

553
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,633
they beat her face with blank.

554
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,500
- A picture of herself.

555
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,767
- Let's see if we can get
a match.

556
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,734
Michelle Visage.

557
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,266
- All right, Ru, I said
a baseball bat.

558
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:42,266
Remember, it was '87, we used to
take the J train into Manhattan,

559
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,600
and you used to carry
a baseball bat

560
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,567
before we would work
Susanne Bartsch's party.

561
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,633
We'd make a buffalo nickel
for it,

562
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,934
and it was all we used
for protection.

563
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:54,200
- No match, Michelle,
but a very good effort.

564
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,333
Thank you very much.

565
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,867
All right, Wendy Williams.

566
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,033
- How you doing?

567
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,400
- Ugly Edna, beat her
in the face with?

568
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,900
- I love Cher, and I'm gonna say
with Cher's plastic surgeon,

569
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,166
'cause look at Cher.

570
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,834
- Allegedly.
Allegedly.

571
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:06,934
- She looks good, I mean--

572
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,533
- Cher, I love the hair change.

573
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,934
- Thank you, I can't go five
minutes without switching a wig.

574
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:14,266
I love 'em. I love 'em.

575
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,734
- Sasha Fierce.

576
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,200
- I want to take a sleepy
right now.

577
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,967
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

578
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,066
- How's she doing?

579
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,934
[laughter]

580
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:25,233
- I'm a survivor!

581
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,333
I'm a survivor!

582
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,467
- She's a survivor.

583
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,967
-<i> Kenya is taking it</i>
<i>to the extreme.</i>

584
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,900
- Oh, girl.

585
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,934
- So I need to step up my game.

586
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:37,867
It's just I don't want to be
flatlining.

587
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,900
-<i> Ross Mathews, you are next.</i>

588
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,400
The real housewives are so fake,

589
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,266
when they make whoopee,
their blanks don't move.

590
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,133
- Their Goldbergs don't move.

591
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,500
-<i> Very funny.</i>

592
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,800
All right, let's go to Snooki
from the<i> Jersey Shore.</i>

593
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,266
- Just like my friend JWOWW,
her tits don't move.

594
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:57,133
-<i> Her tits don't move.</i>

595
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,333
Beyoncé?

596
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,467
- Wake up.

597
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,200
-<i> Oh, is Beyoncé asleep?</i>

598
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,533
Beyoncé, were you sleeping?

599
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,700
- It's the medication.

600
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,834
-<i> That's no excuse.</i>

601
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,600
You should have seen
what me and Ru were on

602
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,066
at the Limelight.

603
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,333
<i>It's all behind us now.</i>

604
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,333
We were on uppers, downers,
and candy corn.

605
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,200
- [laughs]

606
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,633
All right, Cher, I see
you're wearing your Academy--

607
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,066
well, actually, you did not win
the Academy Award that year.

608
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,567
- I didn't, but I'm wearing
the shit out of this headpiece.

609
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,166
I paid a lot for it, so...
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

610
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,467
- Those girls are real sleazy.

611
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,834
Their scabies, crabs, and fleas
don't move.

612
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,667
- I'm afraid that's not
a Goldberg, Ross.

613
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,734
- No.

614
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:35,066
- Loretta Devine,
Fatty Patty is so fat,

615
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:39,367
when she gets on the scales,
it says blank.

616
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:40,600
- Ouch, ouch.

617
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,133
- Ouch!
Good answer!

618
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,333
What'd you say, Michelle?

619
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,266
We have a match?

620
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:48,066
- I said, "Hello,
Madame LaQueer."

621
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,233
- [laughs]

622
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,900
I told her not to wear green.

623
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,333
I hate it!

624
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,300
- Diana Ross, the boss.

625
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,633
- When she got on that scale...

626
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,266
- Yes.
- It said mahogany.

627
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,333
- Ooh.

628
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,800
- The men love me.
The women love me.

629
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,266
They all love me.

630
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,400
-<i> This was a real heavy</i>
<i>Diana Ross.</i>

631
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
This is like Diana Ross
about 4:30 in the morning

632
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,633
<i>after a couple packs</i>
<i>of cigarettes.</i>

633
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:13,100
-<i> Unfortunately that is not</i>
<i>a match.</i>

634
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,867
All right, Jessica Simpson.

635
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:19,200
Fatty Patty's so fat, when she
gets on the scale, it says...

636
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,133
- Oh!

637
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:26,066
- [laughs]

638
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,100
-<i> Oh.</i>

639
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,066
- These young people, see,

640
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,133
they don't have no respect.

641
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:32,333
-<i> No respect.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- No respect!

642
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,900
- This next one is for Ross.

643
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,600
Dumb Dee Dee is so dumb,

644
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,600
she thinks the C word
is short for blank.

645
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,333
- She thinks the C word is
short for Kardashian with a C.

646
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,066
That's how dumb she is.

647
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,600
-<i> That's how dumb she is.</i>

648
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,066
- Stop!
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.

649
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:53,100
Lady Gaga, she thinks the C word
is short for?

650
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
- The crown.

651
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,700
The new diva crown.

652
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,333
Just so you know, the diva here,
not her, not her.

653
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,433
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

654
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:01,467
- But now I have the diva crown

655
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,533
'cause I bought it from her.

656
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,800
- I just want to say
to Lady Gaga

657
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,300
that I am the only boss here.

658
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,100
- I don't even need to fight
my own battles

659
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
when I have my own monsters
to take care of it for me.

660
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,367
Rawr.

661
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,600
- All right, let's move on
to Miss Aretha Franklin.

662
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,166
- Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!

663
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,433
Snooki want smoosh,
smoosh!

664
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,533
Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!

665
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,934
- Oh, how's she doing? Oh!

666
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,934
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my goodness.

667
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:25,066
- The level of
unprofessionalism, far too much.

668
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,433
- [imitates flatulence]
- What did you just do?

669
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,533
Did you just--
- You nasty bitch.

670
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,367
- One more time.
- This is disgraceful.

671
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:36,066
- All right, Beyoncé,
calm your ass down.

672
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,467
- This is worse than when I had
Omarosa on my show.

673
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,500
Get off me!

674
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,066
- Stars, listen up.

675
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,200
Shy Sheila is so shy.

676
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,433
- How shy is she?

677
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,333
- She's afraid to blank
in public.

678
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,367
- Oh.

679
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,066
- Yes, write it--write it down.

680
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,367
<i>Loretta Devine?</i>

681
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:54,066
- She's afraid to swallow.

682
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:55,834
- Swallow in public.
- Yes.

683
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,500
- 'Cause she's shy.
- Shy.

684
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,867
- I have a very shy gag reflex
myself.

685
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,066
[laughter]

686
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,767
Aretha Franklin,
you still down there?

687
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,900
- Mm-hmm.

688
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,667
- Uh-huh, your blood sugar's
going down?

689
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,567
- I don't got any more food.
-<i> You don't have any more food.</i>

690
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,400
- No more snacks.
I can't be bothered.

691
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,767
I am completely over the fuckery
that was going on

692
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,700

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,100
-<i> Cher.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes, Ru?

694
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
- We're looking for swallow.

695
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,934
- Shy Sheila is so shy
that she's afraid to...

696
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't give a rat's ass
because this game

697
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,333
is boring the shit out of me.

698
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:29,567
I don't know why they book me
on these chicken shit gigs.

699
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,700
[laughter]

700
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,467
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.

701
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,533
- Yes, you are.

702
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,433
Yes, you are.

703
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,967
Unfortunately, we've run
out of time.

704
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,867
<i>Now, on behalf of all</i>
<i>our stars,</i>

705
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:43,400
don't forget to spay and neuter
your neighbor's pets.

706
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Thanks for joining us
on the<i> Snatch Game.</i>

707
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
See you next time.

708
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,233
Bye.

709
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,100
- There is such a thing
as going too far,

710
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,967
and it's unfortunate.

711
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,867
- I'ma gonna win!

712
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,066
I'm gonna win.

713
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,433
- You're not getting shit.

714
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,633
- Miss Cheesecake.

715
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:07,767
-<i> This morning, I'm still</i>
<i>feeling very emotional,</i>

716
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,967
very heavyhearted, angry,
disappointed.

717
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:15,800
I've never been so embarrassed.

718
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,867
The<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was horrible.</i>

719
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,066
I felt like it was
a three-ring circus,

720
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,300
romper room bullshit going on.

721
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,533
- So what happened yesterday
at<i> Snatch Game,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girls?</i>

722
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:27,934
- Yeah, what the hell
did happen?

723
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,600
It got a little crazy.

724
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,834
- I thought that<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
was the most romper room fuckery

725
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:39,467
that I've ever experienced
in my life.

726
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,500
I could not believe
the shenanigans

727
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,467
that was going on
in the front row.

728
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,600
Completely unprofessional.

729
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
Completely childish.

730
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,100
And that is not what I came here
to do.

731
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,800
- I don't know where
my character went.

732
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,367
It started off right,
and I don't know what happened.

733
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,500
Did I make a mistake?
Yes.

734
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,100
- Well, it wasn't just you.

735
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,133
Even though Jiggly apologized,

736
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:06,467
I don't even think she was
the worst of the bunch.

737
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,433
- We know that nobody did
anything out of malice,

738
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,367
but everybody
wants the spotlight.

739
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,834
Some of the younger people,
I think,

740
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:16,567
should have been a little more
sportsmanlike about it.

741
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:17,800
- I just want to bitch slap her

742
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
because she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

743
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,800
I mean, at her age,
she shouldn't be such a bitch.

744
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,433
- Well, I think overall we
realize that today is a new day.

745
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,600
Bring your best; deliver what's
needed for this competition.

746
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,333
- Bring our breasts?
- Yeah, bring your breasts.

747
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,300
- Okay.
- [laughs]

748
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,500
- All right, you guys,
I'm gonna go call Adam.

749
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,667
[dialing, line rings]

750
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,600
Hi.

751
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,667
-<i> Hi.</i>
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

752
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,800
- Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.

753
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
-<i> Happy anniversary.</i>

754
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,567
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

755
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,166
- Thank you.

756
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,734
It's just, I feel like I've been
gone forever.

757
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,667
Oh, my God, I miss you so much.

758
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,133
-<i> I miss you too, baby.</i>

759
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,567
- I'm gonna wear the giraffe
bodysuit that you made today.

760
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:00,667
-<i> Fun.</i>

761
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,200
-<i> Being able to talk to Adam,</i>

762
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,333
just knowing that he's still
there thinking about me

763
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,834
and rooting for me,
it was good for my soul.

764
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,066
- I like my Gaga, so that's
all that matters.

765
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,100
I guess because I saw
how some people

766
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,300
were going over-the-top...

767
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,367
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

768
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:16,433
- That I was nervous.

769
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,100
Like, okay, well,
am I not giving enough?

770
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,633
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

771
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,533
- I'm really concerned
about my position here

772
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,500
because I've been consistent
throughout

773
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,834
this entire competition so far.

774
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,066
- This is a problem, girl.

775
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,166
I don't want to go home.

776
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,667
- I don't want you to go home.

777
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,567
- But I'm gonna put that little
wig in my hair today

778
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,900
and go amazing.

779
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,700
- That's all we can do.

780
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
- [laughs]

781
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,834
[applause]

782
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:02,333
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

783
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,533
Hey, guys.

784
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,734
-<i> Hey, Ru.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hey!

785
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:08,266
- Will the real Michelle Visage
please stand up?

786
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,700
- Here I am.

787
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,367
- No, you're not the real one.

788
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:12,567
- I swear!

789
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,800
- [laughs]

790
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,266
Shake the dice and steal
the rice, Santino is here.

791
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,467
- Why so blue, Ru?

792
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,367
- Ross Mathews,
how are you tonight?

793
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,567
- I'm fantastic.

794
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,133
I love you in a feather.

795
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:25,066
- Oh, this old thing.

796
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:26,767
Loretta Devine.

797
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,500
You look like a million bucks.

798
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
- Thank you, Ru.

799
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,300
You look fabulous.

800
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,400
-<i> Thank you.</i>

801
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,066
This week, we challenged
our queens

802
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,700
to give us their best
celebrity impersonations.

803
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Tonight, they've come to the
main stage dressed to impress.

804
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,233
Gentlemen, start your engines,

805
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,734
and may the best woman win.

806
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,934
First up, Jiggly Caliente.

807
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:56,800
Someone's getting lucky
at the prom.

808
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,734
-<i> I am classing it up</i>
<i>in my blue gown.</i>

809
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,333
<i>I feel and look amazing.</i>

810
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,333
-<i> Breakfast at Jiggly's.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

811

<i>Chad Michaels.</i>

813
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,800
-<i> Rawr.</i>

814
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,133
-<i> How many giraffes had to die?</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

815
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,600
-<i> I'm giving you</i>
<i>some giraffe realness,</i>

816
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>and I'm free to just stomp</i>
<i>the runway,</i>

817
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,300
<i>no strings attached.</i>

818
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,367
-<i> I love the peekaboos.</i>

819
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,467
-<i> The peekaboos are fabulous.</i>

820
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,233
-<i> Hello, they're saying hi.</i>

821
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,800
-<i> Milan.</i>

822
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,767
<i>Yes, I can, Janelle Monae.</i>

823
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,633
-<i> Or Bruno Mars on Red Bull.</i>

824
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:35,166
-<i> When I'm on the runway, I feel</i>
<i>like I'm on the tightrope.</i>

825
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,567
<i>And so I really wanted</i>
<i>to embody that essence,</i>

826
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,533
<i>and I wanted to have fun</i>
<i>with that.</i>

827
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,767
-<i> I hope Louis Farrakhan</i>
<i>don't see this.</i>

828
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,633
[laughter]

829
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,934
<i>Oh, Willam.</i>

830
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:47,266
-<i> Leather and lace.</i>

831
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,400
-<i> Damn, girl.</i>

832
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,500
-<i> My safe word is "yes, please."</i>

833
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,700
[laughter]

834
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,967
-<i> My outfit is very</i>
<i>hard-core '90s,</i>

835
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:56,800
<i>Grace Jones,</i>
<i>fetish blow-up doll.</i>

836
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,967
-<i> That's a Tarantino dream</i>
<i>right there.</i>

837
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:03,400
-<i> What are you gonna do,</i>
<i>arrest me for all this ass?</i>

838
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,500
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>

839
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,734
-<i> Is that a shoulder pad,</i>
<i>or is she just happy to see me?</i>

840
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:10,567
-<i> Darling, those are</i>
<i>$25,000 pyramids.</i>

841
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,066
-<i> This is my style.</i>
<i>This is my drag.</i>

842
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,333
<i>This is what I'm known for</i>
<i>and what I like to do.</i>

843
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,734
-<i> Assume the position,</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>

844
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:20,667
<i>Dida Ritz, black Barbie doll.</i>

845
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,734
-<i> Somebody get a dollar.</i>

846
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,400
<i>She got stuck</i>
<i>in the claw machine.</i>

847
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,734
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

848
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,667
-<i> I'm feeling like I am at</i>
<i>a Patricia Field show.</i>

849
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,433
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>my teddy bear skirt.</i>

850
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:32,066
-<i> No animals were harmed</i>
<i>in the making of Dida's skirt.</i>

851
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:34,266
-<i> No. Love a plushy.</i>

852
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,500

<i>Oh, the champion is here.</i>

855

-<i> Boricua!</i>

856
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,333
<i>- Puerto Rico!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

857
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,200
-<i> Boxing is one of the most</i>
<i>important sports</i>

858
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,567
<i>in Puerto Rico, and this</i>
<i>costume represents who I am.</i>

859
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:51,567
-<i> Float like a butterfly,</i>
<i>sting like a queen.</i>

860
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:52,834
<i>Sharon Needles.</i>

<i>After a little lunchtime</i>
<i>procedure.</i>

-<i> I'm obsessed with people who</i>
<i>have extreme plastic surgery,</i>

863
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,800
<i>and through the art of makeup,</i>

864
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,533
<i>I can temporarily be</i>
<i>that Janice Dickinson</i>

865
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,066
<i>or that Amanda Lepore.</i>

866
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,333
-<i> Yes, just a little bit more.</i>

867
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,600
- Oh!
-<i> Oh, oh, oh.</i>

868
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,233
<i>Now it's prefect.</i>

869
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,300
-<i> Just a little prick</i>
<i>in the mouth.</i>

870
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
[laughter]

871
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,533
<i>Oh, Latrice Royale.</i>

872
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,367
-<i> Oh, elegant.</i>

873
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,800
-<i> In royal blue,</i>
<i>and Royale is she ever.</i>

874
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,066
-<i> Yes, bitches.</i>

875
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,734
<i>This is what she's serving,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

876
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:29,100
<i>This royal blue dress</i>
<i>makes me feel</i>

877
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,734
<i>the most beautiful</i>
<i>that I've ever felt, ever.</i>

878
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,834
-<i> I own everything.</i>

879
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,266
-<i> Fabulous.</i>

880
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:37,734
-<i> And those are my girls.</i>

881
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,200
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>

882
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,867
This week, you all snatched
our attention,

883
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:49,700
some for the better
and some for the worse.

884
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,734
When I call your name,
please step forward.

885
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:54,834
<i>Jiggly Caliente.</i>

886
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,066
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>

887
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,266
Latrice Royale.

888
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,633
You're safe.

889
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,400
You may leave the stage.

890
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,734
- [mouthing words]

891
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,433
- Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

892
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,400
First up, Chad Michaels.

893
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,667
- Hi, Ru.

894
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:19,100
- The consistency
in your version of Cher

895
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,467
throughout the entire game
was just spot-on.

896
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,633
I was LOL'ing the whole time.

897
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,567
- I really responded
to this animal print.

898
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:28,233
Looks really futuristic,
looks really new.

899
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,767
- I especially love
the yellow hair.

900
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,767
I'm thinking about
getting me some.

901
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:33,700
[laughter]

902
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,967
- It's yours if you want it.

903
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,600
- Thank you, Chad.

904
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,767
Next up, Willam.

905
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,467
- Your Jessica Simpson--
so funny, so perfectly empty,

906
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,834
and you did it in a way
that I think

907
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,066
would make Jessica Simpson
laugh.

908
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,367
- If she could turn her TV on.

909
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,467
-<i> [laughs]</i>

910
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,066
- Willam, let me tell you
why I'm having a problem.

911
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,667
I feel like I don't
know you yet.

912
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,100
I love the way you get onstage.

913
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,667
I love the way
you hold your character.

914
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,934
Now I want to see
what else there is

915
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,867
besides this fierce-body bitch.

916
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,166
- I tend to think that emotions
are for ugly people.

917
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,700
- No!

918
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,900
No, we do have them,
but so can you.

919
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,166
- All right, next up,
Milan as Diana Ross.

920
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,834
- I had trouble with the makeup.

921
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,433
<i>She looked a little cross-eyed</i>
<i>at times.</i>

922
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:20,066
- You just didn't have
the Diana demeanor.

923
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,633
She floats,
you know what I mean?

924
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:23,734
She's like Febreze.

925
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,066
It's just better.

926
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,066
- You were like Chris Rock.

927
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,567
Like, how much it cost
for one rib?

928
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,700
-<i> This ensemble tonight,</i>
<i>I like that you had</i>

929
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,567
so much reverence
for Janelle Monae,

930
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,567
but I see you as a man.

931
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,533
<i>The suit, the pants, even,</i>
<i>the saddle shoes--</i>

932
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,734
it all reads as boy.

933
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:44,467
- Well, I mean,
this is what she wears,

934
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:46,800
and I really want to stay true
to Janelle's look.

935
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,433
- Bottom line, it's still
a drag queen competition,

936
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:51,900
and you're giving us drag king.

937
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,567
-<i> Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>

938
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,600
- The thing about Gaga--
and I'm a huge fan--

939
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,533
<i>is, you picked someone</i>
<i>who's all visual,</i>

940
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,233
and it kind of fizzled.

941
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,433
- I'm not a big fashion icon
or anything,

942
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:07,367
<i>but the shorts seem like it</i>
<i>should have been cut up higher.</i>

943
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:08,967
<i>Yeah, like that more.</i>

944
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:11,233
Those look like old
swimming trunks I used to wear.

945
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,400
[laughter]

946
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,800
- Sharon Needles, tell me about
your runway look tonight.

947
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,867
- You know, I have an obsession
with plastic surgery.

948
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,834
I love to look at people
that have it.

949
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:22,066
I mean, that's why Chad's, like,

950
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>one of my new best friends,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

951
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,400
- Speaking of plastic surgery,
you chose to do Michelle Visage.

952
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,900
- What?

953
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,066
- Now, I'm very excited
to get to Michelle

954
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,533
to hear what she has to say.

955
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,667
- I'm not as old as you wanted
to make me, bitch.

956
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,266
- I have no idea.

957
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,533
- But with that said...

958
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,600
I thought it was brilliant.

959
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,633
Keep doing it.

960
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:42,633
- I just want to say, you know,

961
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,767
thank you all
and I love you all,

962
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,734
and I'm gonna tell you why.

963
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:50,233
[laughter]

964
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,333
- Kenya Michaels.

965
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,834
- Hi, Ru.

966
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,667
- I was very confused
with your Beyoncé.

967
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,500
<i>It was really frantic.</i>

968
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,333
The gyration movements
and the body snaps,

969
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,133
<i>that and the medication,</i>

970
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,967
it just didn't have anything
to do with Beyoncé.

971
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,500
- You're kind of a knockout
tonight

972
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,467
<i>in a little sequin</i>
<i>boxer outfit,</i>

973
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,834
but I worry you KO'd yourself
with your Beyoncé yesterday.

974
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,800
- Okay.
-<i> Thank you, Kenya.</i>

975
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,900
And thank you, ladies.

976
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,533
<i>While you enjoy</i>
<i>an Absolut cocktail</i>

977
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,300
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

978
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,934
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>

979
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,333
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>

980
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,600
All right, judges,
just between us "goils,"

981
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,066
<i>what do you think?</i>

982
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,100
Let's start with Chad Michaels.

983
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,200
- The planning, knowing
that she was gonna change wigs

984
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
and kind of give you
a new version of Cher

985
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,133
all equally funny.

986
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,967
- But I almost feel like
that was safe for Chad.

987
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,533
- It wasn't something safe
for Chad to do

988
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,700
because Chad really had
something to lose here.

989
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,233
You know, a lot of pressure
on Chad, and did he deliver?

990
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,066
Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

991
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,467
- I like what Sharon Needles
did more.

992
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,767
Now, yes, I know she played me,
but...

993
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:58,867
[laughter]

994
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,500
It's got nothing to do
with that.

995
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,066
She didn't think traditional.

996
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,967
<i>She definitely was not</i>
<i>a suck-up.</i>

997
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:08,467
She made me older and harsher...

998
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:09,600
and cheaper.

999
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,767
- Now that I've actually met
Michelle,

1000
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,367
I think she could have had
more hair,

1001
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,500
greater makeup,

1002
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,567
I mean, bigger tits, even.

1003
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,300
[laughter]

1004
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,800
- Hey, let's talk about Willam.

1005
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,100
-<i> Willam's quite an actress.</i>

1006
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,967
Really committed to the
character of Jessica Simpson.

1007
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,133
It was really funny.

1008
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,834
- I always know
she's gonna throw back,

1009
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>so that's exciting to watch.</i>

1010
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,900
But there's so much under there

1011
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,600
that I don't even think Willam's
ready to let out.

1012
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm not gonna be able
to root for her

1013
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,300
until she shows me that
a little bit.

1014
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,900
- Right, that vulnerability.

1015
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,133
Milan, I had a problem
with the suit.

1016
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,533
<i>If the suit were a woman's</i>
<i>suit, it would be different.</i>

1017
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,367
- I felt like I was watching
Sammy Davis Jr.

1018
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,767
- Uh-oh.
-<i> Okay.</i>

1019
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,700
- That is not what I want to see
in my drag queen.

1020
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,867
- Oh, my goodness.

1021
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:54,934
- Where did Kenya Michaels
go wrong?

1022
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:58,066
- Well, first of all,
she made Beyoncé crazy.

1023
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,066
- What was that Beyoncé?
- I know.

1024
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,433
- It felt very uncomfortable.

1025
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,900
- Maybe she just doesn't have
enough references

1026
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,934
in her repertoire
to pull out something

1027
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:09,066
that's believable and funny
and--

1028
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,300
-<i> That's what drag is about.</i>

1029
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,100
You have to have a knowledge
of pop culture.

1030
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,233
All right, let's talk about
Phi Phi O'Hara.

1031
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:17,233
She took some heat tonight
because of her runway look,

1032
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:21,266
and also her Lady Gaga was
nothing to write home about.

1033
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,066
- It just wasn't good.

1034
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:26,233
- I like her, but she missed
the mark on all counts tonight.

1035
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:29,100
- All right, silence.

1036
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,533
Bring back my girls.

1037
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,200
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>

1038
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,066
I've made some decisions.

1039
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,233
Chad Michaels...

1040
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,600
- Yes, ma'am.

1041
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,166
- This week,
you hit the jackpot, baby.

1042
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:50,133
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.

1045
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,100
- Thank you all so much
for recognizing me.

1046
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,734
It means the world to me.

1047
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:04,734
- Thank you.

1048
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:09,066
Willam, Sharon Needles,
you're safe.

1050
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:18,700
I've never had, like,
girlfriends.

1051
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,500
I've never really been friends
with other drag queens.

1052
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,867
I've always been an actor on TV.

1053
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,667
I was on<i> Boston Public</i><span style="bodyStyle"> with you.</i>

1054
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:30,533
And I'm getting to know these
girls, and they're awesome.

1055
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:32,266
And it sucks to know
that one of them

1056
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:36,467
is gonna have to go home
so I can win.

1057
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:37,734
It's hard.

1058
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:40,834
So yeah, that's it.

1059
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,400
And I'm not acting.

1060
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,300
Swear to God.

1061
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,066
- All right, ladies,
the three of you

1062
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:50,100
may join the other girls.

1063
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1064
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:59,066
- Kenya Michaels,
impersonating Beyoncé

1065
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,834
is not your destiny, child.

1066
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:07,266
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1067
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:10,200
- I feel bad
because I can't believe

1068
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,900
that I go to the bottom two.

1069
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:19,433
- Phi Phi O'Hara, your Lady Gaga
was on the edge of gory.

1070
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:25,533
You're safe.

I'm telling you, Phi Phi,
you better come harder.

1078
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
- I will.

Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,

1081

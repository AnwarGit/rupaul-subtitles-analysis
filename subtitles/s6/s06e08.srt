AND THEN WHOEVER YOU WANT
TO THROW UNDER THE BUS
YOU PUT SECOND.

173
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:56,900
- HA HA!

174
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,333
- THEN YOU PUT ME SECOND LAST
AND YOU LAST.

175
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,633
- THAT'S JUST SHADY.

176
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,066
YESTERDAY YOU WERE SUGGESTING
THAT HER DRAG WAS UGLY.

177
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,433
TODAY YOU'RE TELLING HER
HOW TO DO A LINEUP.

178
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,600
- YEAH, ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,467
- YOU ARE A SHADY CUNT.

180
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,500

THIS BITCH IS
TALKING TO HERSELF.

184
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:39,033
I WAS LIKE, "BITCH, I THOUGHT I
WAS THE CRAZY ONE UP IN HERE."

185
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,734
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE, BENDELA?

186
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,367
- UM, I THINK THAT
I'M GONNA GO WITH

187
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:47,367
SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF MORE
A BLANKET PERSONAL NARRATIVE.

188
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,033
- HA HA!

00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:53,233

- TODAY WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
OUR STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINE

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,166
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.

199
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,967
THIS IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE HARDEST CHALLENGES

200
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,300
OF THE COMPETITION SO FAR.

201
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,066
- ADORE, ARE YOU
GONNA WRITE MATERIAL,

202
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,700
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
WRITE A CARD FOR GUIDELINES

203
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,767
SAYING "COOL, AWESOME, CHOLA,
MY MOM, LIBRA?"

204
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,600
- "PARTY."
- "PARTY." HA HA!

205
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,266
- FUCK OFF.
FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF.

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,033
SHIT.

207
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,133
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JOS?
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?

208
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,100
- WHEN I WAIT TABLES,
LIKE, THAT'S, LIKE,

209
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,533
MY OPPORTUNITY TO BE
A STAND-UP COMEDIAN,

210
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,033
SO I'M ALWAYS CRACKING JOKES.

211
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,166
IF SOMEBODY ORDERS
A JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL,

212
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,000
I'LL SAY, "I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC."

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,367
AND THEY'LL SAY, "TO WHAT?"
AND I'LL SAY, "TO AN OXYMORON."

214
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,300
JUMBO SHRIMP.

215
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,100

- HA HA!

217
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,066
- I KNOW THAT STAND-UP COMEDY

218
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,734
IS NOT MY CUP OF SOUP--

219
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,934

BOWL OF WHAT?

220
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,300
CUP OF TEA.

221
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,900
THIS IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.

222
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,000
HA HA!

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
- WHERE DID--
WHERE DID LAGANJA GO?

00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,600
- I DON'T KNOW.

225
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,934
- LAGANJA, ARE YOU HERE?

226
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,433
OH, OH, WELL.

227
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:21,133
- YES, GIRL. OK.

228
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,066
- I LOVE IT.
SHE'S UNDER THE TABLE.

229
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:26,967
- HOW Y'ALL DOING?

230
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:29,100
- OH, LET ME GET MORE ATTENTION

231
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,367
LIKE THE BIG "NO-SMOKING"
SIGN ON MY HEAD.

232
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,900
LET ME GET UNDER A TABLE.

233
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,033
REALLY, QUEEN?

OR FOR MY LATIN FOLK
IN THE AUDIENCE, LA MARIJUANA.

237
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,000
- I THINK IN THIS COMPETITION

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,834
YOU HAVE TO STAND OUT
AND BE A BOLD CHARACTER.

239
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,433
THIS IS THE PERFECT CHALLENGE
TO SHOWCASE LAGANJA.

240
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,734
HONEY, I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
STONER REALNESS.

241
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:58,300
NOW, GIRL, IF IT AIN'T GREEN,
WELL, GIRL, I'M NOT INTERESTED.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,433
- I NEED A TRANSITION.

243
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,233
- THE JUDGES SAY THAT
I'M HIDING BEHIND A CHARACTER,

244
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,767
BUT I THINK LAGANJA
IS MAYBE THE PERSON

245
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:09,266
WHO'S ACTUALLY AFRAID
TO BE EXPOSED RIGHT NOW.

246
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,133
- HOW YOU DOING, DELA?
- OH, I'M PLUGGING AWAY.

247
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,400
HOW ARE YOU?

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,166
- GIRL, I'M JUST TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,

249
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,133
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE IN A TENT

250
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,900
AND JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY
CHANNEL THAT INNER CHILD.

251
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,266
- OK.

252
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,066
- THIS PERSON IS NOT THE LAGANJA
THAT I KNOW,

253
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,934
AND IT'S FREAKING ME
THE HELL OUT.

254
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,934
- OK?

255
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,367
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

256
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,767
- HI.

257
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:34,367
- HOW ARE MY DRAG QUEENS
OF COMEDY?

258
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,333
- HILARIOUS.

259
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,367
- YUCK-A, YUCK-A, YUCK.
HA HA!

260
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,700
HEY, DELA.
- HI, RU.

261
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,734
- NOW, LAST WEEK
YOU WERE IN THE BOTTOM TWO.

262
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,066
- YES, I WAS.

263
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:46,600
- DO YOU FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BOUNCE BACK FROM ALL THAT?

264
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,467
- I DEFINITELY DO, YEAH.

265
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:51,033
I WAS REALLY DEVASTATED
TO BE DOWN THERE.

266
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,900
- WHAT ARE YOU
THE MOST NERVOUS ABOUT?

267
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,333
- I, YOU KNOW, DON'T HAVE
ZINGY ONE-LINERS.

268
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,567
I CONSIDER MY HUMOR
TO BE VERY CHARACTER-BASED.

269
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,800
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
THE NOTE FROM MICHELLE

270
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,700
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
BECAUSE YOU DO A CHARACTER.

271
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
- YEAH.
- BUT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL

272
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,667
THAT THAT WASN'T COMING THROUGH.

273
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,934
- BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS IS
THE PERFECT CHALLENGE FOR ME

274
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:13,900
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO THAT.

275
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,967
- WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
GET BACK TO WORK.

276
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,567
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.

277
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,800
WELL, HELLO, MISS BIANCA.
- HI.

278
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,934
- EVERYONE'S LOOKING TO YOU
TO BE THE STANDOUT
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

279
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,433
DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

280
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,066
- CONCERNED, YEAH.

281
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,300
- BUT YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.

282
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,367
- BUT FOR ME,

283
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,433
IT'S MORE OBSERVATIONS
AND IN THE MOMENT,

284
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,033
AND I DON'T DO WELL
WITH SITTING DOWN

285
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,133
AND WRITING, "HERE IS A JOKE."

286
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:39,033
- NOW, IN THE PAST, YOU'VE
ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT OF QUEENS
IN THIS COMPETITION.

287
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,000
- YEAH.
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?

288
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,233
- WELL, THEY'RE ALL
HELPING ME OUT

289
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,266
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.

290
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,367
- HA HA!

291
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,567
- AND I'M NOT JUST
A NASTY CUNT.

292
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,633
I WILL HELP THEM PACK
TO GO HOME.

293
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,033
- HA HA!

294
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,200
- I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN
GOT TO FOLD

295
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,433
SOME OF THE SHIT
THEY'RE WEARING.

296
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:53,667
YOU JUST BALL IT UP.

297
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,333
"PUT THAT IN BAG NUMBER 5,
BITCH.

298
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,467
GET TO STEPPING."

299
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,767
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU OUT THERE.
- THANK YOU.

300
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:01,066
THIS CHALLENGE IS REALLY A SHIT
OR GET OFF THE POT MOMENT,

301
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,166
SO LET'S HOPE I CAN DELIVER
A NICE, BIG TURD.

302
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,767
- TRINITY K. BONET,
HEY, MAMA.

303
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:07,934
- HI.

304
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,500
- HAVE YOU EVER DONE STAND-UP
BEFORE?

305
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,767
- NO.
- DO YOU KNOW ANY JOKES?

306
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,934
- UM...

307
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,967
I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT NOW,

308
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:20,767
BUT WHEN I FEEL LIKE, LIKE
I HAVE A MAGNIFYING GLASS
OVER ME OR SOMETHING,

309
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,867
THAT'S WHEN IT GETS HARD.

310
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,934
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

311
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:28,667
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE,
YOUR COMEDY CAME OUT,

312
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:32,900
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT
ALMOST BY HABIT YOU SHUT DOWN.

313
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

314
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,233
IT'S JUST ALMOST SOMETHING
I CAN'T CONTROL.

315
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,233
YOU JUST--
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.

316
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,667
- I KNOW THAT
THERE'S A BLOCK THERE,

317
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,800
AND SO THAT'S FOR YOU TO UNLOCK.

318
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,500
DON'T LET THE MOMENT
PASS YOU BY.

319
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,333
ALL RIGHT, TRINITY,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

320
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:51,066
- RU IS COUNTING ON ME TO
DELIVER SOMETHING THAT HE
KNOW DAMN WELL I CAN'T DO.

321
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,200
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER ROUND.

322
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,166
TO PROVE THAT YOUR COMEDY
HAS A BROAD APPEAL,

323
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:05,767
I'VE INVITED A SENIOR CITIZENS
GROUP TO JOIN US.

324
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:10,734
YES, THEY WILL BE SITTING
FRONT AND CENTER.

325
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:14,500
- I TOLD YOU IT WAS GONNA BE
AN OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW.

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,333
MAKE 'EM LAUGH.

327
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,467
- ANYONE CLOSE TO ME KNOWS
THAT CUNT, BITCH, FUCK,
DAMN, SHIT AND ASS

328
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,000
ARE MY FAVORITE WORDS TO USE.

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,166
HA HA! I'M FUCKED.

330
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,100
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES...

331
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,967
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.

332
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,600
- SO IS ANYONE CURIOUS AS TO
THE ORDER I'VE PUT US ALL IN?

333
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,433
- OOH, YES.
- OH, GOD.

334
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,133
- BECAUSE I WON

VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME.

SHE WAS UP FOR HER FIRST TONY.

382
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,967
THEN SHE OVERHEARD SOME
OF THE OTHER NOMINEES SAYING

383
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,233
HOW BIG OF A JOKE SHE WAS

384
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,700
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO BE NOMINATED

385
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,033
AND THERE'S NO WAY
SHE WAS GOING TO WIN.

386
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,066
AND SHE SAID SHE GOT
REALLY DOWN ON HERSELF

387
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:55,433
AND WENT BACK OUT THERE
COMPLETELY FEELING DEFEATED,

388
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:58,100
AND THEN SHE WON THE TONY.

389
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,367

THAT ARTICLE AND SAYING,

AND GET WORK DONE,

503
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:56,900
SO I NEVER GRASPED THE CONCEPT
TO RESPECT MY ELDERS.

504
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,567
THE BITCH NEVER AGES.

505
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,300
SHE HAS A FAKE ASS
AND A FAKE HIP,

506
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,667
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE ASS
CAME FIRST AND BROKE THE HIP,

507
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,433
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
SHE'S DOING.

508
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,633
BUT ANYWAYS,
MY GRANDMA'S A WHORE.

509
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,734
NO? COOL.
IT'S MY FIRST TIME, PEOPLE.

510
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,900
HA HA! YOU GUYS HAVING FUN?

511
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,300
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

512
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,133
- I'LL MOW YOUR LAWNS LATER.

513
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,266
- MY NAME IS BENDELACREME.

'KAY.

515
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:24,567
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE
WITH A LIVE AUDIENCE.

516
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,600
I LOVE IT WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE
JUST RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

517
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,500
AND I CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN JUST
REACH RIGHT OUT AND TOUCH YOU
IF I WANTED TO.

518
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,166
I DON'T WANT TO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

519
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,133
BUT I FEEL LIKE I COULD
IF I WANTED TO,

520
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,033
WHICH IS A GREAT OPTION TO HAVE.

521
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,734
I'M FAR AWAY FROM MY HOME TOWN
OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.

522
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,500
IT'S THE CITY THAT NEVER DRIES,

523
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,033
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
RAIN IS NOT SO BAD.

524
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:47,500
IT IS A MOIST AREA,
BUT IT'S MY MOIST AREA.

525
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,567
AND I LOVE IT.

526
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME THERE.

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,166
YOU JUST NEED TO WEAR
THE RIGHT PROTECTION, YOU KNOW.

528
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,800
THERE'S A LOT OF STEREOTYPES
ABOUT SEATTLE-ITES,

529
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,133
BUT THEY'RE REALLY JUST REGULAR
FOLK, EXTREMELY REGULAR FOLK.

YOU KNOW, CAFFEINE--
ALL IN LINE FOR THE RESTROOM.

531
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,533
WE LOVE A GOOD REST,
BUT, UM--I DIGRESS.

532
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:12,233
THE POINT IS I FEEL LIKE
I'VE LEARNED TO SORT
OF WEAVE A STORY,

533
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,900
BRING SOMEBODY ON AN ARC
THAT REALLY ENDS SOMEWHERE

534
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,000
WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE
THING'S BEEN MEANINGFUL,

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,066
AND THEY'RE GONNA WIND UP
WITH SOMETHING THAT MADE
THE WHOLE THING WORTHWHILE.

536
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,767
- SO TELL US A JOKE.

537
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,700
- UM, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,066
GANJA'S IN THE HOUSE.
YEAH.

548
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,900
AS YOU COULD TELL
FROM MY ACCENT,

549
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,233
I AM FROM DALLAS, TEX-ASS,

550
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,233
AND IT WAS NOT VERY EASY
GROWING UP LOOKING LIKE THIS,

551
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,500
WHETHER I WAS PLAYING
IN MY GRANDMA'S CLOTHES

552
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,734
OR PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR MY WELL-ORGANIZED,

ALPHABETICALLY-ORDERED

554
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,500
I WAS GA-GA-GA-GAY, OK?

555
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,734
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES

556
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:12,300
THAT I DISCOVERED MARIJUANA.

557
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,700
I MEAN, I LIKE TO SMOKE.

558
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,934
Y'ALL, I AM JUST FLYING AS HIGH
AS YOUR RECEDING HAIRLINE, OK?

559
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,867
MARIJUANA REALLY DOES
HELP ME CALM DOWN.

560
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:25,033
SO, Y'ALL, I WENT TO VALENCIA
WHERE THEY FILM THE
TV SHOW "WEEDS."

561
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,467
NOW, Y'ALL, IT'S VERY DRY.

562
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,233
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF LIKE
YOUR VAGINA.

00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:33,233
CAN I GET A AMEN?

564
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,500
NOW, Y'ALL, I AM A TREE HUGGER

BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY POOR.

WE WERE, LIKE,
"GOOD TIMES" POOR.

IT WAS REALLY, REALLY BAD.

585
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,767
AND THE ONLY WAY WE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT

586
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,100
WAS, MY MOTHER WOULD READ US
RECIPES FROM A COOKBOOK.

587

- [LAUGHTER]

588
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,100

HAPPENED.

A EAR INFECTION,
SO SHE STARVED TO DEATH.

- I REALLY GREW UP A LOT
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.

595

I STAYED AT
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE,

596
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,000
ONE, BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST
A SWEET LADY,

597
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,066
AND TWO, BECAUSE SHE HAD FOOD.

598
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:51,433
BUT SHE HAD THIS REALLY CRAZY
OBSESSION WITH HER BILLS,

599
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,133
AND IT WAS THE LIGHT BILL
IN PARTICULAR.

600
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,300
EVERYTHING INVOLVED
THE LIGHT BILL.

601
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,533

LIKE THAT.

YES.

- YOU KNOW, I'VE SUFFERED
FROM ADHD ALL OF MY LIFE.

IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE
EVERY DAY.

JUST EAT SOMETHING,"

I SEE RuPAUL HERE ON THE RUNWAY
AS A DRAG QUEEN.

MY MOTHER IS FROM CUBA,
AND MY DAD IS FROM HONDURAS,

641
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,900
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I HAVE
A LARGE DICK, NO CREDIT,

642
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,100

THAT DON'T BELONG TO ME.

644

- MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT WE STAY TRUE TO
OUR SPANISH HERITAGE,

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,934
SO MY FIRST WORDS
WERE, "HOUSEKEEPING."

MAKES ME FEEL RIGHT AT HOME.

CAN YOU WAKE THAT BITCH UP?

650
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,367
YEAH, THE ONE RIGHT THERE
WITH THE HORIZONTAL STRIPES.

651
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,734
NOT A GOOD LOOK IN YOUR THIRD
TRIMESTER, SIR, ALL RIGHT?

- [LAUGHTER]

653

- ALL I'VE EVER HEARD
FROM THE JUDGES

654
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,800
WAS THAT WE NEED
TO SEE MORE VERSATILITY.

655
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,300
YOU KNOW WHAT
I GOT TO SAY TO Y'ALL

656
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,166
IS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU
VERSATILITY

- [LAUGHTER]

660
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,133
- AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

661
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,567
WELL, I GOT TO SAY, I HOPE
YOU GUYS HAD A LOT OF FUN,

662
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,934
AND BECAUSE
I'M FEELING EXTRA SPECIAL,

663
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:28,934
I'M GONNA PUT FRESH TENNIS BALLS
ON EVERY WALKER IN THE PLACE.

MWAH.

667
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,166
- COMING UP...

668
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,867

- I THOUGHT YOU DID OK,

686
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,300
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA USE A SHTICK
LIKE A SONG,

687
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,667
THAT SHIT HAD BETTER BE THE
FUNNIEST SONG I'VE EVER HEARD.

- MM-HMM.
- AND IT WASN'T.

WITH THESE OLD SHOWGIRL LOOKS.

MORE ME.

OF THAT CHARACTER

- KNOWING THAT BIANCA DEL RIO
IS A COMIC,

772
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,066
WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF
BEFORE HER?

773
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,266
- I THOUGHT SHE'D BE A GREAT WAY
TO CLOSE THE SHOW.

774
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,667
- SHE IS A GREAT CLOSER,

775
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,133
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS
IT PUTS THE PERSON BEFORE HER

776
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:13,600
IN A REALLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION
IF YOU'RE NOT AS STRONG.

777

ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING.

LET'S START WITH DARIENNE LAKE.

797
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:00,867
- SHE WAS COMFORTABLE
IN HER OWN SKIN.

798
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,467
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.
SHE HAS HEART.

799
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:04,767
SHE PLAYED TO THE AUDIENCE.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GREAT.

800
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:05,767
I LOVED HER.

- COURTNEY ACT.

802
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,133
- I THOUGHT HER ROUTINE
WAS AVERAGE.

803
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,066
- I THINK SHE WAS SMART
TO PLAY TO HER STRENGTH,

804
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,967
WHICH IS HER VOICE AND SINGING.

805
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,934
- BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

806
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,567
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.

807
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:20,166
- SHE'S SUCH AN INTERESTING
PRESENCE ON STAGE.

808
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,767
- IF SHE REALLY GOT RID
OF ALL THAT DOUBT,

809
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,233
SHE WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE.

810
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,834
- THINK OF YOURSELF AT THAT AGE,
YOU KNOW.

811
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,166
- HA! OH!

812
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,133
- TRY TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE
BACKSEAT OF CARS TO TELL YOU...

813
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,900
- [LAUGHTER]

814
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,667
- JUST SLAP THE DICK
OUT OF YOUR HAND

815
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,700
AND SAY, "MICHELLE, LISTEN."

816
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,133
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.

817
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,900
- HER COMEDY WAS INTELLIGENT.

818
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,767
SHE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
COMIC TIMING.

819
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,300
- THE SMARTEST THING SHE DID
WAS,

820
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,533
WHEN THE HECKLER HAPPENED,
SHE GOT OFF.

821
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,467
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

822
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:51,200
- I JUST DON'T QUITE GET
THAT WHOLE CHARACTER

WHO SMOKES DOPE ALL THE TIME

824
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,100
AND YET CAN SPEAK FASTER
THAN THE BULLET TRAIN.

825
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,000
- WHEN YOU GET INTO
A BUSINESS LIKE THIS,

826
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,900
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THICK SKIN.

827
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,166
- YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE CRITICISM.

828
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,200
NOBODY'S SAYING
YOU'RE NOT TRYING, GIRL.

829
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,734
I'M SAYING
IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER.

- YEAH.
TRINITY K. BONET.

831
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,934
- I LOVED THAT SHE LAUGHED
AT HERSELF AND HER LIFE

832
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,834
AND ALLOWED US
TO DO THAT WITH HER.

833
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:15,967
- SHE FOLLOWED LAGANJA,

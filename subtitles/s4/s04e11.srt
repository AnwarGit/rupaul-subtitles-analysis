And what about your wig,
Phi Phi?

It's really pretty,
but haven't you worn that

is not that big,

looked nothing like me.

You're absolutely right.

the worst dog.

She knows that I'm one of
the strongest competitors here,

00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,367
for giving her that bloodhound.

about it.

the other foot,

she would have tried to get us
with her dog decisions.

332

- I didn't do it
to fuck anybody over,

333
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,533
but it's also I fucking won the
challenge, so it's up to me.

as he wants, but I mean,

gonna win this challenge.

about this challenge,

like, are you glad you got
the standard poodle?

352
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,633
- To be honest, I did kind of
want Miss Michaels' dog,

353
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,900
just because there's so many
beautiful shades of...

00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,600
I mean--
- That's why I got it.

356
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,433
- That dog's wearing
all my colors.

357
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:34,800
- This is gonna be so different
to see you in white, bitch.

358
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,100
- In white.

359
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,800
Well, I mean, you usually
don't see a dark lady

360
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,367
in the dog park during the day.

361
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,767
- White's not really my color.

362
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,633
Like I always say,
"Send me to hell.

363
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,900
I don't look good in white."

364
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,567
It definitely
is making me nervous.

365
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:53,266
And I'm not gonna be able to,
like, rely on my shocking makeup

366
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,734
because it's gonna have to work
with three separate looks.

367
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,066
This will be somewhat
of a challenge.

368
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,300
- Hello, hello, hello.

369
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,533
all: Hello.

370
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,066
- You look like you could use

371
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,500
a little pup talk.

372
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,600
- Ha.

373
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,834
- Ha ha.

374
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:11,934
- Hey, Latrice.

375
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,967
- Hey, Ru.

376
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,400
- Hey, Babyface.

377
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,066
Now, you've gotten heat in the
past from the judges--Santino--

378
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,367
- I have.

379
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,333
- About your styling
and your fashion sense.

380
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,367
- Yeah.

381
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,934
- Are you worried
about that at all?

382
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:27,066
- No, not really, because the
things that I have sewn myself,

383
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,800
people have raved about.

384
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,600
- Good, 'cause you are in
the final four!

385
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,834
- Oooohhh!

386
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,300
- But I gotta say...

387
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,800
there's no room for excuses
or mistakes at this point.

388
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,300
100,000 coins, darling.

389
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,400
- Yeah. And I need every bit
of all of that.

390
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,333
Because my life has been
such a roller coaster

391
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,300
and I've been so unstable
for so long, this is going to,

392
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,333
like, put me where
I'm supposed to be.

393
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,667
Being in prison,
I lost everything.

394
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,700
And it was hard.

395
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
But that 100 grand, baby...

396
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,200
that can buy some stuff.

397
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,367
- Remember, we wanna see

398
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,133
a storyline on the runway.

399
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,100
I'm gonna let you get
back to it.

400
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
Bye, Babyface.

401
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,967
[laughs]
That bitch is ignoring me.

402
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,633
- [laughs] Thank you, Ru.

403
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,834
- Well, hello, there.
- Hi.

404
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,433
- Are you making love to Filan?

405
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,467
- I've got puppy love.

406
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,800
- [laughing]

407
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,667
The judges in the past--
Michelle--

408
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,867
have said, you know,
that you're...

409
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,066
sometimes too polished.

410
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,200
What does that mean to you?

411
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,967
- I don't know what that means,
Ru, honestly.

412
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,700
I didn't come here
not to be perfect.

413
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,867
- I think she wants
more depth from you,

414
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,734
and this is the perfect
challenge for that.

415
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:35,300
What are you gonna do for your
daytime dog park realness?

416
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,500
- It's going to be
almost a little bit

417
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,100
<i>Little House On the Prairie.</i>

418
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,133
- Well, that's not particularly
a modern look.

419
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,166
- You'll--it's gonna work out
really well.

420
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,233
- We're asking you to be
fashion forward.

421
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,900
You've got a lot of work to do.

422
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,266
I'm gonna let you and Filan
get to it.

423
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,500
See you in a minute.
- Okay.

424
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,100
- Sharon Needles and Cali.
- Yeah, hi.

425
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,934
- Hi. So tell us about
your canine couture

426
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,300
inspired by Cali.

427
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,300
- I guess I'm kind of going
for a tight body suit

428
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,433
and then use the fur
as maybe like a big bolero.

429
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:11,734
- That's interesting.

430
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,967
- I think I am going to be
gold and tan tomorrow.

431
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,166
I'm running out of pale
foundation, so...

432
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,200
[both laughing]

433
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,166
- Are you transforming into
someone we don't know?

434
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,834
- Well, you know, um...

435
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,667
we'll have to see.

436
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,834
- That's interesting to hear.

437
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,533
We're down to the best
of the best.

438
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,700
You and Cali have
a lot of work cut out for you.

439
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,734
So I'll let you get
back to it, okay?

440
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,233
- No problem, thanks.

441
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,066
- Well, Phi Phi and Hunter.

442
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,567
How are you kids getting along?

443
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,300
- Well, I mean,
it was difficult at first,

444
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,100
but he's calmed down and he's
allowed me to work, so...

445
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,233
- [laughing]
Right.

446
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,433
So have you controlled
his saliva?

447
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,400
- Oh. Oh, no.

448
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,834
- Is that your inspiration?

449
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:47,867
- Absolutely.

450
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:50,700
A sticky, wet mess.

451
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,100
- Tell me about your
dog park realness.

452
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,533
- I really wanna take you,
like, to Paris...

453
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,700
- Ooh!

454
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,467
- And like poodle skirt
type of look, so...

455
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,834
[hunter whines]

456
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,900
- But the poodle skirts
are from the '50s,

457
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,600
and you've got a bloodhound.

458
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,767
- I'm gonna intertwine
both of those, like, styles

459
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,066
to make one look.

460
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,967
- Well, you know,
we really want the costumes

461
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,200
to speak for themselves.

462
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,834
We don't really want
a lot of explanation.

463
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:15,967
- Okay.

464
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,166
- Now, have you seen
<i>Paris Is Burning?</i>

465
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,066
- I've seen parts of it.
- Oh, really?

466
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,500
- Yeah.

467
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,066
- Oh, you've got you homework
to do, don't you, young lady?

468
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,934
You know what the ball scene
is all about, right?

469
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,367
- Oh, yeah.
I'm familiar with it.

470
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,633
- Have you ever walked a ball?

471
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,433
- No, but I've been asked
many times to do it.

472
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,800
- In what category?
- Face--

473
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,834
- But you didn't do it.
- I haven't done it yet, no.

474
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,300
- Ah.

475
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,967
- All right.
You get back to work.

476
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,600
- I have a lot to do.
- Bond with hunter.

477
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,166
- We have.
He's taking a nap.

478
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,633
[both laughing]

479
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:45,066
So...thank you, Ru.

480
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,734
- All right, ladies,
gather round.

481
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,200
Tomorrow on the main stage,

482
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,066
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges.

483
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:57,767
She's no bitch, but she plays
one on TV and in the movies.

484
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,300
Rose McGowan will be here.

485
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,467
- [gasps]

486
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,567
- I love Rose!

487
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,867
- Yes!
- Really.

488
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,600
- And the platinum-selling
country superstar

489
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,066
who's always best in show...

490
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,900
Wynonna Judd will be here.

491
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
- Wow!

492
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,166
- I love the Judds.

493
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,700
I love Wynonna's music.

494
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,333
She's a kickass
rock and roll chick.

495
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,633
- In addition to modeling your

496
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,066
three doggy-style outfits,

497
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,700
there's just one more
little thing.

498
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
[dog yaps]

499
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,066
[dramatic chords]

500
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:34,166
You'll need to perform a
Broadway-style opening number.

501
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,266
- Bitch, I ain't got time
to do this.

502
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,533
We're trying to pull these
three looks together.

503
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:41,734
- Think<i> Cats,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> but,</i>
you know, with dogs.

504
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:45,934
Chad, since you won the mini
challenge, you're in charge.

505
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,934
- Shit! Is Ru serious?

506
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,934
Is he trying to kill me?

507
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:52,100
- Ladies,
the dog days aren't over.

508
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,133
In fact...
they're just beginning.

509
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,934
So don't fuck it up.

510
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,300
All right, bye.

511
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,500
[dog whimpers]

512
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,567
- All right, bitches.

513
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,633
It is time to rehearse the dance
routine for the Bitch Ball.

514
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,166
Let's do some blocking.

515
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,934
Kind of my idea's for Phi Phi

516
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:12,433
to start, like, maybe...
center?

517
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,500
- And maybe we should
kind of be in hidden pose

518
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,967
until we're supposed to animate.

519
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,900
- Or maybe you're just
sitting there like...

520
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,967
- Yeah, scratching fleas
or you know how theater,

521
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,633
how things are completely still?

522
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,867
- I kind of like the idea of
everyone being animated.

523
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,367
Maybe we could do--

524
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,900
- Well, you're in charge, so
just pick, and let's get to it.

525
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,700
- I would like you to do a pose.

526
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,100
- All righty, go.
- Or sideways.

527
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,200
As we get up on our first line,
move up with Phi Phi.

528
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,133
- So maybe we just crawl up
to one point for our line,

529
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,900
and then we...

530
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,066
- Okay, this is how
it really should go,

531
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,533
like a real show.

532
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,367
Because this makes no sense.

533
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,600
So when we're singing our lines,

534
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,500
all of us should get
into our four spots,

535
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,367
and we should land here,
just like we're in a musical.

536
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,867
Or else it's gonna
look like crap.

537
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,900
I'm kinda not having it,
because I really just want

538
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,533
to get all my stuff done,
and I really just

539
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,667

a little bit intimidating

617
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:33,367

create a bolero on a leotard.

618
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:37,500
Then I realized
I've never sewn a bolero.

methamphetamines

623

Um, it's very much a poodle.

We've been working on our
outfits for a while,

627

and the only thing
that Sharon has accomplished

628
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,700
is he glued some fur on a boot.

for a minute?

to put together

and on top of that,
sewing a new outfit.

637
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:30,233
It's just the straw
on the camel's back.

638
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,200
God damn it, my fabric got
caught in my machine.

640
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,633
I think that top four
is her stop.

Sharon Needles.

00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,266
- Poomp!

647
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,667
- It's a dog-eat-dog world.

648
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,467
- Today, we're getting ready
for RuPaul's Bitch Ball.

649
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,967
We know that one of us
has got to go today,

650
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,100
so everybody's
a little bit up in arms,

651
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,633
and trying to pull it out
real quick.

652
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,300
- It's gonna be top three
after this.

653
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,500
- I know.

654
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,433
The stakes are really high
right now, you guys.

655
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:14,066
- [sighs]

656
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,367
I'm gonna lose my damn mind.

657
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,233
- Well, we don't want
to spin off the board.

658
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm feeling not so confident.

659
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm not sure, this time,
if it's gonna be enough

660
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,400
to keep me
out of the bottom two.

661
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,433
- Miss Michaels,
remember how psychic I was

662
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,266
when we first got here?
- Oh, my God!

663
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,433
- It was so creepy.

- Sharon.
- Uh-huh?

669
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
- Since you're miss clairvoyant,
who's the top three?

670
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,767
- I predict it will be Latrice,

671
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,767
and Miss Michaels...

672
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,834
and...

00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,700
Phi Phi O'Hara.

674

based on...

- Off you know, my energies...
- Oh, whatever!

676
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,467
- That I am collecting deep
into my, uh, subconscious.

677
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,567
- Are you sure that's not
because you don't feel

678
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,200
so confident?

679
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,967
- I'm probably the most worried,

680
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,734
but do I want to be in
that top three?

681
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:18,266
Absolutely.

682
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,800

doggy-inspired looks.

704
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,767
Are you ready to get this
Bitch Ball rolling?

705
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:17,934
- Ready.

706
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,266

707
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,333

- Let the Bitch Ball begin.

744
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,467
Category is...

745
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:32,400
daytime dog park realness.

746
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,533
Latrice Royale.

747
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,500
Hey, girl.

748
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,467
Give a dog a bone.
- [laughs]

749
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:38,834
- I made a little, fun skirt,

750
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,900
a little slinky top,
and some cute pumps.

751
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,934
Bitch, honey, this is what I'd
wear out to the dog park.

752
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,800
- She's a real tail wagger.

753
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,934
- [laughs]

754
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,233
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

755
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,533
- Oh, she's brought
her own pooper scooper.

756
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,200
- Oh, my gosh.

757
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,467
- I'm loving my daytime
dog park realness look.

758
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm Nicki Minaj meets Barbie.

759
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,066
- Well, poo-poo-pee-doo.

760
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,667
Phi Phi's the shit.

761
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,233
- [laughs]

762
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,633
- Up next, Sharon Needles.

763
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,767
Just another dog day afternoon.

764
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,600
- Is this another
Simpson sister?

765
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
- I'm serving true dog park

766
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,500
realness.

767
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,233
It's kind of inspired by
late '60s

768
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:19,867
Italian fashion photographs.

769
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,633
- She looks fetching.

770
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,133
That's right,
clean up after your dog.

771
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,767
Chad Michaels.

772
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,066
Uh-oh, she lost her doggie.

773
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:32,133
- I'm really loving my daytime
dog park realness.

774
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:35,867
It's light, it's flowy,
and I feel beautiful in it.

775
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,233
- I told you to keep your dog
on its leash.

776
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh, you'll find it.

777
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,133
Category is: Pooch in a purse.

778
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,100
Party girl realness.

779
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,934
Latrice Royale.

780
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,333
Hey!

781
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,533
- Well...

782
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,700
- She is on the VIP list.
- Uh-huh.

783
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,567
- My party girl look is very
chic,

784
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,266
very "Let's go cha cha,
boo boo,

785
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,333
I'll meet you at the club."

786
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,066
- She's all up in the club.

787
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,333
The kennel club.

788
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,133
- [laughs]

789
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,767
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

790
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,433
- Oh!

791
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,667
Can I borrow that wig?

792
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,066
- That's her hair, Wynonna.

793
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,400
- Oh, I am so sorry.

794
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,266
- Oh, my goodness.
Look at those heels.

795
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,400
Her dogs must be barking.

796
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,333
- My "it" girl looks like
Rihanna

797
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,367
if Rihanna had a dog.
It's edgy.

798
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,967
- She carries her poochie
in her Gucci.

799
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:24,467
- Sharon Needles.

800
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,500
Oh...

801
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,934
- Rock and roll party girl.

802
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,467
- If Courtney and Lindsay
had a baby?

803
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,533
- Yes.

804
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:30,900
- What's she got
around her ankle?

805
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,467
Uh-oh.
- Oh, it's a scram bracelet.

806
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,767
- Yes, it is.

807
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,834
- I'm serving heroin chic,

808
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,200
hung-over, party girl realness.

809
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,967
Like the celebrities I see
in my tabloids.

810
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,800
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

811
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,300
- [laughs]

812
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,600
- Eat a sandwich.

813
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,467
- [laughs]

814
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,066
Chad Michaels.

815
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,333
- Posh party girl.

816
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,433
- Ready for the paparazzi.

817
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,333
- I am serving structured

818
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,266
Kardashian realness.

819
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,200
I'm feeling very confident,

820
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm feeling a little
bitchy in it.

821
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,033
- She has a big diamond
from her rich man.

822
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,200
- Yes.

823
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,834
- And she's got a big behind
right now, too.

824
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,700
- Mm-hmm.
- Very Kardashian.

825
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,100
Category is...

826
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,333
canine couture eleganza.

827
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:17,700
Latrice Royale,
and her dog Babyface.

828
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
- It's very<i> Mahogany.</i>

829
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,333
- Yes.
Look at that furry muff.

830
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,834
- [laughs]

831
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,233
- I'm giving them sleek,

832
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:26,133
sophisticated, simple, clean

833
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,700
silhouette,
and I'm feeling good,

834
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,233
and looking gorgeous.

835
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,867
- She's dressed to the canines.

836
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:36,734
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and her dog Hunter.

837
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,233
Ladyboy and the tramp.

838
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:41,100
- Oh, look at Hunter's bow tie.

839
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,600
- I'm a hound dog.

840
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,934
- I'm just trying to serve
the judges glamorous fish,

841
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,667
and they couldn't take
their eyes off me.

842
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,667
- Oh, yeah.

843
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,033
- You know what he smells.

844
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,467
- What does he smell?

845
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,533
- Pussy willows?
- Oh, of course.

846
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,166
- [laughs]

847
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,500
- Sharon Needles,
and her dog Cali.

848
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,367
- Cali caliente.

849
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,367
- That bitch is in heat.

850
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,333
Her poodle's on fire!

851
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,400
- It looks like
I'm walking three Calis.

852
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,800
I kept all the fur on the lower
half of me,

853
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,567
and her height
matched up perfectly

854
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,700
to my canine couture boots.

855
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,233
- Do the boots match the dog,

856
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:15,667
or does the dog match the boots?

857
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,500
- [laughs]

858
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,700
Chad Michaels,

859
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,100
and her dog London Paris Filan.

860
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,467
- [laughs]

861
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,834
- Every dog has
its De La Renta.

862
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,133
- My canine couture
is just a slight nod

863
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,633
to Cruella Deville
on vacation in Aspen.

864
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,967
- It's a little<i> 101 Dalmatians.</i>

865
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,967
- Cruella.
- Yes, very Cruella.

866
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,900
- Kinkyella.
See you on the slopes.

867
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,567
- Welcome, ladies.

868
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:47,300
Let's go straight to
the judges' critiques.

869
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,567
First up, Latrice Royale.

870
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,734
- I'm loving the whole
<i>Mahogany</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>

871
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:53,133
- Thank you.

872
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,300
- I just think you've got a lot
of sass and a lot of class.

873
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
- And a lot of ass.
- Pow!

874
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,633
- [laughs]
- Eat it.

875
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,867
- Some men like a little meat
with their potatoes.

876
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,300
- [laughs]

877
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,600
- Out of all three looks,

878
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,800
I think the daytime was your
least successful.

879
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,467
Glitter navy skirt going
to the dog park--a little much.

880
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,900
- Your canine couture, simple.

881
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,133
I would've liked
a little bit more.

882
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,367
- Thank you, Latrice.

883
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,066
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

884
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,900
- Because I worked with my
prissy-butt mom for ten years,

885
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,300
I'm always looking
for the head-to-toe.

886
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,734
I think makeup-wise, flawless.

887
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,934
Your sparkles are aplenty.

888
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,367
Your boots, oh, my gosh.

889
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,834
- The dogs production,

890
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:33,867
you stole the show.

891
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,066
You were fully into, like,

892
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,266
the cute little ditzy dog role.

893
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:39,500
Your Japanime, over-the-top

894
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,066
daytime realness
was not realness.

895
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,700
- I have no interest in real.

896
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,100
- [laughing]
- I find real people boring.

897
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,300
I'd be far happier to see you
at my dog park any day

898
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,633
than to see somebody in
sweatpants and tennis shoes.

899
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,767
- She would hate us
at the dog park, Wy.

900
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:55,934
- I don't go to the dog park.

901
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,934
I have people
that do that for me.

902
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,533
[laughter]

903
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,367
- Next up, Chad Michaels.

904
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,900
- The only thing I would say
is in the opening,

905
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,467
the lip sync was a bit off.

906
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,934
- Ooh, okay.

907
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,166
- Your canine couture really
shocked me when you came out.

908
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,934
It doesn't have to be so...

909
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:12,266
old lady.

910
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:16,133
- There's something about
that look that just...

911
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:19,066
is less diva-ish.

912
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,100
- Thank you, Chad.

913
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,166
Next up, Sharon Needles.

914
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,967
- Love this look tonight.

915
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:26,166
You look like you
came out of an editorial

916
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,900
out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>

917
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,934
- [gasps] Ooh!

918
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,400
- I'm sure you
made those boots.

919
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,467
- 5-1/2 hours
and a hot glue gun.

920
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:35,700
- If somehow Liza Minnelli
in<i> Cabaret</i>

921
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,433
and Jean Harlow had a baby,

922
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,266
and threw it
in white puffy boots

923
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:42,266
with the perfect poodle,
it would be you.

924
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,300
That poodle could not have
worked the boots harder

925
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,567
with you.

926
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,200
- And it was good to see you
as a blonde-blonde,

927
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,066
not like an evil zombie blonde.

928
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,734
It was nice to see that
different side of you.

929
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,800
You continue to inspire.

930
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,100
- Ah!

931
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,667
- Thank you, Sharon.

932
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:01,133
Ladies, one final question.

933
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:05,400
Which of these bitches
does not deserve

934
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,834
to be in the top three?

935
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,867
Let's start with Sharon Needles.

936
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,734
[dramatic music]

937
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:14,767
- I'm going to say
Phi Phi O'Hara.

938
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:17,233
She has a very cutthroat
attitude.

939
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:18,967
To be America's
next drag superstar,

940
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,667
we need a sweetheart.

941
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:24,166
As drag queens, I think
we need to show as much heart

942
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,967
and family morals
amongst sisters--

943
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:27,433
- Bullshit.

944
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,700
What you said right now
is a complete lie.

945
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,300
I value family morals.

946
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,333
You're on stage lying,
is what you're doing.

947
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,800
- I'm not lying.
- But you are.

948
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,433
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
same question.

949
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:38,367
- I would definitely
have to say Sharon.

950
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:42,200
For him to stand on this stage
and tell...

951
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,834
that I don't value family
is bullshit.

952
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,133
If I'm, you know, cutthroat,
then so be it.

953
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:51,066
I'm a fierce competitor,
and I deserve to be here.

954
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,834
- Thank you, Phi Phi.

955
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:57,200
- Chad Michaels, same question.

956
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,767
- I would say Phi Phi.

957
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,867
She has...a lot maturing to do.

958
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,066
At times, she has acted her age,

959
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:08,200
and she's made no qualms about
wanting to win this contest,

960
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,300
hands down, whatever it is
that she needs to do.

961
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,767
- Latrice Royale.

962
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:16,066
- [exhales]

963
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:18,567
- I feel Sharon Needles.

964
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,834
She has gotten through this
competition being imperfect.

965
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:25,467
On the runway,
we strive for perfection.

966
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:28,767
If I was to come out here
with unfinished seams

967
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,934
and a ripped up this
and a ripped up that,

968
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:33,233
my ass would be handed to me.

969
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,767
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

970
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,233
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

971
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,066
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,

972
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:42,400
the judges and I
will deliberate.

973
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,066
[engine starts]

974
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,533
All right,
just between us girls,

975
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,066
let's start with Latrice Royale.

976
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,333
- Party girl was her best.

977
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,834
That was cute-ish.

978
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:54,300
But it wasn't enough
compared to the other divas.

979
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,800
She was just too flat
for me tonight.

980
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,066
- When she picked Sharon Needles

981
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,533
and was critiquing her
for her unfinished hemlines,

982
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:03,367
and then I looked down
and Latrice has, like,

983
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,433
something that is clearly
an unfinished hemline,

984
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:08,166
it was little like
kettle, pot, black.

985
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,100
- Right.
Phi Phi O'Hara.

986
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,734
- I was counting Phi Phi out
for a few weeks in a row,

987
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,500
and she's really
done the Phoenix

988
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,467
and risen from the ashes.
- Yeah.

989
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,066
- I was very impressed
in all facets

990
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,500
of her performance tonight.

991
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,166
- What did you think of what
Sharon had to say about her...

992
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,066
ambition in the competition.

993
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,700
- Even if someone
is extremely ambitious,

994
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,500
I don't hold that as a fault.

995
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,767
- The blessing is she's,
you know, fierce.

996
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,133
The burden is she's fierce.

997
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,100
- I totally understand
that burden.

998
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,066
- [laughs]
Me too, Rose.

999
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,133
- Little miss attitude
down there.

1000
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,166
- [laughs]

1001
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,667
Chad Michaels.

1002
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:45,367
- She's so elegant, and she
really has the "it" factor.

1003
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:49,700
- She's got the beauty and this
classy look to her

1004
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,767
that the clothes
did not live up to.

1005
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,200
- Tonight was the first night

1006
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,066
that I was like "meh" with Chad.

1007
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,333
- Sharon Needles.

1008
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,667
- She really turned it out.

1009
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:02,066
She really gave us ball
day realness, like, down.

1010
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,200
Boots!

1011
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,133
Party girl chic
was the winner for me.

1012
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,500
- She looked like an Olsen twin.

1013
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,800
- [laughs]
The canine couture,

1014
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,734
the boots that she hot-glued
together,

1015
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,433
I want to eat that shit up.

1016
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:13,533
- She owned it.

1017
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,200
It's very, very hard
for me right now

1018
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,367
to go between Phi Phi
and her for the night.

1019
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,066
- Silence.

1020
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,266
I've made my decision.

1021
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,500
Now bring back my girls.

1022
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,066
Welcome back, ladies.

1023
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:30,066
Based on your performance
in the Bitch Ball,

1024
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:32,967
I've made some decisions.

1025
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,834
[dog whining]

1026
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:38,200
Sharon Needles,
you are a lone wolf

1027
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,767
who barks to the beat
of a different drummer.

1028
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:45,066
And tonight, you are top dog.

1029
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,667
Condragulations.

1030
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,266
You are the winner
of this challenge.

1031
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,300
[applause]

1032
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,500
[dog barks]

1033
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,667
You've won crystal flower
body jewelry

1034
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,333
made by Marianna Harutunian.

1035
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,433
- Thank you so much.

1036
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,667
[dog barks]

1037
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,367
Winning this challenge
means so much to me,

1038
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,633
'cause I just never thought
I would be in the top three,

1039
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:06,367
and it's awesome.

1040
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,600
- Chad Michaels...

1041
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
- Yes, Ru.

1042
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,834
- Throughout this competition,

1043
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:12,667
you have been
a leader of the pack.

1044
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:17,166
But tonight, you didn't leave us
begging for more.

1045
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,800
[dog whimpers]

1046
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,066
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1047
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,667
- It's tough to hear
those infamous words,

1048
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,266
but I'm ready to fight for my
place in this competition.

1049
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,066
- [exhales]

1050
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:35,133
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you started
out as the runt of this litter,

1051
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,266
but tonight, you've proven that

1052
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:41,266
you can teach a young dog
new tricks.

1053
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,533
Phi Phi O'Hara...

1054
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,834
you are safe.

1055
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,200

00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,834
-Whatever you do,
I'ma wear it,

347
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,867
strut it,
and be confident in it, okay?

348
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,400
'Cause you know that's how
I roll.

349
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
[both laugh]

350
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,367
-Hello, hello, hello!

351
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,633
both: Hi!
-Hello!

352
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,900
-Hello!

353
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,433
-Hi, Kim Chi.
Hi, Briana.

354
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,467
-Hi, Ru.
-Hello.

355
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,967
-Now, Kim Chi, you're known
for really high concept,

356
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,100
Leigh Bowery style.
-Yeah.

357
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,333
-How does that translate
to a little person?

358
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,233
-Well, I ask her, like,

359
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,600
what are some of
your style inspirations?

360
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,934
And she said Jessica Rabbit
and...

361
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,133
both: Betty Boop.

362
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,967
-Cartoon makeup is
what I love doing,

363
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,066
so it's a match
made in heaven.

364
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,800
-Because of your
knowledge of design,

365
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,567
there are high expectations.

366
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,266
Does that make you nervous?

367
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,433
-It doesn't make me nervous,

368
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,166
'cause I feel like the first
challenge, I won,

369
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,600
and then I was in the bottom
right after that

370
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
and I've been safe since,

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,867
so I want to knock
this one out of the park.

372
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,834
-Good, good.
I'm looking forward to this.

373
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,333
-All right.
I'll not let you down.

374
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,567
-All right, kids.

375
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,333
Hey, guys.
-Hi, Ru. How are you?

376
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,667
-Hi, Brittney.
-Hi!

377
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,533
-Now, Brittney, have you
ever been made over before?

378
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,400
-No, I have never, but I was
on tour with Miley Cyrus--

379
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,367
-Miley Cyrus?
-Yeah!

380
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,967
She thought of the outfits,
and she made everything.

381
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:32,533
<i>So we had cones</i>
<i>coming from our boobs,</i>

382
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,166
all crazy stuff.

383
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,300
-Wow.

384
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,066
Thorgy, do you have any sketches
or anything?

385
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:39,867
-Actually, I just--that was
the stage we just got to.

386
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,200
-Okay.
All right.

387
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,934
Time is running out.
-I'm feeling the pressure.

388
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,200
-All right, Thorgy.
-Thanks a lot, Ru.

389
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,266
-Thanks, Brittney.
-Thank you.

390
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,967
-Cool.

391
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,066
-Hello!
both: Hi.

392
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,433
-So what do you have planned?

393
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,066
-Well, we are the Tin Woman,
and the Tin "Whoa, Man!"

394
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,433
-[laughs]

395
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,934
-So I was thinking
of creating

396
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:00,266
elements that can
go onto a body suit

397
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,266
or something like that.

398
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,133
-That's great, but haven't
you done that before?

399
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,200
<i>Wearing a body suit</i>
<i>or a bathing suit,</i>

400
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,433
and then putting something
on top of it?

401
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,967
We're looking for couture,

402
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,300
something inspired
by the Tin Woodsman,

403
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,233
so take it from there.

404
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,300
-I don't handle
losing very well,

405
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,667
so I will give this 120.

406
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,066
-Well, you say that while
you have a hatchet in your hand.

407
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,300
That kind of scares me.

408
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,233
[laughter]

409
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,066
All right, well, I'm gonna
let you get to it.

410
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:27,200
-[sighs]
Now I have to rethink ideas.

411
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,433
That really scares me.

412
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,400
Oh, God.

413
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,467
-All right, ladies,
gather round.

414
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,266
Gather round, ladies.

415
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:39,633
Now tomorrow, in addition
to your runway presentation,

416
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,600
I want each duo to perform

417
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,266
a dreamy interpretive dance

418
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:48,333
set in a poppy field.

419
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,700
Of course.

420
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,133
[laughs]

421
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:57,367
Ladies, good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

422
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,200
-This challenge
just went from my dream

423
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,467
to my biggest nightmare.

424
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,734
[pretends to cry]

425
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,166
-This week's maxi-challenge
is makeovers

426
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,934
<i>for the cast of</i>
<i>"Little Women: LA."</i>

427
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,300
-They're looking like they're
getting creative over there.

428
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,233
-Which one?
Oh, the Tin Man?

429
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,333
-Mm-hmm.

430
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,934
-I wouldn't be too worried
about Derrick.

431
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,467
-All right, let's do it.
-Okay.

432
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,333
-We're sleeping.

433
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,100
-Are we gonna lay down?
-Yeah.

434
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,066
-This whole time?
-Yeah.

435
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,567
It's finally time to rehearse
our interpretive dance routine.

436
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:30,100
To ask the question "Do I
understand interpretive dance?"

437
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,667
is to ask "Do I know
the entire pi formula?"

438
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:38,533
And the answer is "No."

439
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,867
-I woke up with a nightmare.

440
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,467
His face looks like
he's going for a dental checkup.

441
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,066
-Oh, my God.

442
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:48,066
Terra, you belong here with us.
-[laughs]

443
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,200
-Pow!

444
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,333
-Girl, what the hell
are you doing?

445
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,333
Like, she's just slapping
her little lady around.

446
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,300
-Fucking bitch!

447
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,667
-You gonna get a charge, girl.

448
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,600
You beating up on a little lady.

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,166
-Oh!

450
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:06,066
-I'm guessing we should
just play up the fact

451
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,967
that we're scarecrows.
-Okay.

452
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,967
-And maybe we can, like,
do like a cross, like--

453
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,633
-Should I go in front of you?
-Sure.

454
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,133
-And then it looks like
you put that leg out.

455
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,500
-I don't know what to do.
What's interpretive dance?

456
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,900
-Uh...

457
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,533
-Uh oh.
The Scarecrow people.

458
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,066
-Are they practicing?
What they doing?

459
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,533
-No, they both staring
at each other,

460
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,633
trying to figure it out.
[laughter]

461
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,367
-He ain't no choreographer.

462
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:30,600
He don't dance.

463
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,533
He was in the bottom last week.
-Uh oh.

464
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,066
-This is his time
to, like, step it up.

465
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,133
-I have no idea what the fuck
we're supposed to do.

466
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,233
-"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"

467
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,300
"What do you think?"
-"What do you think?"

468
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,967
[both laugh]

469
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,233
-Y'all better stop
thinking and start doing.

470
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,567
[laughs]

471
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:50,100
-I love you.
[both laugh]

472
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
[machine stalling]

473
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,400
Why is this machine
being a dick?

474
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,333
[machine stalling]
Oh, my God.

475
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,600
Do you want to see
something completely insane?

476
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,567
-[gasps]
What the fuck?

477
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,567
Why did you sew
it like this?

478
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,066
I don't even know
how you did this.

479
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,100
-No, I don't either.

480
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,200
Isn't that bizarre?

481
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,100
Apparently this fabric
cannot be sewn on.

482
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,166
So we've gone from a
beautiful, regal cape,

483
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:19,400
to making bustles to give us
sort of a regal flair.

484
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,533
I want to scream.

485
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,433
My brain just exploded.

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, shit!
[laughter]

488
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,300
-Yes, indeed.

489
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,633
Our little hot glue skirt
turned out good.

490
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,166
-[laughs]

491
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,900
-I'm pretty much done.
I have a complete product

492
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,400
and I'm feeling good today.

493
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,100
-This working?
-Yes, ma'am.

494
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,834
It's not gathering?
-I'm right on track.

495
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,934
-Okay.
-Yeah, it's done.

496
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,333
-What?
We're all working,

497
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,934

look that great.

there, like, "Hello?"

She's average height,

570

I was really hard on her, 'cause
I had to gain that respect.

-At an early age,

572

-I have something to ask you.

720
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,066
I know you're not
a breast drag queen.

721
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,967
Do you ever
consider contouring?

722
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:36,266
-Yes, I tried to kind of
contour tonight.

723
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:38,367
-With what,
translucent powder, girl?

724

-Yeah. I feel like
I'm in "Hunger Games."

-Totally.

733
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,266
Well, I thought
you really shone tonight,

734
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,233
and, Bob, I don't think
that's good for you.

735
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,867
Elena looks inspired
by the Good Witch,

736
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:05,066
and yours, I feel like I could
get that in a mall.

737
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,533
-I guess I thought
that was the challenge.

738
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:07,900
I was really wanting
to make sure that Elena

739
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,066
felt like a beautiful goddess,
you know what I mean?

740
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:12,300
-But you're the one competing.

741
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,200
-Okay.

-Next up, Naomi Smalls
and Jazzy Jems.

743
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:21,066
-Everyone should take a look
at Naomi right now.

744

This is how you win
this competition.

745
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,066
-Yeah, you did
an amazing job.

746
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,367
I mean, it just gave me
Scarecrow

747
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,533
in the most gorgeous way.

748
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:31,066
The look, the details,
the makeup.

749
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,834
I just thought
it was perfection.

750
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,066
-And you could not have asked
for a better partner--Jasmine,

751
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,266

752
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,400

It was just phenomenal.

753
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,200
-Thank you.

754

-Next up, Derrick

755
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,867
-It just looks so homemade,
in the worst way.

756
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,233
-Uh, I'm not a seamstress,

757
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:53,066
but I did sew everything
on here.

758
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,400
-It's a piece of fabric.

759
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,300
We're, like, pretty far in
to the competition now.

760
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
You have to give us more.

761
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,467
That is not
a Britney reference.

762
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,066
-I have watched you in Vegas.

763
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,967
I know what
you're capable of,

764
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,467
and it just sort of saddens me

765
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,433
because you're better than
what you just did up there.

766
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:12,300
-Next up, Robbie
and Hedda Turner.

767
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,567
-I literally don't even know
what to make

768
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,400
out of what you're wearing.

769
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,467
Bustles can be flattering
when they're on a big gown.

770
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,900
This looks like just a bunch
of ruched up fabric stuck--

771
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,166
And we have to work
on that hairline.

772
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,066
-I guess I'm a little
more old school.

773

-Robbie!

776
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,600
We're at this point now.
It's, like, so frustrating,

777
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,166
because you are so talented

778
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,567
and all we want is
for you to bring it.

779
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,600
And we're missing it.

780
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
-All right, Kim Chi

781

782

783
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,266

-What I was
charmed by, really,

789
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,533
was when you eased on down
the road into your dance moves.

790
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,934
-Your look tonight,
I thought it was cohesive,

791
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,867
but it didn't wow me.

792
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,166
I'm not gonna remember in a
few weeks, driving in traffic,

793
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,166
thinking "Oh, God,
remember that look?"

794
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,900
You know?

795
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,266
-Ladies,
one final question:

796
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:31,367
who deserves to click their
heels and go back to Kansas?

797
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:35,300
Starting with Chi Chi DeVayne.
-[blows out air]

798
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm sorry, Derrick, but
your outfit to me, was just...

799
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,266
a train wreck.

800
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:42,333
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Based off this challenge,

801
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,166
I would pick Derrick as well.
-Naomi.

802
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,834
-Based on execution, I would
probably say Derrick's too.

803
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,433
-Derrick.
-Well, I would say

804
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,500
all three that said me,

805
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,533
but I know I have
to pick one.

806
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,900
I would say Chi Chi's.
It's hot-glued together.

807
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
It's cut fabric
with no detail.

808
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
-What say you,
Robbie Turner?

809
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,567
-Chi Chi's didn't
scream "Dorothy" to me.

810
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,066
-Kim Chi?
-I love her,

811
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,967
but I'm going to say Chi Chi,
only because

812
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,400
yesterday, when everyone
was just working hard,

813
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,133
she was just sitting there,
and that was a time

814
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,667
that she could have
spent on her outfit.

815
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,066
Sorry.

816
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,467
-Thorgy Thor, you're up.

817
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,900
-Kim Chi, you literally said
every word that I was gonna say.

818
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,266
I think in this competition
you have to apply

819
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,333
every single second
and I'm here to win,

820
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,934
so people like
Chi Chi piss me off.

821
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,467
-Yes, I did have extra time,

822
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,367
because I did hot glue
my outfit,

823
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,867
but I did what was
in my range of doing.

824
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:33,200
But that's how they feel, so
I respect y'all's opinion.

825
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,633
-All right, I think we've
heard enough, ladies.

826
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,633
While you untuck backstage,

827
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:41,467

hot glue gunning going on,

even at the Met Ball.
-Really?

that outfit, at this point,

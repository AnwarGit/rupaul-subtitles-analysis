[laughter]

180
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,333
-I got Naomi.

181
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,834
-All right, Naomi.

182
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,734
Vogue over to the hole.

183
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:56,133
-Kack-k-k-kack
ka-kack-ka-kack, pow.

184
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,934
-Derrick Barry.

185
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:04,100
-It's gonna be even worse
than her snatch game.

186
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,367
-All right, Bob, you're up.

187
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,800
-Kim Chi!
-Yay!

188
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,967
-Look at Kim Chi go.

189
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:12,467
Oops! Oh, no!

190
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,200
Oh, shit!
[laughter]

191
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,133
-All right, ladies.

192
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,100
You have 20 minutes
to drag up your puppets.

193
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,333
Go.

194
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,367
-All right!

195
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,900
[upbeat music]

196
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
-I need the tiniest lashes
possible for Derrick.

197
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,800
-Wow.
I wear 301s, cunt.

198
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,333
-Okay, let me get the fabric
that is the cheapest,

199
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,967
without a sparkle, for Naomi.

200
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,800
-Because I don't have
to rely on fabric.

201
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,066
-You do have to rely on
your body, though, apparently.

202
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,734
-Oh, snap.

203
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:37,900
<i>Derrick and Naomi,</i>

204
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,266
I think they're getting
tired of each other.

205
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,133
-Wow.
-Remember, honey.

206
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,834
I paint for
the Las Vegas stage,

207
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,700
where you actually have
to look like someone.

208
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,900
You just have
to look like Raven.

209
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
-No, I have my own
drag aesthetic.

210
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,734
It's called Naomi Smalls.

211
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,400
-Mmm.
It's called Naomi Smalls?

212
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,900
Keep giving me material, honey.

213
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,133
-Ooh!

214
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,266
-Time's up, ladies.

215
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:04,700
Let the bitch fest begin.

216
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
Coming to the stage, Kim Chi.

217
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,734
I used to be 350 pounds.

218
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,066
And what did you
get down to?

219
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,100
349.

220
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,133
Oh, my God!

221
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,100
Condragulations, girl.

222
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,667
Well, the camera adds
ten pounds.

223
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,467
I ate, like, seven cameras.

224
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,500
Do you have a bit
of a speech impediment?

225
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,233
Speech impediment?
Oh, my God!

226
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,433
Kim, this is ridiculous.

227
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:29,066
Thank you.
Bye, Kim.

228
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,200
Oh, fuck.

229
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,667
-All right, this is Kim Chi.

230
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,233
And--oh, Chi Chi,
you're still here.

231
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,600
[laughter]

232
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,667
Ooh, um, the judges keep
telling you the word titties,

233
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,734
and all I can see
is your boy nipples.

234
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,333
Shit.
I'm a cheap queen.

235
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,133
Let's talk about
your two-inch heels.

236
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,300
[laughter]

237
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,066
They coming to the stores,
I paid 100 bucks.

238
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,834
When I saw the bag,
it said $14.99.

239
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:55,066
Why does your hair bump
never blend in to your hairline?

240
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,400
<i>-Bitch, my hair is blended in.</i>

241
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,233
Most of the time, girl.

242
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:03,133
-See, I told you,
I'm a cheap queen.

243
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,300
-So, Naomi, I'm wondering.

244
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,567
Is this your roller girl look,
neon look,

245
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,934
or Madonna kimono look?

246
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,367
They're all the same.

247
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,367
[laughter]

248
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,133
<i>[dopey music]</i>

249
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,433
-No, ma'am.

250
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,734
I have never looked like that
in my entire life.

251
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,066
I would never wear some
shake and go Beyoncé wig.

252
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,633
-There's one thing
I do want to talk--

253
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,934
Ooh, you're doing
a split, girl.

254
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,066
That's the most talented thing

255
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,567
I think I've seen you do
on this competition.

256
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,333
-Damn, Derrick,
you are cutting deep, bitch.

257
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,667
<i>This is a puppet show.</i>

258
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,133
Kids are here.
-The one thing

259
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,800
I want to talk to you about
is your snatch game.

260
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,467
Your New York was really bad.

261
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,066
-Damn, shady.

262
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,066
-Oh, Flavor Flav!

263
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,500
No, you didn't!

264
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,967
Okay, try to do that.

265
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,333
[monotone]
Oh, Flavor Flav.

266
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,066
Oh, no, you didn't.

267
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,567
-Derrick, does it hurt,
me having my hand inside you?

268
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,367
No, I'm used to sitting on
two dicks at one time.

270
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:00,834
<i>-[Bob] Derrick and Naomi,</i>
<i>they're like Tom and Jerry.</i>

271
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,633
Like NeNe Leakes
and Kim Zolciak.

272
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,066
-Derrick,
tell me about your drag.

273
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,133
Well, I don't really
have a drag style.

274
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,433
There is no Derrick Barry.

275
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,800
There is Britney Spears.

276
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,133
But I hand-sewed
this piece of fabric

277
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,433
that's just buttoned up
around my waist.

281
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,133
Hey, Bob, how you doing?

282
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm doing well.
I talk a lot.

I think I'm all that,

287
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,900
even though my wigs
look like Chi Chi's.

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,200
Yeah!

289
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,266

First category is

You know, when you were
five years old,

317
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,834
and you slipped
on those first pair of heels?

318
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:32,133
Second category is
That's My Mama Realness.

319
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:37,600
A drag look that pays tribute
to your own sweet mama.

shoes, and accessories

It's just like
giving me one note.

-Damn.

339
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,066
-I actually thought
that was very clever.

-You're not mad at it?
-No.

00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,834
-Oh, cool.
-Not at all.

tough skin, ain't you, girl?

00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,533
-And Derrick has thin hair.

-Wow.

I also have a career
with my wigs on.

350

You'll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.

-Whoa.

361
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900

what you said.

363
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,667

I do not like his drag.

369
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,333

00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:56,166
where we have to design
a high fashion costume

384
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,166

385
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,667

all: Hi!
Hello!

388
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,567
-Hi, Derrick Barry.
-Hi, Ru.

389
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,433

and mixing them
with famous paintings.

393
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,166
Because I feel like
celebrity female impersonation

394
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,433
is such an art form.
-Right.

395
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,333
But you've come
under a lot of fire

396
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,066
in terms of aesthetic.

397
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:31,266
And also last week, the judges
called you out on your makeup,

398
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,567
specifically to make
it look more draggy.

399
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,066
'Cause you paint.
You just paint what's there.

400
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,233
Do you know how to paint
an illusion on your face?

401
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,767
-Yes.

402
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,567
I will definitely be
giving you a brow.

403
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,400
-Yes, darling.
-Definitely, darling.

404
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,934
-If the judges
want me to wipe my eyebrow out

405
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,667
and draw on a new one,
I'm gonna do that.

406

<i>I'm ready to take a risk,</i>

407
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,066

408
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,300
I came here
to really challenge myself.

409
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,133
-Why, Chi Chi DeVayne.

410
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,066
-Hey, Ru the Q.

411
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:03,233
-What are you gonna do
for your Mama Drag look?

412
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,633
-My mother,
to me she's high glam.

413
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:09,166
She always wears platinum
blonde hair, long eyelashes.

414
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,734
She loves leopard.
She's a party girl.

415
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:15,867
I definitely get my ability
to dance from my mom.

416
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,266

00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,934
-Yeah.
-It's flavor.

431
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:45,867
Savor in it.

432
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,066
-Okay.
-Bask in it.

433
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,266
Never be ashamed of it.

434
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:51,567
-I'm realizing
that country is in.

-Now, last week, the judges,
Michelle, specifically,

440
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:08,100
called you out to see

441
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,066
-I'm gonna go glamorous
for my book look.

442
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:12,233
So I'm taking this corset.

443
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,633
I've already got
three pieces glued down.

444
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,166
Look at me go.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

445
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,166
-Do a corset
that kind of branches out,

446
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,133
goes past the bosoms.
-Yes.

447
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,100
-Then I'm gonna do
like a gradient color.

448
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
-Well, 'cause you know,
Michelle

449
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,233
calls your drag ratchet drag.

450
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,367
-Yeah.

451
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,100
-I am in love with
the way you look tonight.

452
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,834
Less ratchet, more fashion.

453
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,767
-Do you call your drag
ratchet drag?

454
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,900
-I've never called it ratchet,
but that term doesn't offend me.

455
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,367
-Is that a conscious decision?

456
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,600
-It's a conscious decision.

457
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,700
'Cause if you come
to one of my shows,

458
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,400
it's like me
on stage by myself

459

my eyebrows become my moustache,

See what I mean?

464
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:50,834

in a leotard.

and really rare form

that cute, actually.

529
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,867
-Well, I'm actually
kind of thankful

530
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,100
that I was in the bottom two,

531
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,133
because it literally lit a fire
underneath my ass.

532
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,166
This is what I want to do,
and I should just

533
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,133
fuckin' bring it
every single time.

534
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,533
-Well, you know, two weeks ago,
it was a design challenge

535
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:25,900
that you won.
-Mm-hmm.

536
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
-And I want
that same excitement

537
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,066
from you in this challenge.

538
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,400
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm just
nervous, because the judges

539
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,767
like what I'm doing so far,

540
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:37,066
and I don't want to give them
any reason to doubt me.

541
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,433
I want to prove to them
that I'm not a one-hit wonder.

542
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,166
-Well, I can't wait to see
what you're going to do.

543
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,300
-Thank you, Ru.
-Get back to work.

544
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,066
-Hi, Kim Chi.
-Hi, Ru.

545
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,934
-You're a design queen.
-Yes, I am.

546
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,767
-So this is something
you can sink your teeth into.

547
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:51,867
What are you planning?

548
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:52,934
-With all three of the runways,

549
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,066
it's kind of like
a visual fairy tale.

550
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,700
So I'm going to start off
as a little sprout.

551
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
-Uh-huh.
-And through drag,

552
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,367
I blossom into the artist

553
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,734
that I'm going to become.
-Wow.

554
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:05,333
So, now, this challenge
has a part

555
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,734
that pays homage
to your mother.

556
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,567
What is that gonna look like?
-Oh, my gosh.

557
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,066
So this one I'm really
excited about.

558
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,900
I brought a traditional
Korean hanbok,

559
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,767
<i>because my mother</i>
<i>taught me to be proud</i>

560
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,133
of who I am and my heritage.

561
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,800
-It's something
your mother has worn before?

562
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,834
-Yes.
-Has she seen you in drag?

563
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,967
-She doesn't know
that I do drag.

564
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,066
-What?
-I know.

565
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,066
My mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.

566
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,700
-You know she's gonna
see this show.

567
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,100
Are you afraid?
-I am a bit afraid

568
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,266
that she might see
all of this as,

569
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,700
like, a waste of time.

570
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
I just want my mom
to be able to be proud of,

571
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,066
like, everything that I do.

572
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,700
You know, the person
that I am today.

573
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,133
-You think she doesn't
know that already?

574
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,333
-I don't think so, no.

575
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,533
-Hmm.

576
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,567
<i>[plaintive music]</i>

577
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,834
-Have you never
shown her that side of you?

578
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,333
-Not really,
'cause I just

579
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,600
don't like being
vulnerable with my mom.

580
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,767
-Right.
-'Cause then she might think

581
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,734
that I'm a weak person,

582
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:03,066
and I want to portray myself
as anything but that.

583

<i>-[Bob] I think that Kim</i>
<i>should tell her mom.</i>

584
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,066
'Cause I feel like
if you're not really

585
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,834
opening yourself up
to your family,

586
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,300

588
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,834

for who you are.

589

I mean, in theory, I know Kim

590
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,233
better than her fuckin' mom
knows her.

591
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,934
That's not fair.

592
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,266
-Is that why you got
so emotional on the runway

593
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,967
when you were being critiqued?

594
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:26,133
-I felt like I tried my best,
but it just didn't work out.

595
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,266
So I just got really frustrated.

596
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,133
-I just felt
like there was a sense of shame

597
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,200
when you broke down.

598
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,033
Somehow they're
all linked together.

599
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,233
I'm not sure how.

600
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,633
And that's what I'm
trying to get at.

<i>-[Kim] I'm very hard on myself</i>

Especially growing up,

603
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,700
because I wasn't
the model child,

604
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,734
and I was the "artistic" one.

605
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:47,033
<i>And last week's performance</i>
<i>was a letdown,</i>

606
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,567
because I feel like
my mom probably

607
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,900
wouldn't be proud
of what I did.

608
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,033
-I just want to do really well
in this competition.

609
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,233
-You have done really well.
It's top five.

610
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,133
You are so talented.

611
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,734
Everybody knows that about you.

612

613
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,467
-I know it, yeah.
-But do you own it?

614

-No, right now. I will own it.
-Okay.

617
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,800
I need you to really
hear yourself say that,

618
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,200

to this competition.

620

an opening number.

00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,934
-You're walking like a model.

702
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:28,533
And I need you to walk
like Jerri Blank.

703
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,867
Yeah, think a hunchback.
-There you go.

704
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,166
-Yeah.
-She has a FUPA.

705
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,834
-Think scoliosis,
like you had in high school.

706
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,734
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I actually have</i>
<i>no idea</i>

707
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,500
who the fuck is Jerri Blank.

708
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,200
What's "Strangers With Candy"?

709
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,734
Somebody please tell me.

710
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:41,834
[laughter]

711
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,266
-Think, like, first
of all, do this face,

712
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,533
and then come down and--

713
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:48,800
[vocalizing]

714
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,967
-Derrick is doing this,
like, weird thing.

715
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,967
She's playing like a fuckin'

716
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:56,367
caveman almost.

717
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,066
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the fuck she's doing.</i>

718
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,834
-This is the sexiest
you've ever looked.

719
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,800
<i>-We down to the top five.</i>

720
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,066
I ain't gonna correct her.

721
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,667
-[sighs]
-Whoo.

722
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,700
-So we're back
in the work room,

723
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,100
<i>and it's crunch time.</i>

724
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,467
-Make it or break it right now.

725
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,066
-We have a short
amount of time,

726
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:17,100
so it's work, work, work.

727
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,934
[sewing machine whirring]

728
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,500
<i>-I'm nervous</i>
<i>about this challenge.</i>

729
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,767
I'm trying to prove
that I can be glamorous.

730
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:25,066
<i>But this is not</i>
<i>my field of expertise.</i>

731
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,667
I don't work with unconventional
materials at home.

732
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,734
This is very stressful.

733
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,133
It's a lot of shit.
-Yeah.

734
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:30,734
-Yeah, there's
just so much to do.

735
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,800
This is, like, crazy.

736
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,533
-For my book drag,
I decided to use cardboard.

737
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,767
Because I want, like,
a really structured dress.

738
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm taking
some very bold moves.

739
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm not sewing anything.

740
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,767
-Thank God.

741
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,767
-All hot glue and spray paint.

742
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,433
-I mean, well, bitch,
somebody got to go home.

743
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,533
-[chuckling]
Oh, yeah.

744
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,100
-Bob's using more cardboard

745
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,066
than she is books.

746
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,567
<i>That's not the challenge.</i>

747
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,367
<i>Honey, you got it all wrong.</i>

748
00:25:55,367 --> 00:26:00,066
You're in for a rude
awakening, girl.

749
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,967
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] For today's</i>
<i>maxi challenge,</i>

750
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,667
we're getting ready
for the Book Ball.

751
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,633
This challenge is
literally super-important,

752
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,867
because it decides
who makes the top four.

753
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,433
It's a huge deal.

754
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:12,967
-So, do you guys feel,
like, a lot of pressure

755
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,600
about being top five
and having to perform well?

756
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,367
-I think it would suck
especially to go home right now.

757
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,867
'Cause it's literally
so close you can taste it.

758
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,066
-Do you think you
hands-down deserve to win?

759
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,133
-Yeah.

760
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:25,100
I think everyone
should have that mentality.

761
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,834
-Agreed.
-Most definitely.

762
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,633
-Why do you think
you deserve to win?

763
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,433
-I've got the best grades
in school.

764
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,867
-But when you look at
RuPaul's beauty and grace,

765
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,500
do you feel
like you possess that,

766
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,433
because I don't see,
in the past winners,

767
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:39,633
the beauty that they have.

768
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,767
-Damn.

769
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,266
-That bitch
just called you ugly.

770
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,900
-No, no, no.
[laughter]

771
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,166
I've just never heard them
ever say to a previous winner

772
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,100
that they did ratchet drag.

773
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,600
-All the queens
think that I can't be glamorous

774
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,066
because Michelle called me
ratchet one time, in a good way.

775
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,800
And it's all they can cling to,
especially Derrick.

776
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
You keep thinking ratchet drag
means something bad.

777
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,233
Ratchet and like, this idea
of somebody being raggedy

778
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,066
are not the same thing.

779
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,934
-But Bob, I've seen,
like, your videos online,

780
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:08,200
and I think you're very funny,

781
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,967
but, like, the first thing
I thought was, like,

782
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,800
she literally wears lips
and lashes.

783
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,066
-Whoo.

784
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,066
-I guess,
but I mean, I do my thing.

785
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,667
You know, people
will come to my show.

786
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,400
-I just think, like,
makeup is very important

787
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
because the moment people
look at you,

788
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
that's the first thing you see.
-Yeah.

789
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,433
-I also want to say,

790
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,567
my makeup's
not that fuckin' bad.

791
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,066
-Ooh.

792
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:28,166
-You guys act like I have,
like, the worst makeup

793
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,133
in "Drag Race" history.

794
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,567
Granted, it's not the best.

795
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,467
I am no makeup artist.

796
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,667
-I don't think
your makeup is terrible,

797
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:38,066
it just looks like
you're not wearing any.

798
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,266
-It's a bit of a shock,

799
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,667
people thinking
that my makeup is so bad,

800
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,967
'cause no one's ever
read me for my makeup.

801
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,934
-I don't think you even
try to, like,

802
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,734
add more dimensions
with your makeup.

803
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,100
-I do feel, though,
the judges say,

804
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,967
"Oh, I can see you're trying."

805
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,834
-I think the judges
are comparing Bob to himself.

806
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:55,934
<i>But if you compare Bob</i>
<i>to me and Naomi,</i>

807
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,133
Bob's makeup is nonexistent.

808
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,100
I'm not, you know, like,
putting your talents down.

809
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,066
But I just think, like,
if all people have to see

810
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,967
is, like, your pictures,
to, like, judge you--

811
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,834
-Because there is, like,
a standard with drag.

812
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,066
Especially "Drag Race."

813
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,867
You have to have your makeup
at a certain level.

814
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,133
You have to have your wigs
at a certain level.

815
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:13,233
<i>-They're absolutely right.</i>

816
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,834
I pay more attention
to my performances

817
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,066
than I do to my makeup.

818
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:19,133
But what matters is,
are you delivering a product

819
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,800
to people who want to buy it.

820
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,066
That's what matters.

821
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:25,200
So if your thing is beauty,

822
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,433
then yeah, beauty matters a lot.

823
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,333
But my goal is to be
an entertainer.

824
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,867
And I am an entertainer.

825
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:32,934
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm not saying
that you should just be
beautiful,

826
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,667
and you should win
because it's a beauty pageant.

827
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,967
But you don't have to be
a fuckin' stand-up comedian,

828
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,467
or just a live singer
or a dancer.

829
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,567
-Why you coming--
why you coming for me, bitch?

830
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,867
-There is definitely
a beauty standard

831
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:45,967
when it comes to drag.

832
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,633
You could be doing
an amazing death drop,

833
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,467
but it's not gonna be
as impressive

834
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,767
if you look a fuckin'
busted mess.

835
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,834
-My name's Bennett,
and I'm not in it,

836
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,233
but I will say is I do think...

837
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,233
-You in it now, bitch.

838
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,433
-I think you need a talent

839
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,066
to not only win

840
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,567
but to make money in the future.

841
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:03,767
Like, I'm a dancer.

842
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,433
Everybody knows that I dance.

843
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,900
Everybody knows Bob does--

844
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,233
-Everything.

845
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:11,100
[laughter]
-Everybody knows.

846
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,367
-Whoo!

847
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,700
-Not makeup.

848
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,533
-I think you need
some kind of talent.

849
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:19,200
I mean, Naomi,
I look at you as a model.

850
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,367
-Oh!

851
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,066
-And to me,
that's the only that I've--

852
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,567
you know what I mean,
that I've seen.

853
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,233
That's what I get from you.
-Right, I agree.

854
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,934
I think you're
gonna take great photos,

855
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,500
but that does not take talent.

856
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,066
-Being a drag queen
is such a talent.

857
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,800
You are a performer.
You have to be a makeup artist,

858
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,400
you have to be a hairstylist,
you have to be--

859
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,633
-So if you're a hairstylist,

860
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:38,467
why haven't you glued down
your lace fronts?

861
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,867
-Oh, shit.
The library has opened again.

862
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,400
<i>Insert shady rattlesnake</i>
<i>noise here.</i>

863
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Roo koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-
koo-koo-koo-koo.

864
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,567
-Bitch, glue down your brows,
and then I'll glue down my lace.

865
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,700
-I cannot wait
to see a shot of you

866
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,500
and have screen caps go around,
and it's just lifted lace.

867
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,133
-And you know
what yours is gonna be?

868
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,667
It's gonna be so much light
reflected off that forehead,

869
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,667
because there's
no brow on there.

870
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,433
-[laughs]

871
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,433
I love that you two
can't let it go.

872
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:04,934
Derrick, you and I are not
frenemies any more.

873
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:07,333
You two are almost enemies
at this point, girl.

874
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,734
-And I didn't get the challenge
to do my brows

875
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:11,367
until my last challenge.

876
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:12,800
-But the judges
told you to do that.

877
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,300
The judges haven't told me
to glue down my wigs yet.

878
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,500
They're telling you
to change up your makeup

879
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,467
and carve out your face.

880
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,700
<i>-Do you not understand</i>
<i>what I do for a living?</i>

881
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
I don't carve my face out.

882
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,734
There's no lines on my face.

883
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:28,367
<i>That's not gonna look</i>
<i>like a female illusion.</i>

884
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,166
That's going to look
like drag makeup.

885
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,433
Not one time
did they tell me

886
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,133
that my makeup is not good.

887
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,934
-And I'm telling you,
like, as a friend,

888
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:36,967
change up your makeup.

889
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,367
It's not me digging at you.

890
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,033
-There are some digs in there.

891
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,700
[laughs]

892
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,266
-But, Naomi,
why would I change my makeup

893
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,767
when I impersonate
Britney Spears for a living?

894
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,967
-And that's why it bugs me.

895
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,533
Because we're coming
into this competition,

896
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,433
and we're representing
ourselves.

897
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,333
We're not representing
a celebrity.

898
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,834
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I feel like</i>
<i>I'm telling Derrick</i>

899
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,467
what the judges
have been tiptoeing

900
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,667
around this entire time.

901
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,300
And literally someone just needs
to be blunt about it,

902
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,600
<i>because Derrick</i>
<i>is not understanding it.</i>

903
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,967
And even though Derrick
never really asked me,

904
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:09,800
but someone needs
to tell him the truth.

905
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,066
Who is Derrick Barry?

906
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,333
Chad came here
with his own aesthetic.

907
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,900
He wasn't doing Cher
the entire time.

908
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,567
-Chad had been doing drag
for years, and--

909
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,967
-And so have you.
-And not impersonating Cher.

910
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,133
-Okay.

911
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,400
Like, when you're coming
to represent you

912
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,533
as a drag queen,
not Britney Spears,

913
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,934
why wouldn't you come
as Derrick Barry?

914
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:29,367
-Being compared to
Britney Spears in the slightest

915
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,433
is the biggest compliment
in the world.

916
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,367
And if I have to change
my face to be myself,

917
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:38,367
then I'm not really
being myself.

918
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:42,066
I just think that you've been
upset with me doing well

919
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,767
in times where you didn't,

920
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,533
so you take digs at me
to make yourself feel better.

921
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,567
-I disagree with Derrick
saying that Naomi goes after him

922
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,066
because she's insecure.

923
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,300
Naomi sees Derrick's skill level

924
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
as not being up to par
with everybody else,

925
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,734
and that's why she's frustrated
that Derrick Barry's still here.

926
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,266
-Am I the first person
who's ever

927
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,400
said anything like this,
ever, to you?

928
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,066
-That has said
my makeup is not good?

929
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:03,533
-I didn't say
your makeup's not good.

930
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,266
It's just not drag.

931
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,834
-These are the most octaves
I've ever heard Naomi speak in,

932
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,066
that's for sure.

933
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,300
You get her excited, girl,

934
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,800
she becomes
Mariah Carey, honey.

935
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,266
-[laughs]

936
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,667
-I just have never said
that you don't belong here,

937
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,133
so for you to say
that I don't belong here--

938
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,600
-I never said
you don't belong here,

939
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,734
it's just that we literally--
-You did.

940
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,133
You said it bugs you
that I'm here.

941
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,633
-No, the thing
that bugs me is

942
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,900
that you are here
finding who you are,

943
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
this entire journey.

944
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,066
And we all came here
with our own fuckin' aesthetic.

945
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,333
-Whoo!

946
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,867
-I'm here
in this room with you

947
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,433
right now in the top five.

948
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:34,533
-Okay.

949
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,066
I'm so annoyed.
[laughs]

950
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,066
[dramatic music]

951
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,800
-When's dinner?

952
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,133
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

953
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,467
[laughter]

954
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:45,133
-Wow.

955
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,266
-Oh.

956
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:50,867
-We are getting ready
for the Book Ball.

957
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:53,133
<i>And we are all feeling</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>

958
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,166
This is the challenge
that is going to determine

959
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,066
who's gonna be
in the top four.

960
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:00,200
The heat is on.

961
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,233
-Is there anything
about the runway

962
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,433
that you're worried about?

963
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:04,500
-There's a chance
I might not use the bottom

964
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,800
of my outfit.

965
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,166
You know when you
spray paint something

966
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,533
but it's laying down,
then you lift it up

967
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,266
and things are showing that
weren't showing before?

968
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,233
-Yeah.

969
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,200
-But they want me
to be glamorous,

970
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,233
so I want to wear a gown.

971
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:14,400
-Short can be glamorous.

972
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,166
Glamorous just
doesn't mean like a mermaid,

973
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,266
like, long silhouette.

974
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:20,533
-Yeah, but she's like,
full-on glamour.

975
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,567
So I made this mermaid gown.

976
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,533
But it's hard to walk in,

977
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,100
<i>and I think I can be glamorous</i>

978
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,367
<i>without wearing a dress</i>
<i>the size of Kentucky.</i>

979
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:32,400
This is a risk
I'm willing to take.

980
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,467
-Derrick?
-Hi.

981
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,400
-My mirror's right here.

982
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
-I don't feel good about what
happened with Derrick yesterday.

983
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,100
I feel like my mom would've,

984
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,867
like, really, like,
slapped my hand about that.

985
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:45,333
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to bury the hatchet.

986
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,800
So if he needs a zip-up,
if he needs advice,

987
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
if he needs anything,

988
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,066
I will definitely be the one
to give it to him.

989
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,467
-I'm going to powder
and then glue again.

990
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,567
Is that what you do?

991
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,900
-Well, I don't cover my--

992
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,066
-Oh, you don't glue down,
that's right.

993
00:33:57,066 --> 00:34:00,133
-But when it comes down to time
to shape, let me know.

994
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,066
-Yeah.

995
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,533
<i>The judges have asked me,</i>

996
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,633
so for the first time
in this competition,

997
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,700
I am blocking out my brows.

998
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,066
Ooh.

999
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:11,133
<i>I am going for</i>
<i>three different brow looks.</i>

1000
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,333
I just want to show
that I'm comfortable

1001
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,867
being a different character
out there.

1002
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:18,600
I want my brow like here,
and then out.

1003
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,066
Does that sound right?

1004
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:23,400
-You can start....

1005
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,300

<i>-I'm proud</i>
<i>that he's trying</i>

1011
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,867
to give the judges
something new,

1012
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:42,066
<i>but he only wants to ask me</i>
<i>about his eyebrows,</i>

1013
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,734
<i>and changing up your face</i>

1014
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,600
is so much more
than just eyebrows.

1015
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,066
But I'm giving Derrick space,

1016
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,367
because I don't
want him to think

1017
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:50,834
that I'm coming for him
about his makeup.

1018
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,066
-What are you doing
for your mom look?

1019
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,266
-She wore this blue dress
in our family photo,

1020
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:56,834
and I did a take on that,

1021
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:59,066
but it's more sheer.

1022
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,233
-Uh-huh.
What's your relationship like?

1023
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,934
-My mom was
great growing up.

1024
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,133
She was my best friend.

1025
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:07,066
When I came out to her
when I was 19,

1026
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,867
that's when everything changed.

1027
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,700
<i>When I came out to my mom,</i>

1028
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,934
I thought she would embrace me
with open arms.

1029
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:17,633
And I got the complete
opposite reaction.

1030
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:19,133
The only thing she said was,

1031
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,100
"Do you mind
if I keep this under my hat?"

1032
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,433
-When she said that,
did you take, like,

1033
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,600
super offense?

1034
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,433
-I, like, shut down.

1035
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,533
I wish I had not told her.

1036
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,166
Her opinion changed of me,

1037
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:31,667
and my opinion had changed
of her at that point, you know?

1038
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,200
-Damn.

1039
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,533
<i>-That's why I have a lot</i>
<i>of empathy for Kim Chi.</i>

1040
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,900
Because I know that when a kid

1041
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,934
feels broken down
by their parents,

1042
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:46,266
it's something that will always

My mom has always
been a believer in my talent,

and taught me to shoot
for the stars.

1050

00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:15,066
-Yeah.

1378
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:16,433
-Thank you, Bob.
-Thank you.

1379
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:18,066
-All right, up next.

1380
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:19,300
Derrick Barry.

1381
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,133
-I have seen what you've done
with your eyebrows.

1382
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:24,100
I acknowledge that you're
trying something different.

1383
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,166
But it's going to be
a journey for you.

1384
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,400
This, tonight, for me,

1385
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,867
I just thought
it was way too plain,

1386
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,767
and way too basic.

1387
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,400
-But I like that it looks
like you have a real vagina.

1388
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,834
-She does.
-Yeah.

1389
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,233
-Yeah.
-My mom would be so proud.

1390
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,500
-Oh, yeah?

1391
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,633
-Derrick, I see you trying
harder than anyone else,

1392
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:44,967
and that I applaud.

1393
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,667
But I think
you're getting lost

1394
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,166
in what we want.
-Okay.

1395
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:51,367
-We want you to do you
at this level.

1396
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:55,700
And I don't know
that you're at this level.

1397
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,333
-[RuPaul] All right, Chi Chi
DeVayne.

1398
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:01,100
-Your dress tonight is really
one of my favorites.

1399
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,967
-Thank you, Jesus.

1400
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,066
-Each one of these looks
told a story

1401
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:07,600
that made me get
to know you a little bit better,

1402
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,967
especially with your mom.

1403
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:10,166
Your mom is giving me

1404
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,700
"Real Housewife" of
I hope my neighborhood.

1405
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,500
[laughter]

1406
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,066
-Real Housewives of Shreveport.

1407
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:16,834
-Yeah.

1408
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:18,200
-Everything that you read,

1409
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,800
your voice
just really super sized it.

1410
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,967
And I think you have
my favorite line

1411
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,200
of the evening,
was that

1412
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,433
"I'm just a country girl
with dreams."

1413
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:26,700
[laughter]

1414
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,100
You just seemed
really natural and honest,

1415
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,600
and I think you did
a great job with that.

1416
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,767
-Ooh, thank you.

1417
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:32,767
-I completely disagree.

1418
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:35,500
[laughter]

1419
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,834
-Thank you, Chi Chi,
and thank you, ladies.

1420
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:40,100
Now, while you go and curl up

1421
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,233
with a good book backstage,

1422
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:45,533
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1423
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:46,633
All right, now,

1424
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:49,266
just between us
best-selling authors,

1425
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:50,567
what do you think?

1426
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,533
Kim Chi.

1427
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:54,767
-Kim Chi is a walking
art exhibit.

1428
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,300
And tonight there was
so much emotion

1429
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,133
with the stories of her mom.

1430
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:02,433
-Who doesn't, by the way,
know that she does drag.

1431
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:05,567
-There was absolutely no joy
when she was her mother.

1432
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,633
She conveys a lot to me
by not saying anything.

1433
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,900
-Yeah, there's a lot
to read between the lines there.

1434
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,066
When she did her voice-over,

1435
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:13,767
the conviction
wasn't quite there.

1436
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,233
There's still a tentative thing.

1437
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:19,200
And I think once her mother
gets to meet her,

1438
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,834
and they get over
that part of it,

1439
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,166
Kim Chi will fully blossom.

1440
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,800
Naomi Smalls.

1441
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,100
-Miss Underdog 2016.
-Yes.

1442
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,300
-I mean, who saw this coming?

1443
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,800
I am filled with joy for her.

1444
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,333
She's just come full circle,

1445
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,467
and at 21 years old,
listening to direction.

1446
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,166
-Yes.
-And pushing herself.

1447
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,300
-Naomi is checking every box
for me.

1448
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,834
She is checking fashion
She is checking glamour.

1449
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,233
She is checking performance.

1450
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:45,166
She is checking heartstrings.

1451
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,000
Now I find myself
rooting for her.

1452
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,500
But is it too late?

1453
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,734
-I don't think it's too late.

1454
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,867
At least she got there.
-Better late than never.

1455
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,767
-It's like a period.
-What's that?

1456
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:57,767
-Something I had
a long time ago.

1457
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:59,433
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.

1458
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:02,266
-Bob, I thought,
nailed Jerri Blank.

1459
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,734
Out of everybody,
she had the character the best.

1460
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:07,800
What I don't like is the fact

1461
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,400
that she wore a cardboard dress,

1462
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,700
and books are not made
of corrugated cardboard.

1463
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,200
-Don't judge a book
by its cover.

1464
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,533
[laughter]

1465
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,066
You know, I didn't mind
the dress or the cardboard.

1466
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:19,100
At least he added
some color to it.

1467
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,433
And he made me laugh,
just looking at him.

1468
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,300
-You can just tell
that he's funny.

1469
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,667
The humor kind
of just rolls off of him.

1470
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,633
-Derrick Barry.

1471
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:30,500
-I will commend Derrick
on going all the way.

1472
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,767
To a different species,
which was--

1473
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,233
-Feces?
What'd you say?

1474
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:34,300
[laughter]

1475
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,767
You hear what
you want to hear.

1476
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:36,800
-Exactly.

1477
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,834
[laughter]
-Uh-huh.

1478
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:40,633
-However, it was just bad,

1479
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,533
bad night in general
for Derrick.

1480
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,667
She had, like,
two lines for blush,

1481
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,633
instead of being contoured
and buffed out.

1482
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,200
This is a drag competition.

1483
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,934
Come dimensional.

1484
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:52,367
When she reimagined her mother
on a sexy night in a nightgown,

1485
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:53,700
that convoluted story

1486
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,066
I can't even put my head around.

1487
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:58,166
This is all a
fuckin' reach, okay?

1488
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,100
The thing, you're on stage,
she glued your book to a corset

1489
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,100
and put panties on
and she was done.

1490
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,233
This was a miss tonight.
I'm sorry.

1491
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:09,667
-Yes, Derrick's wasn't up
to par with the other girls,

1492
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,767
but is anyone trying
harder than Derrick?

1493
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:13,200
And that's got
to count for something.

1494
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,834
-She's so willing
to receive the critique.

1495
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,800
-But this is not the place
to find out who you are.

1496
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,367
She's at her limit.

1497
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,233
-Chi Chi DeVayne.

1498
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:23,600
-Where Derrick
is getting our critiques

1499
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,667
and getting lost in it,

1500
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:26,133
Chi Chi is getting our critiques

1501
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,834
and figuring it out.
And it's working.

1502
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:33,266
This is when the horses
are rounding that--

1503
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,166
I've never seen a horse race,
but when they go in there right

1504
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,667
before they finish, and, like,
one of them sort of,

1505
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,100
like, they start to separate?

1506
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,867
-Yes, yes.
-This is that moment.

1507
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:40,734
-Seabiscuit.

1508
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:42,333
-Yes. She's--
-Yes.

1509
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,233
-And I'm hung up on that horse.

1510
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:45,467
-I thought her writing
was really good,

1511
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,500
and I could listen
to hear talk forever.

1512
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,767
She's just got such star power.

1513
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:53,100
There's a genuineness

1514
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,633
that flows off of her.
-Yes.

1515
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:58,934
-For me, I'm gonna say
probably my favorite.

1516
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:00,200
-Wow.

1517
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,834
-Because neck and neck
with Kim Chi,

1518
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:04,066
and what broke it was
the performance of Jerri,

1519
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:05,066
took it over the top for me.

1520
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:07,500
-But Kim Chi's mama drag,

1521
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,100
it was so completely
compelling, so mournful

1522
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,400
and so closeted, culturally.

1523
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,367
And that, to me,
is real acting.

1524
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,700
I just--completely
captivated by her.

1525
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,800
-All right.

1526
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,934
Silence!

1527
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,066
I've made my decision.

1528
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,934
Bring back my...

1529
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:27,066
[inhales deeply]

1530
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:29,166
Girls.

1531
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:34,667
Chi Chi DeVayne, this week
you shredded the runway.

1532
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,066
You're safe.

1533
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,467
Kim Chi.

1534
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,867
Your botanical garden trilogy

1535
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:50,166
is destined to be a best seller.

1536
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,900
Condragulations,
you are the winner

1537
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,400
of this week's challenge.

1538
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,667
[applause]

1539
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,567
-Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1540
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:02,300
-You've won a $2,500 gift card
from Fabric Planet.

1541
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,700
-Kamsahamnida.

1542
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,500
<i>-[Kim Chi] I'm floating in air</i>
<i>right now.</i>

1543
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,066
I'm in a cloud with unicorns,
riding through the rainbow.

1544
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:11,967
I could just jump up and down,
'cause I'm so happy.

1545
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,600
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.

1546
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,367
You're safe.

1547
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,333
You may join the other girls.

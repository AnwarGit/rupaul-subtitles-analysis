00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,066
"that you need to fucking
embrace it,

717
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,066
"because that‘s what
makes you special.

718
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,233
"Be proud that you‘re not like
all the other boys,

719
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:26,934
"and just do what you do best,

720
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:28,367
"and that‘s just being you,

721
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,967
‘cause that‘s what people
are gonna love you for."

722
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,567
Thank you, Naomi.

723
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,200
Condragulations, ladies.

724
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,100
Each of you made it
to the top four

725
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
the old-fashioned way.

726
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,066
You mother-tucking earned it,

727
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:45,166
but in very different ways.

728
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,200
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.

729
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,066
First up, Bob The Drag Queen.

730
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,600
-You can really dance.
-Thank you.

731
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
You come to life
when you use dance moves.

732
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,900
And you had
such great elegance

733
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,066
<i>and length to your body.</i>

734
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,100
<i>You made it look fabulous,</i>

735
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,300
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"Wow, Bob The Drag Queen</i>

736
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,133
is giving us some glamour."

737
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,233
Tonight, on the runway,

738
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,967
because we‘ve seen leggings
a lot from you,

739
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,300
I wish it would have just
gone that extra notch

740
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,166
to do a gown.

741
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,600
I was sort of torn
on the leggings,

742
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
which, by the way, is what
I would do to those leggings

743
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,066
-if I tried to put ‘em on.
-[laughs]

744
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:19,066
But I think this is a really
good place for your drag.

745
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:20,066
Let‘s talk about your journey.

746
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,400
You‘ve managed to do
a really good job

747
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,633
of standing out.

748
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:25,233
You have managed to be hilarious
throughout,

749
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:28,600
and you‘ve also listened
to the judges and grown.

750
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,066
I see an evolution with you.

751
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:30,667
Thank you, Bob.

752
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,667
Thank you.

753
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,166
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

754
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,934
Ooh, girl, you‘ve
come a long way

755
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,533
from Shreveport, Louisiana.

756
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,533
I heard that.

757
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,467
[all laughing]

758
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,500
Tonight, is it
the most creative thing

759
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,066
we‘ve ever seen
on the main stage?

760
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,066
No.

761
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,900
But you look stunning,

762
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
and I love the pageant hair.

763
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,066
It‘s one of my favorite things
in the world,

764
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,066
is that pageant hair
with the 18 buns on top.

765
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:52,400
The music video,
very nice job.

766
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,600
<i>That was, like, your moment</i>
<i>where you were living,</i>

767
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,166
‘cause you were, like,
in the mirror,

768
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,533
and you were all done up,
and it was just you being you.

769
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,066
The wind scene, you looked
gorgeous in that.

770
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,433
<i>Because you dance,</i>

771
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,633
you had the fluidity,
and you knew just what to do

772
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,233
on that black box.

773
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,600
[all laughing]

774
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I have to talk
about some of your journey.

775
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,967
Your taste level was, um,
questionable.

776
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,133
Am I surprised
that you‘re here?

777
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,066
Yes, if I had a time machine
and came here now,

778
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:20,133
I would be shocked,

779
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,133
but you put in the work,

780
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,200
and I love a surprise ending.

781
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,066
You‘re like the M. Night
Shyama-lama-lan

782
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,100
of drag queens, right?

783
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,266
I didn‘t see this coming.

784
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,100
Our little girl has grown up.

785
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,934
Chi Chi, if I had moisture
left in my body,

786
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:35,066
I‘d probably
shed a tear tonight.

787
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,467
[all laughing]

788
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,667
But I dried up years ago.

789
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,066
Yes, everybody knows it.

790
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:41,533
Thank you, Chi Chi.

791
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:44,266
Up next, Kim Chi.

792
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:47,967
Even though we fought
this awkward body movement thing

793
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,600
this whole season,

794
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,500
I think you‘ve really
gotten to a place

795
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,867
where you can work it now.

796
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,967
For avant-garde, you were
like a glamorous,

797
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,567
Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.

798
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,100
It was so captivating.

799
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
And seeing your journey
of self-acceptance

800
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,333
and your journey
to challenge yourself

801
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,266
has been really impressive.

802
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,934
As a matter of fact,
in your entire journey,

803
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,467
I don‘t think there was one look

804
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,467
that you didn‘t kill,

805
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,700
and tonight is just the cherry

806
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,567
on top of the hot fudge sundae.

807
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,166
Thank you for bringing
your artistry

808
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,533
to the main stage
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race."

809
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,867
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

810
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,967
You look absolutely
beautiful tonight.

811
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,200
Of course, it‘s iconic Cher
for us,

812
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,633
so it makes us super happy.

813
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,467
-[as Cher]
-Snap out of it.

814
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,367
You have brought it,

815
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:35,066
<i>and this music video</i>
<i>was no exception.</i>

816
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,066
For avant-garde, I want you
to look like an alien,

817
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:39,066
<i>and that blue look</i>
<i>with the white boots</i>

818
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,533
<i>gave that to me.</i>

819
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,533
And what I love most about you

820
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,934
is you‘re so sweet.

821
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:46,600
You‘re that great
combination of, like,

822
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,900
you‘re a fierce bitch that could
cut a bitch on the street,

823
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,233
but you‘re also, like,
a sweet little, like, kitten.

824
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,100
I‘m so happy to see you here,
because I think

825
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,066
you bring something
really special and unique.

826
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,700
You listened, you worked,

827
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,967
and it paid off.

828
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,100
We all have those moments

829
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,433
when you decide to, like,
bust through.

830
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,200
I can think of times
in my career...

831
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,333
it was hearing "No"

832
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,700
when I just said,
"Fuck y‘all.

833
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
I‘m in,"

834
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,266
and there was just a moment here

835
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:11,867
when you just said, "I am in."

836
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:15,600
Naomi, to say that you
are the surprise...

837
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,066
it‘s no exaggeration.

838
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:19,834
It‘s just as surprising
as Chi Chi for me.

839
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,100
This is not the final four
that I would have predicted

840
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,433
the first week
in the competition,

841
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,166
and you did it,
and you earned it.

842
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,266
I want to say this
to all the girls.

843
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,367
The theme of the winner‘s circle

844
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,967
is adaptability,

845
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,600
but at the same time
staying true

846
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,233
to your own unique frequency,

847
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,934
and that‘s the truth

848
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:38,967
not only in this competition

849
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,967
but in everything in life.

850
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:43,467
Taking those cues
from the universe

851
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,600
and applying them

852
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,266
but without losing who you are,

853
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,066
and each of you represent that,

854
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,233
and I am so proud
of each of you,

855
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,900
and that is why you‘re standing
on this stage today.

856
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,066
All right, ladies.

857
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,333
Final question.

858
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,567
Why should you,
and not your competitors,

859
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:02,567
be crowned America‘s
next drag superstar?

860
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,967
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

861
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,066
Bob The Drag Queen.

862
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,400
I have, statistically,
done the best

863
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
in this competition,

864
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,667
and you reward the person
who has done the best

865
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:11,934
with the highest reward.

866
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:14,166
I don‘t just do what I do
for me.

867
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,967
I literally do it
for anyone who can come

868
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,533
within range
of my obnoxious, raspy voice.

869
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,433
I serve the people.

870
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,066
I serve the community,
and more than just

871
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,133
doing stand-up comedy,

872
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,166
and actually getting
my hands and feet

873
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,100
into the dirt of the community

874
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,367
and helping it grow,

875
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,600
because the community
has helped me grow,

876
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,367
and it‘s made me who I am today.

877
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,066
Thank you.

878
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,066
All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.

879
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:39,100
I should be America‘s
next drag superstar

880
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,467
because I feel like I possess

881
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,100
the talent,
the willingness to grow,

882
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,667
the willingness to take
your critiques

883
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,967
and apply ‘em.

884
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,066
I can be funny just as well.

885
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,266
I can make costumes,

886
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,133
and I can beat this mug out too.

887
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,133
I can work a runway.

888
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,633
I can work a music video,

889
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,567
and I‘ve just blossomed,

890
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,533
and I feel like...
that I should be

891
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,867
America‘s next drag superstar,

892
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,467
because I‘ve shown
the most growth

893
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:06,467
out of--out of all
of these girls.

894
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,433
Thank you.

895
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:09,567
All right, next.

896
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,500
Kim Chi.

897
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,266
Throughout this
whole competition,

898
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,667
I have shown consistent

899
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,900
and creative and detailed looks.

900
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,400
I have been professional
and courteous

901
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,066
throughout this whole
experience.

902
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,667
I have been willing to adapt
to myself

903
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,467
in any situation I am in.

904
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,967
None of the girls will ever come
up with the stuff that I do.

905
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,066
I don‘t want to be America‘s
next drag superstar.

906
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,900
I am America‘s
next drag superstar.

907
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,567
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

908
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:35,100
All right, Naomi Smalls.

909
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,400
I love drag so much.

910
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,600
It is what, like, gets me up
in the morning,

911
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,300
and I have such a need
and a want to grow,

912
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,967
and I don‘t like
to pigeonhole myself

913
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:49,066
into just being either
a stand-up comedian

914
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,333
or a dancing queen
or a look queen.

915
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,133
I want to be able to do anything

916
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,967
and show everybody

917
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,066
that I can be successful

918
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:00,200
just being me
and loving who I am,

919
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
and that is everything
I want in the world.

920
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,033
Thank you.

921
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,166
Thank you.

922
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,333
Well, my queens,

923
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,200
I think we‘ve heard enough.

924
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,567
While you untuck backstage,

925
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:14,066
the judges and I
will deliberate.

926
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,667
Now, just between us
squirrel friends,

927
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:17,600
what do you think?

928
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,567
Now, y‘all were doing

929
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,967
a lot of praising up there,

930
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,233
and these kids have come
a long way.

931
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,567
I understand that,

932
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,066
but I need y‘all to get real
for the realness.

933
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,400
-You know what I‘m saying?
-I can get real.

934
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,533
-I‘ll break it down.
-You know?

935
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,333
‘Cause, hey, this is still
a competition,

936
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,333
and somebody
has to go home tonight.

937
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,333
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>

938
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,166
Spandex leggings...
not so much for best drag.

939
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,500
I would have loved
to have seen a gown.

940
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,567
The makeup has always been

941
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,967
-not great.
-Right.

942
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,433
There was some growth
with the looks,

943
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:46,200
but, you know, if I‘m buying
a ticket to Bob‘s show,

944
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,333
it‘s not to see glamour.

945
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,633
It‘s to be entertained.

946
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,400
She‘s been consistently smart

947
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,133
with her humor.

948
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,100
-The Snatch Game was stellar.
-Oh.

949
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,233
I also liked
the shady politics ad.

950
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,300
I thought that was really funny.

951
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,033
I think my number one
Bob moment

952
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,367
was "chocolate chip cookie."

953
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,533
Shut it down in the acting.

954
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:05,500
Really every challenge,
Bob rose to the occasion

955
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,567
and was able to inject
Bob The Drag Queen

956
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,467
into that challenge.

957
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,533
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>

958
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,100
Look at how far she‘s come.

959
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,266
She had to lip-sync
for her life twice,

960
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:19,166
and she not only saved herself,
she, like, killed it.

961
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,233
Like, we had
a "come to Jesus" meeting

962
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,133
during "I‘m Telling You
I‘m Not Going."

963
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,633
The Bitch Perfect challenge.

964
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,500
That was a high point.

965
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,333
She was upside down,
lip-syncing.

966
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,467
-Uh-huh.
-Twerking.

967
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,266
-Yes.
-I mean, come on.

968
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,100
<i>Also, the Book Ball</i>
<i>was a shining,</i>

969
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,533
glorious moment
for Chi Chi DeVayne.

970
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,233
<i>As great as she looked,</i>

971
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:40,233
looking at the four queens
on that stage today,

972
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,600
I didn‘t know
if she‘s as original

973
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
as the other ones, you know?

974
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,367
-Chi Chi I‘ve seen done before.
-Mm-hmm.

975
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,166
-But I‘m in love with Chi Chi.
-Right.

976
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,667
As a judge, I don‘t know
what to do with that.

977
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,233
She is one of the kids

978
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,567
who come from the sort of
backwoods of drag.

979
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,533
She doesn‘t have to do
the outfits

980
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,333
that people in big cities
come to expect,

981
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,600
but in this competition,

982
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,433
judges wanted to see more,

983
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:07,066
and she delivered more.

984
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:08,066
<i>Kim Chi.</i>

985
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,400
She can definitely
serve a look

986
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,734
better than nobody‘s business.

987
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:11,333
I loved the Wonderful

988
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,367
<i>-Wizard of Oz challenge.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

989
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,433
<i>And what she did with the</i>
<i>stripes, with the little woman,</i>

990
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,200
I thought it was really,
really smart.

991
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,433
When she did the Book Ball

992
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:22,066
<i>and created the paper wig</i>
<i>out of pink pieces of paper,</i>

993
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:22,934
it‘s phenomenal.

994
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:25,166
My favorite moment
with Kim Chi

995
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,233
was the first time I saw her,

996
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,066
and I thought, "What in the hell
am I looking at?"

997
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,100
The interesting thing for me
was watching the struggle

998
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,500
of not loving
who she is in her skin.

999
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,467
I kind of went through
a very similar thing

1000
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:36,367
when I did "Queer Eye."

1001
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,266
It was like that thing
that I was hiding.

1002
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,967
It was like, "Oh, my God,
you‘re the queer guy?"

1003
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,066
Then it was, like, celebrated,

1004
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,266
and you‘re like,
"Wait a minute."

1005
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,100
I think that‘s gonna happen
with her owning it

1006
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,066
and saying,
"Wait, I‘m being celebrated

1007
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,367
for who I am,
lisp and awkwardness,"

1008
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,166
and she will get there,

1009
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,066
but does she have the ability

1010
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:55,600
to command a stage
and work a crowd?

1011
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,100
I don‘t know.

1012
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,166
She has the capability

1013
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,433
-to change drag a little.
-Mm-hmm.

1014
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:01,533
-You know what I mean?
-Yes.

1015
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:04,834
To really sort of shift it
in a very new,

1016
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,166
-2000-something...
-Yes.

1017
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,266
Sort of way,
and I‘m curious to see

1018
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:10,333
where it goes.

1019
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,500
<i>All right, let‘s move on</i>
<i>to Naomi Smalls.</i>

1020
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,433
She has upped her game,

1021
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,233
and she has brought it to us

1022
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,333
on a different level.

1023
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,066
The Wizard of Oz moment

1024
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,500
<i>was such a game changer.</i>

1025
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,166
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-My God.</i>

1026
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,900
That was really
the turning point for her.

1027
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,400
-I mean, haute couture.
-Yeah.

1028
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,066
High-end fashion.

1029
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,867
Now, in the video,
I really loved

1030
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:31,967
-her avant-garde look.
-Mm-hmm.

1031
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,100
<i>I love that she knows</i>
<i>her brand.</i>

1032
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,066
I think the turning point
for me

1033
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,066
was in the black-and-white movie
runway look,

1034
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:41,066
<i>and she did that beautiful</i>
<i>gray makeup.</i>

1035
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,600
And then out she comes
in the Book Ball

1036
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,900
<i>in that paper dress,</i>

1037
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,100
<i>which was straight off</i>
<i>of a runway somewhere.</i>

1038
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,333
Her POV became OMG.

1039
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,467
-[laughing]
-For me.

1040
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:51,600
LOL.

1041
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,066
She‘s one that

1042
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,100
in a year or two
will be killing it,

1043
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,367
but I think she‘s just
not there yet.

1044
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,066
I don‘t believe that at all.

1045
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,333
-Really?
-We can all get better.

1046
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,300
But compared
to the other girls

1047
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,066
at this point in time,

1048
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,066
-I don‘t think she‘s there yet.
-I do.

1049
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:10,133
Her drag is really good
and polished.

1050
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,300
And she‘s fashion.

1051
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
She‘s posing,

1052
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,400
which gives me the chills
every time she does that thing

1053
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,934
that I wish I could do,
but my belly gets in the way.

1054
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,066
I--guess what I‘m about to say?

1055
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,333
-I agree with Michelle.
-[exclaims]

1056
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,667
-What?
-I know, I know.

1057
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:27,066
I know, but I...
I think what she did this season

1058
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,934
is worthy of being
in the top three

1059
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,233
and maybe even taking the crown.

1060
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,567
well, I‘ve just got to say

1061
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,166
for the room, you know,

1062
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,667
you guys have been
no help whatsoever.

1063
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,266
[all laughing]

1064
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,333
Silence!

1065
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,367

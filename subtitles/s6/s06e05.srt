- WANT SOME MONEY?

340
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,800
WANT A VIPER?

341
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,900
- I'VE GOT TO SAY,
DEATH REALLY BECOMES HER.

342
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,834
[LAUGHTER]

343
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:00,433
UP NEXT, IT'S THE FRENCH CHEF,
JULIA CHILD.

344
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,266
- OH, HELLO, RU,
HOW ARE YOU?

345
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,467
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING COOKING.

346
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,700
DID YOU BRING YOUR LOVIN' OVEN?

347
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,300
- I SURE DID.
IT'S RIGHT UNDER THIS DESK!

348
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,166
- ALL RIGHT.

349
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,467
MOVING ON DOWN
TO THE FIRST LADY OF QUEENS,

350
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,667
FRAN DRESCHER IS HERE.

351
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,200
- ARE YOU SINGLE MR. RUPAUL?
- I AM SINGLE, YES.

352
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,700
- BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
MY GIRLFRIEND, VAL,

353
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,400
EVER SINCE OBAMA GOT INTO POWER,
SHE'S BEEN LOCO FOR THE COCOA.

354
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,300
[LAUGHTER]

355
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,900
- STYLIST TO THE STARS,
RACHEL ZOE IS HERE!

356
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,567
- MIGHT I SAY I LITERALLY
DIE FOR YOUR OUTFIT.

357
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
- IS THAT REAL FUR
YOU'RE WEARING?

358
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,700
- IT'S MY NEW FUR FAUX LINE.

359
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:41,333
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
THE QUEEN OF SOUTHERN CUISINE,

360
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,100
MISS PAULA DEEN IS HERE!

361
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,333
- MY, YOU GORGEOUS
BALD-HEADED MAN.

362
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,367
- OH, YOU SWEET THING.

363
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,734
- WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR FUZZ

364
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,533
DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T
A PEACH, HONEY.

365
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,300
[LAUGHS]

366
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,433
WHAT DID SHE JUST CALL ME?

367
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:58,133
MEDIA SENSATION
KIM KARDASHIAN IS HERE.

368
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,867
HOW'S THE BABY?

369
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
- OH, YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL, LIKE,

370
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,433
HAVING SOME MORNING-AFTER--
IS THAT--

371
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,033
YES, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
THROWING UP AND STUFF

372
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,767
AFTER THE PREGNANCY,

373
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,300
BUT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OKAY.

374
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:16,467
- KIM, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- ABSOLUTELY.

375
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,066
- AND LOOK WHO'S HERE.

376
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
IT'S TERESA FROM "THE REAL
HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY."

377
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,133
HEY, GIRL.

378
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,133
- DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO PRONOUNCE MY LAST NAME?

379
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,800
- I DON'T,
I HAD A HARD TIME WITH IT.

380
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,200
- WELL, IT WAS JOO-DICE--

381
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,500
- UH-HUH.

382
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,600
- AND THEN, I REALIZED
IT WAS JOO-DEE-CHAY.

383
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:32,567
- UH-HUH.

384
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
- BUT WE WENT
ALL THE WAY BACK

385
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,300
TO THE OLD COUNTRY,

386
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,934
AND IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED--
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET IT.

387
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,233
JOHNSON.

388
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,834
[LAUGHTER]

389
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,934
- TERESA JOHNSON, EVERYBODY.

390
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:51,400
OKAY, WE HAVE TWO-TIME
ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS,

391
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,133
DAME MAGGIE SMITH IS WITH US.

392
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,600
HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR?

393
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,867
- WELL, PAST A CERTAIN AGE,
ONE JUST FEELS FORTUNATE

394
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,033
TO SEE THE SUN RISE ANOTHER DAY.

395
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,800
- YES, YES, MAGGIE SMITH.

396
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:07,700
- FOR NOW, LET'S JUST KEEP IT
MR. CHARLES AND DAME SMITH,

397
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,633
SHALL WE?

398
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,300
- YES, MA'AM.
- THANK YOU.

399
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,066
- NOW, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
PINK LADY,

400
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,200
NICKI MINAJ IS HERE.

401
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,233
- O-M-G. HI, RU.

402
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,800
- HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MARIAH AT ALL?

403
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,867
[LAUGHTER]

404
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,166
- NO.

405
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,133
- ALL RIGHT,

406
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,567
ARE YOU READY
TO PLAY THE SNATCH GAME?

407
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,066
- OH, SHIT,
IT'S THE SNATCH GAME.

408
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,700
AAH!

409
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:32,800
- COMING UP--

410
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,166
- I'M SWEATING LIKE TWO RATS

411
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,467
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.

412
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,767
[LAUGHTER]

413
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,033
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.
- BALONEY!

414
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,667
- THAT'S REALLY RUDE.
- I'M TALKING!

415
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,900
- [LAUGHS]

416
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,667
- [LAUGHS]

417
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,734
WELCOME BACK TO SNATCH GAME.

418
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,033
NOW, HERE'S HOW
THE GAME WORKS, LADIES.

419
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,367
I ASK A QUESTION,

420
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,934
OUR CELEBRITY CONTESTANTS
FILL IN THE BLANKS,

421
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,500
AND YOU GIVE AN ANSWER
THAT YOU THINK WILL MATCH.

422
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,533
FIRST UP, HEATHER MCDONALD.

423
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,967
CHER IS COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA.

424
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,433
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.

425
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,500
- I SAID, "EVEN HER WIG
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT."

426
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,934
- LET'S GO TO THE STARS

427
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,600
AND FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WROTE DOWN.

428
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,633
JUDGE JUDY.

429
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,667
- HER OLD NOSE.

430
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,734
- NOT A MATCH,
UNFORTUNATELY, BUT--

431
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,433
- SHE--IT HAS BEEN
LIKE 3 OR 4.

432
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,767
- YEAH, SHE'S BEEN TOUCHED
BY AN ANGEL.

433
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,633
- YEAH.
- AND SHE LOOKS GREAT.

434
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,734
- I AGREE, AND YOU KNOW,

435
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:31,000
I AGREE,
AND SO DOES OFFICER BYRD.

436
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,834
[IMITATING BYRD]
THAT IS CORRECT, JUDGE JUDY.

437
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,934
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.

438
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:35,967
- BALONEY.
[LAUGHTER]

439
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,333
BALONEY, SIR.

440
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,867
- I'M READY FOR A FRIED BOLOGNA
SANDWICH, MYSELF.

441
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,734
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH.

442
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,133
- I SEE THAT HER HAIR
CHANGES ALL THE TIME.

443
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,133
- YES, IT DOES.

444
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,867
- AND IT HAS, LIKE,
A MIND OF ITS OWN.

445
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,967
- YES, IT DOES.

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,033
- SO, I PUT "HAIR,"
AND I THINK I WON SOMETHING.

447
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:58,000
- YES. YES, YOU DID.
[LAUGHTER]

448
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,133
- THAT'S A MATCH.
- YES.

449
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,367
- WHAT DO I WIN?

450
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,633
- WELL, WE'LL TELL YOU
IN A MINUTE, ANNA NICOLE.

451
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,567
- OKAY.

452
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO RACHEL ZOE.

453
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,300
- I WROTE "SHOES,"
BECAUSE SHOES

454
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,900
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORY
TO A WOMEN'S OUTFIT.

455
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,066
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ME,
RACHEL ZOE,

456
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,433
TO GET YOUR SHOES STYLED.

457
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,433
- UH, RU?
- YES?

458
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,100
- IS THIS GIRL
OVER THERE A ROBOT?

459
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,133
WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE THAT?
IS SOMEBODY PUSHING A BUTTON?

460
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,500
CAN YOU TALK NORMAL?

461
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,900
- I'M ACTUALLY OVERWORKED--
- I'M TALKING, I'M TALKING!

462
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,066
AND, UM, I THINK
THAT'S REALLY RUDE.

463
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,567
- IS THAT REALLY
HOW RACHEL ZOE TALKS?

464
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
NO? OH...

465
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,467
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

466
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,934
- ALL RIGHT, DAME MAGGIE SMITH,

467
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,066
CHER, COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA,

468
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,533
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.

469
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:43,033
- WELL, RUPLE--RUPLE, IS IT?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

470
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:46,200
- I UNDERSTOOD VIRTUALLY
NONE OF THE WORDS

471
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,033
THAT LEFT YOUR LIPS
MOMENTS AGO,

472
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,433
BUT I DID HEAR
THE TERM "TWITTER,"

473
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,800
AND I ASSUME THAT IT'S
SOME SORT OF SONGBIRD?

474
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,100
- VERY CLOSE, NOT A MATCH.

475
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,433
- AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ONE YANKS ONE'S TELEPHONE

476
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,967
RIGHT OUT OF THE WALLS
AND CARRIES IT WITH HIM?

477
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,266
[LAUGHTER]
- YES.

478
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
- RU, COULD YOU GET PEOPLE
THAT SPEAK NORMAL ENGLISH

479
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,767
NEXT TIME FOR THE SHOW?

480
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
- EXCUSE ME,
WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE!

481
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,233
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, OKAY.

482
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,767
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
GILLIAN JACOBS.

483
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
IS SO GAY,

484
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:18,266
INSTEAD OF HORSES,

485
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,033
THEIR MOUNTED POLICE
RIDE "BLANK."

486
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,166
- I SAID, "BEARS."
- WHY NOT RIDE A BEAR?

487
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,900
- I KNOW YOU LIKE A BEAR.
- I LOVE A BEAR.

488
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:28,233
- I'M SWEATING
LIKE TWO RATS

489
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,800
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.

490
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,834
- OH, DEAR.
- OH MY.

491
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,433
- LET'S SEE
IF YOU GOT ANY MATCHES

492
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,533
WITH OUR STARS.

493
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,066
JULIA CHILD.

494
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,100
- I HAD ALWAYS HEARD
THAT SAN FRANCISCO WAS--

495
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,867
THERE WAS A SAUSAGE FEST
ALL YEAR ROUND.

496
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,834
- YEAR-ROUND.

497
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,100
- AND SO, THEY MUST HAVE
ALL THESE TRUCKS

498
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,567
TO DELIVER THESE SAUSAGES.

499
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,533
- I'M SURE THEY MUST, YES.

500
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,600
- AND SO, I SAY,
"SAUSAGE TRUCKS."

501
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,533
- MILK AIN'T NO MERYL STREEP.

502
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,133
- ALL RIGHT, KIM KARDASHIAN,
SAN FRANCISCO IS SO GAY,

503
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,400
INSTEAD OF HORSES,
THE MOUNTED POLICE RIDE--

504
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,567
- WELL, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,

505
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
YOU NEVER PUT A TATTOO
ON A BENTLEY,

506
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,500
AND I HOPE THAT I--

507
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,500
- A BENTLEY.

508
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:06,467
- SPELLED IT RIGHT.

509
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,867
- YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T.

510
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,533
- BEAUTY FADES,
DUMB IS FOREVER.

511
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,233
- UP NEXT,
WE'VE GOT TERESA

512
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,500
FROM "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF NEW JERSEY."

513
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,500
WHAT DO THEY RIDE?

514
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,367
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.

515
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,066
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT A MATCH.

516
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
- CAN I HAVE A PINOT GRIGIO?

517
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,800
- PINOT GRIGIO, COMING RIGHT UP.

518
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,066
ALL RIGHT, NICKI MINAJ,
OH MY GOODNESS,

519
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,166
YOU'VE GOT A HAIRSTYLE CHANGE.

520
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,367
- YES.
- LOVE IT, THAT'S GORGEOUS.

521
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,900
- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO WRITE ANYTHING DOWN

522
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:35,300
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO CHANGE MY WIG.

523
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,400
- OH, OKAY.
- WIG CHANGES.

524
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,433
- HOW ORIGINAL.

525
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,500
CHAD MICHAELS,
HOW MANY YEARS AGO?

526
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,567
- YOU DIDN'T
WRITE DOWN ANYTHING?

527
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,900
- NO.

528
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,200
- PERHAPS SHE NEEDS ANOTHER POT
OF INK TO REPLENISH HER QUILL.

529
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,700
[LAUGHTER]

530
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,433
- ALL RIGHT, HEATHER.

531
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,300
THAT CHELSEA HANDLER
IS SO WRONG.

532
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:57,266
SHE'S LAUNCHING A NEW VODKA.
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."

533
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,033
- XANAX.
- XANAX. WHAT A GREAT IDEA!

534
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,500
OKAY, LET'S GO ON OVER
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH

535
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,066
TO SEE IF SHE MATCHED YOU.

536
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,400
- WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
A DRINKER.

537
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,467
- RIGHT.

538
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,000
- BUT I'VE TASTED VODKA
A COUPLE OF TIMES

539
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,734
IN MY LIFE,
AND I LIKE IT BY ITSELF.

540
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:16,834
- [LAUGHS]

541
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:19,500
- SO, I JUST PUT "VODKA."

542
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,266
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S NOT MATCH,

543
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
BUT THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER,
ANNA NICOLE.

544
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,300
- KIMMY!

545
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,300
[LAUGHTER]

546
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,600
- FRAN DRESCHER.

547
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:31,166
CHELSEA HANDLER'S LAUNCHING
A NEW VODKA FLAVORED WITH...

548
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,233
- I SAID "ALCOHOL."
[LAUGHS]

549
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,834
- I KNOW I CAN DO A BETTER
FRAN DRESCHER THAN COURTNEY.

550
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:41,266
OH, MR. SHEFFIELD.
HA HA HA HA.

551
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,767
- LET'S MOVE
ON TO KIM KARDASHIAN.

552
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,600
- NEW VODKA,
FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."

553
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:50,233
- I'D HAVE TO GO
WITH "BIG BLACK"--

554
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,166
- KARDASHIAN,
YOU WANT TO DATE HIM?

555
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,900
- YES, DEAR?
OH!

556
00:21:55,934 --> 00:22:00,100
- SHE'S A REAL KEEPER,
AS IN "KEEP 'ER IN A CAGE."

557
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:03,266
- ALL RIGHT, TERESA,
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."

558
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,333
- CUMM-IN.

559
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,467
- OH, YOU MEAN CUMIN.
- CUMM-IN.

560
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,166
- YEAH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"CUE-MIN."

561
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,166
- CUMM-IN.

562
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,166
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

563
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,800
LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DAME MAGGIE SMITH.

564
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,700
- WELL, I'M UNFAMILIAR
WITH THE WORK OF LADY HANDLER,

565
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:21,600
HOWEVER, I DID THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE RATHER AMUSING

566
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,367
IF THERE WERE LIBATIONS
FLAVORED WITH CITRUS.

567
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,066
[LAUGHTER]

568
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,767
CAN YOU IMAGINE SUCH A THING?

569
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,633
- THAT IS REALLY NEWFANGLED.

570
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,567
I CAN'T IMAGINE SUCH A THING.

571
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,000
- YES.
[LAUGHTER]

572
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,633
- OH, I'M SORRY,
TIME IS UP,

573
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,233
WHICH MEANS,
OUR WINNER IS...

574
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:45,433
WHO CARES?

575
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:48,734
THIS IS RUPAUL REMINDING YOU
TO SPAY AND NEUTER

576
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,367
YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

577
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,500
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

578
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:52,834

579
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:53,767
- BYE!

580
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,967
- Y'ALL COME BACK, NOW,
YOU HEAR?

581
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,200
- COMING UP--

582
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,133
SHE WAS REALLY CHANNELING HER.

583
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,300
- IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.

584
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,233
- IT'S THE TIGHTEST
SNATCH GAME IN HISTORY.

585
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,633
[LAUGHTER]

586
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,000

- [LAUGHS]

588
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,233
- MEOW.

589
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:17,433
- TONIGHT'S RUNWAY THEME
IS "NIGHT OF A THOUSAND RUS."

590
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:20,333
WE HAVE TO DRESS UP AS RUPAUL,
WHICH IS EXCITING,

591
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:24,000
BUT RUPAUL
IS GOING TO BE IN THE ROOM, SO--

592
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,767
- AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S, LIKE,

593
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,867
HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH, LIKE, MY BODY?

594
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,834
MY FRIENDS AND I KID AROUND
ABOUT, LIKE--

595
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,166
WE CALL IT "HOG BODY."

596
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,834
JUST, LIKE, WE'RE REALLY THICK
IN THE MIDSECTION.

597
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,033
- DO YOU FEEL OVERWEIGHT?

598
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,166
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRD-PROPORTIONED BODY.

599
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,800
- WELL MAYBE YOU DO.
AND SO WHAT?

600
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,133
- YEAH.

601
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,233
I HAVE LOTS TO SAY ABOUT WEIGHT.

602
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:46,500
I WAS VERY HEAVY
ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL.

603
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,867
AND I WAS TEASED MERCILESSLY
ABOUT IT,

604
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,934
FOR BEING GAY AND BEING FAT.

605
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:56,200
IT AFFECTED MY SELF-CONFIDENCE
SO PROFOUNDLY.

606
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:59,567
I JUST FELT COMPLETELY UNLOVABLE
FOR SO MANY YEARS

607
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,700
BECAUSE OF THAT.

608
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:04,900
MY MOM, SHE'D BEEN
SORT OF THE BIG PROPONENT

609
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:08,000
OF ME BEING MYSELF,
AND THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

610
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:11,200
AND THEN, WHEN I WAS 13,
MY MOM DIED.

611
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,667
I JUST--

612
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:22,767
THAT REALLY THREW ME
INTO A TAILSPIN.

613
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,967
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT VOICE SAYING
THAT WHO I WAS WAS OKAY ANYMORE.

614
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,333
I JUST HAD A LOT OF VOICES
AT SCHOOL

615
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:30,166
SAYING THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME WAS WRONG.

616
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,033
TOO FAT, TOO GAY, TOO WEIRD.

617
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:35,166
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER EXPECTED
TO HAPPEN

618
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,734
WAS THAT I LEARNED A LOT
FROM MY DRAG CHARACTER

619
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,433
THAT I COULD BRING
TO MY BOY SELF.

620
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,700
- RIGHT.

621
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,834
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME

622
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,333
IN THOSE YEARS,
BUT I HAVE LEARNED

623
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:51,667
TO USE THE HARDSHIP
TO GET STRONGER.

624
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,900
- ADORE.
- YES, BABY?

625
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,433
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
YELLED AT BY MICHELLE,

626
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,567
BECAUSE DIDN'T
SHE SAY LAST TIME

627
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,867
THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE CINCHED?
- YEAH.

628
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,800
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,

629
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,333
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER

630
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,700
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.

631
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,467
- I'M DOWN.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.

632
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,867
- I'M REALLY GRATEFUL
FOR BIANCA'S

633
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,367
MOTHERLY KIND OF INSTINCT.

634
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,233

I'M PLUMMETING THE RUNWAY

00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:49,033

IT'S WORKROOM RU.

00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,600
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN THIS

741
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,867
I AM WORKING MY ASCOT OFF.

742
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,834

A KLEIN EPSTEIN PARKER SUIT?

743
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,066
LADY LOOKS LIKE A DUDE.

A LOT COULD BE FORGIVEN
IF YOU WERE FUNNY,

747
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,300
BUT YOU WERE NOT FUNNY.

748
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,834
- I AM EXTREMELY OFFENDED

749
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:07,967
THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
ON THE RUNWAY IN PANTS.

750
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,767

00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,567

YOU'RE SAFE.

758
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,734
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.

759
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:38,834
LADIES, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.

760
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,533
LET'S START WITH GIA GUNN.
- HI.

761
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:43,100
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE SNATCH GAME.

762
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,400
THIS IS SEASON 6.

763
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:48,567
YOU DON'T PICK A CELEBRITY
WITH NOT A BIG PERSONALITY.

764
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,200
IT WAS FLAT.

765
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,834
- WHEN I SPOKE WITH YOU
IN THE WORKROOM,

766
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,433
YOU WERE GONNA DO SELENA.

767
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:54,767
WHY'D YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

768
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,734
- BECAUSE SHE IS NOT
A COMEDY CHARACTER.

769
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:01,066
- BUT THAT JUST DAWNED ON YOU
IN THE WORKROOM?

770
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,000
LISTEN, A LOT COULD BE FORGIVEN
IF YOU WERE FUNNY,

771
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:06,400
BUT YOU WERE NOT FUNNY.

772
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:09,100
NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

773
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,900
- HI, MAMA RU.
- RACHEL ZOE.

774
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:11,900
YOU WERE PLAYING, LIKE,

775
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,166
THE CHICKEN LADY
FROM "KIDS IN THE HALL."

776
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,767
THERE WAS A LOT
OF THIS KIND OF--

777
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
- I AGREE.
- IT DIDN'T WORK.

778
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,400
- RACHEL ZOE IS KNOWN
FOR SO MANY CATCHPHRASES

779
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,467
THAT I MIGHT WRITE
A CHEAT SHEET.

780
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,033
- I DID.
- YOU DID?

781
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,600
- I DEFINITELY GOT
IN MY HEAD IN THIS ONE.

782
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,800
I SAW MY SISTERS
REALLY SUCCEEDING.

783
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,000
INSTEAD OF PUSHING
MORE FORWARD, I SUNK BACK.

784
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,233
- YOU'RE TALENTED,
SO IT HURTS TO SEE IT.

785
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,467
- IT HURTS ME, TOO.

786
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,767
- UP NEXT, BIANCA DEL RIO.
LOVE THAT DRESS.

787
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,667
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.
- [LAUGHS]

788
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,233
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR A QUEEN TO DO JUDGE JUDY.

789
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,467
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

790
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,200
- WELL IT DOES HELP THAT
I'M A JUDGMENTAL BITCH, TOO.

791
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,867
[LAUGHTER]
THAT DOES KIND OF HELP.

792
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,133
- YOU WERE ABLE TO INTERACT
WITH THE OTHER QUEENS.

793
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,533
IT WAS FABULOUS.

794
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,133
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.

795
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,700
- THERE IS NOTHING RUPAUL
ABOUT THAT WIG,

796
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,567
NOR THE LOOK, QUITE HONESTLY.

797
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,033
- I WAS DOING ADORE
INSPIRED BY RUPAUL.

798
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,633
- YEAH, YOU WERE DOING ADORE.

799
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,100
AND I THINK THIS LENGTH IS GOING
TO BE A RUNNING THEME FOR YOU.

800
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:06,133
BUT I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR CINCHING YOUR WAIST.

801
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,266
IT CHANGES YOUR BODY COMPLETELY.

802
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,200
YOU NEED TO START DOING THIS
ALL THE TIME.

803
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,867
- I CAN FEEL MY HEART
IN MY THROAT,

804
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,867
AND IT TASTES AMAZING!

805
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,367
[LAUGHTER]

806
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,867
- YOUR ANNA NICOLE SMITH,
GUESS AD, '94 REALNESS

807
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,400
WAS PERFORMANCE ART.

808
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,600
- UP NEXT, DELA.

809
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,066
- I LOVE THIS YELLOW LOOK.
IT'S REALLY WELL-DONE.

810
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,900
- I DON'T EVEN WATCH
"DOWNTON ABBEY,"

811
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,033
AND I WAS DYING
OVER MAGGIE SMITH.

812
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:30,533
- YEAH, LIKE, WHEN YOU SAID,
"WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE,"

813
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,367
THAT WAS, LIKE,
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS

814
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,166
I HEARD ALL DAY YESTERDAY,

815
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,700
AND I THINK I SAID IT
ABOUT 6 TIMES AFTER I LEFT.

816
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,633
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.

817
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,734
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

818
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:41,867
- [LAUGHS]

819
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,233
- PART OF ME, MILK,
IS EXTREMELY OFFENDED

820
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:47,667
THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
ON THE RUNWAY IN PANTS.

821
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,567
PART OF ME THINKS IT'S GENIUS
BECAUSE IT IS RUPAUL.

822
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,066
- WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
WHAT I LOVE--

823
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,800
I LOVE GOING FOR THE UNEXPECTED.

824
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,867
- BUT THIS
DOESN'T SHOCK ME, REALLY.

825
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,767
WHAT WOULD SHOCK ME
IS IF YOU HAD COME OUT HERE

826
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,633
AND DONE SOMETHING
SO AMAZINGLY GLAM,

827
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,567
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.

828
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,867
- I COULD GO MORE GLAM,

829
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,166
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
STAYING TRUE TO MY AESTHETIC.

830
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,500
- BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU AS GLAMAZON.

831
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,633
- HONESTLY, SOMETIMES,
I DO FEEL THAT,

832
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,667
IF I WERE TO PUT ON
A BEAUTIFUL DRESS

833
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,967
LIKE THESE GIRLS
AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR LIKE THEM,

834
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,100
I WOULD STAND OUT
FOR THE WRONG REASONS,

835
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,200
AND PEOPLE WOULD
JUST LAUGH OF ME,

836
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:26,533
AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO LAUGH AT MYSELF.

837
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,233
- BUT IT'S HARD TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

838
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,834
WHO DOESN'T SHOW
THAT VULNERABILITY

839
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:32,200
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF.

840
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,500
LADIES, THANK YOU.

841
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,266
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,

842
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,367
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

843
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
RUPAUL IMPERSONATORS,

844
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,266
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

845
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,066
IT'S THE TIGHTEST SNATCH GAME
IN HISTORY.

846
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,166
- I AGREE, AND I SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT TIGHT SNATCH GAMES.

847
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,800
- I DON'T THINK SO, MICHELLE.

848
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,500
[LAUGHTER]

849
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:55,400
- LET'S START
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO.

850
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,700
- HER JUDGE JUDY,
IT WAS WELL-RESEARCHED,

851
00:33:57,734 --> 00:33:59,100
SHE STAYED IN CHARACTER.

852
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,600
IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.

853
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:02,667
- BUT I DIDN'T THINK

854
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,333
THAT SHE WAS
THE BEST RU LOOK.

855
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:05,633
YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT IT

856
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,600
AND GO "OH, MY GOD,

857
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:07,867
THAT JUST REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF RUPAUL."

858
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,533
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

859
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:14,166
- WHAT SHE WAS GIVING
IS YOUR THIN BOD, YOU KNOW,

860
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,500
INTERGALACTIC LOOK.

861
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:18,367
YEAH, IT WASN'T ALL GOLD,
IT WAS PURPLE AND BLACK,

862
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,734
BUT I DIDN'T MIND HER LOOK,
TONIGHT, ON THE RUNWAY.

863
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,934
- FOR ME, HER RACHEL ZOE
WAS MORE WILLIAM SHATNER

864
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:24,867
THAN RACHEL ZOE.

865
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,667
- OOH, THAT'S HOT.
- RIGHT?

866
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,800
- I REALLY THINK THE NERVES
GOT THE BEST OF HER.

867
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,667
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ADORE DELANO.

868
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,367
THAT ANNA NICOLE SMITH--
I WAS HYPNOTIZED.

869
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,767
I KNEW ANNA NICOLE SMITH,

870
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,333
AND SHE WAS REALLY
CHANNELING HER.

871
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,900
- BUT WHEN SHE CAME OUT,
SUPPOSEDLY BEING YOU,

872
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,333
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
KIND OF STILL DOING

873
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,633
A LITTLE BIT OF
ANNA NICOLE, LIKE--

874
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,633
- [LAUGHS]

875
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,266
- I THINK SHE REALLY
HAS BEEN ACTING

876
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,533
LIKE ANNA NICOLE HER WHOLE LIFE,

877
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,967
AND THEN I DIDN'T THINK
THE IMPRESSION WAS AS AMAZING

878
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,667
AS I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE OTHER DAY.

879
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,066
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.

880
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,133
- I THINK SHE WAS SUPERIOR
IN THE LOOK OF RU,

881
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,367
AND ALSO IN THE CHARACTER
OF MAGGIE SMITH.

882
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,066
- I WOULD AGREE.
HER COMEBACKS WERE SO FUNNY.

883
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,333
- BUT THE CON FOR ME WAS,
IT WAS ANOTHER OLD LADY.

884
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,300
- AH, THAT'S RIGHT,
THAT'S HER FORTE.

885
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,467
- NOT THAT IT WASN'T BRILLIANT,
BUT I FELT WE SAW IT ALREADY.

886
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,667
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO GIA GUNN.

887
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,000
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
A HALLOWEEN COSTUME IN A BAG--

888
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:18,700
THAT WIG, AND THE
WONKY EYE WITH THE EYELASH.

889
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,467
- CRACK HO.
[LAUGHTER]

890
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,033
- AND COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A WORSE CHARACTER

891
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,300
TO DO ON SNATCH GAME.

892
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,400
- YOU COULD DO KIM KARDASHIAN.

893
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,500
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.

894
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,934
- I CONCUR.

895
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,033
WHERE WERE THE BOOBIES,
WHERE WAS THE ASS?

896
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,900
SHE COULD HAVE STARTED
EVERY LETTER WITH A "K."

897
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:35,066
- THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA,
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY.

898
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
- SHE JUST DIDN'T
REALLY GO FOR IT.

899
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,166
- ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, MILK!

900
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,600
- WELL, I COULD SEE THE WHEELS
TURNING EVERY MOMENT

901
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:43,967
OF THE JULIA CHILD.

902
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,500
- I THINK SHE MADE A REALLY
POOR CHOICE BEING BOY RU,

903
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:51,266
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TO SEE
ALL DIFFERENT SIDES OF A QUEEN.

904
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
- BUT I SEE THIS CONFLICT
IN MILK

905
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,533
BETWEEN WANTING TO STAY TRUE

906
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,367
TO THIS GENDER-BENDING,
WHICH I RESPECT,

907
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,567
BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME
I'VE HEARD A DRAG QUEEN

908
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
ON THIS SHOW SAY,

909
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,533
"I NEED TO STAY TRUE
TO MY DRAG,"

910
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,533
THEY GO HOME
VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

911
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,500
[LAUGHTER]

912
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,567
- SILENCE.

913
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,600
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.

914
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,834
- [LAUGHS]

915
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,567
- [LAUGHS]

916
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,266
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

917
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,867
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.

918
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,467
- TONIGHT,

919
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,934
IT'S THE PRIME
OF MISS BENDELACREME.

920
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:33,867
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.

921
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,233
- THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH.

922
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:41,667
- YOU'VE WON TWO COUTURE OUTFITS
FROM SYREN LATEX,

923
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,133
A LEADER IN LATEX FASHION.

924
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:47,266
- I'M THE FIRST ONE
TO WIN TWO CHALLENGES,

925
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,633
AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
THAT I WAS MOST TERRIFIED ABOUT,

926
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,900
AND I WON IT!

927
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:56,166
- BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU'RE SAFE.

928
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,900
ADORE, YOU'RE SAFE.

929
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,567
MILK,

930
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,500
YOUR JULIA CHILD IMPERSONATION

931
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:08,800
WAS HALF-BAKED.

932
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:11,467
GIA GUNN, AS KIM KARDASHIAN,

933
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,900
YOU FELL FLAT ON YOUR ASS.

934
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,600
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
YOUR RACHEL ZOE

935
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:24,200
WAS SO FASHION WEAK,
LITERALLY.

936
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,266
MILK, YOU ARE SAFE.

937
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,533
- THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT.

938
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,300
MILK BELONGS IN THE BOTTOM.

939
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:42,700
- BUT JUST BY THE SEAT
OF MY PANTS.

940
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:44,433
GIA AND LAGANJA,

941
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:48,934
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.

942
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,667
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.

943
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,300
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME,

944
00:37:56,333 --> 00:38:00,300
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.

945
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:04,700
THE TIME HAS COME

946
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,033
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC

947
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,633
FOR YOUR LIFE.

948
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,400
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M IN THE BOTTOM TWO,

949
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:16,300
AND I'M UP AGAINST
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS

950
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,500
IN THIS COMPETITION,

951
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,767
AND THAT REALLY SUCKS.

952
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,433

986
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,200

00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,900
MY PET, MAKE NO MISTAKE,

988
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,800

I'M UPSET THAT THERE'S OTHER
CROSSDRESSERS STILL IN THERE

993
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,500
THAT FUCKING CAME TO A DRAG SHOW
DRESSED AS BOYS.

994
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:30,033
I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK UP "DRAG,"
DRAG MEANS DRESSING UP AS GIRLS,

995
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,700
NOT RE-ENHANCING
WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE,

996
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,133

00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:44,800

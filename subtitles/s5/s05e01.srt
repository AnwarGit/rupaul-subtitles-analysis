00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,367
- At least Serena
was wearing panties.

360
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,433
Okay.

361
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:26,467
- Okay, there's a pole.

362
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,100
- Hold on to the pole.

363
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,934
Lookit.
It looks like frog legs.

364
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,667
[RuPaul laughing]

365
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,367
- What the fuck
was that about, guys?

366
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,633
- It's not
your<i> quinceanera</i><span style="bodyStyle"> anymore, is it?</i>

367
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:39,900
- Your<i> quinceanera</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is ruined!</i>

368
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,867
- By a pool.

369
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:41,867
- I'm not tucked.

370
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,166
- Oh, you didn't tuck?

371
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,300
- I'm not tucked at all,

372
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,600
so the dress is doing this
the whole time.

373
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,066
- Showing all your bubblegum
and everything.

374
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,667
- See, you thought you were
being cutesie

375
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,066
by being comfortable
with your non-tuck,

376
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,967
and they got you together.

377
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,200
<i>I'm not a fan of girls</i>
<i>who don't tuck.</i>

378
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,500
<i>Look like a woman.</i>

379
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
It's female impersonation
at the end of the day.

380
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,767
- Deeper!

381
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,600
Don't be so shallow, Alyssa.

382
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
Your legs look like calamari

383
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,734
when you do that.

384
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:09,934
- Okay.

385
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,166
- Dance underwater.

386
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,600
Is that dress wash and wear?

387
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,700
- Whew!

388
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,500
- Careful on these
wet, slippery surfaces.

389
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,767
Oh!
Queen down.

390
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,533
- At least I did it gracefully.

391
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,533
- Very.

392
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:31,166
- Jinkx Monsoon, welcome to
the drag lagoon!

393
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,633
- I don't know how to swim.

394
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,300
I learned how to swim
by one of my uncles

395
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,767
pushing me off a log
into a river.

396
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:46,300
First time under the water,
I lost both my contacts.

397
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,266
I was blinded within seconds.

398
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,667
- Okay, you look a little scared
underwater.

399
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,200
- A more pretty face.

400
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,467
- Okay, too much splashing.

401
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,266
Uh-oh.

402
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,133
You're splashing aroun--oops.

403
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,133
- [gasping]

404
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,400
- Are you okay?

405
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,066
- Just a little tang--

406
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,900
[spits] Tangled.

407
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,633
- I think we're gonna
have to call it a wrap.

408
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,233
- Jinkx, there's got to be
a morning after.

409
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,667
Deeper, Penny Tration.

410
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,600
Girl, you're gonna put
Shelley Winters out of work.

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,900
- [laughs]

412
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,233
- Oh, wait a minute.

413
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,700
- And go.

414
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,667
- Yes, yes, yes!

415
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,800
<i>Poseidon Adventure,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darling.</i>

416

- Yes!

419
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,233
- Touch all of the skin.

420
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:42,667
The filet of Vivienne Pinay.

421
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,233
Oh, Alaska's underwater.

422
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,367
Damn you, global warming!

423
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,567
- Oh!

424
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,467
- Okay. Yeah, your head's not
going very deep.

425
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,066
- And keep your hair
out of your face.

426
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,533
- I can't get deep enough.

427
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,600
I don't know how to do it.

428
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,066
- Alaska--she got really
frustrated, and it showed.

429
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,367
Push yourself down.

430
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,667
Go!

431
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:11,967
No.

432
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,400
Nope--on your face.
- Oh!

433
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
- All right, all right.

434
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,200
- I can't do it.
I failed.

435
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:21,734
- We will offer you one more dip
if you wanna take it.

436
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:23,066
- I'm sorry.

437
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,834
That was terrible!

438
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,467
[laughter]

439
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,066
I can't believe that.
I'm in shock.

440
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,800
I did so bad!

441
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
I don't know how to swim.

442
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,600
- Oh, get that.

443
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,066
-<i> I've completely blown it.</i>

444
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,300
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

445
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,100
- It's Honey Mahogany!

446
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,066
Honey, I sunk the kids.

447
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,667
Ooh! That was pretty.

00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,433
Throwing caution to the wind.

450

Fishy when wet.

Monica Beverly Hillz.

452
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,967
- Push your dress down
when you get underwater.

453
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,934
- You look like a jellyfish.

454
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:09,500
In the future, you should
hand-wash your woolens.

455
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,166
Oh...yes!

456
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,767
- All right!

457
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,133
Lineysha's body language
was so incredibly graceful

458
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,266
and dancerly;
it was amazing.

459
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,767
- Sparkle, Lineysha, sparkle!

460
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:24,467
Sorry to say, that satin will
never be the same.

461

- Yes, mama.

467

Instant Coco--just add water.

468
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,467
- Okay, y'all, somebody forgot
to tell them...

469

- [laughs]

470
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,533

472
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,900

- Y'all look cute.

475
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,900
- Seeing everybody de-dragging
for the very first time

476
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,467
is always exciting.

477
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,500
Detox--immediately, I'm like,
"Work done!"

478
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,967

Why does she have
an eye patch?

483
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,834
What is going on?

484
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:13,967
Oh, my God!

485
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,166
- I saw you sleeping earlier.

486
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,066
I was like, "Maybe she's just
really tired."

487
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,467
- I have narcolepsy.

488
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,333
So if I don't like stay active,
I start to slunk,

489
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,333
and then it's a whole big mess.

490
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,800
- Wait, Miss Thing.

491
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,767
So you fall asleep
out of nowhere?

492
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,400
- It's not how they do it
in the movies.

493
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,100
You know, like,
you can feel it coming on,

494
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,800
and if you're lucky, you make
your way to a sofa and...

495
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,600
[laughs]

496
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,100

Now, Mike and I have reviewed
your photos,

513
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:28,400
and some of you were in
over your heads.

514
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,767
- Yes!

515
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:33,367
- But some of you took to it
like a fish to water.

00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,700
- Fish!

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:40,433

00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,533
'Cause we've been in
competition.

718
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,567
- We have been in a lot of
competitions.

719
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,734
- And at the end of the day,

720
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:05,900
it's like you really, truly find

721
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,600
who your friends are
in the end.

722
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,066
- Yeah. That's true.

723
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,400
- That's what it's about.

724
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,467
- So we'll talk about it later,
Alyssa.

725
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,367
- We don't got nothing
to talk about.

726
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,700
- We do have--we have a lot to
talk about.

727
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,900
You say you'll find out later
who your friends are.

728
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,567
So you and I will sit down
and talk about that.

729
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:24,500
- I wanna know what the fuck
happened.

730
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,734
- When are you gonna tell me?
- Not gonna answer that.

731
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:28,400
When I'm ready.

732
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,867
-<i> I'm definitely feeling</i>
<i>the pressure because</i>

733
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:40,066
I floundered
in the dunk tank.

734
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,433
<i>So hopefully, I can redeem</i>
<i>myself.</i>

735
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,400
-<i> Alaska's a one-trick pony</i>
<i>at this point,</i>

736
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
<i>because yet again,</i>

737
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,200
she's making another dress
out of plastic bags.

738
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
- Saran Wrap?

739
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,266
<i>It's red carpet, honey.</i>

740
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,834
This might get you
on the bottom two.

741
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,567
Good luck.

742
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,166
-<i> Coming up...</i>

743
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,066
- I just wanted to keep it
kinda classy.

744
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,066
- Yeah.

745
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,433
There's a lot of influences
there.

746
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:17,066
- This is my plastic
evening gown.

747
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,700
I just see it in my brain.

748
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,667
- Okay.

749
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:20,900
-<i> I hope it's couture</i>

750
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,934
enough.

751
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,967
- [laughing]

752
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,500
- I need like wire cutters.

753
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,834
<i>This week's main challenge</i>

754
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:40,333
is making dumpster
red carpet couture.

755
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,133
- Where's some pins,
straight pins?

756
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,467
- I don't know.

757
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,233
-<i> The workroom's really tense</i>
<i>at the moment,</i>

758
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:48,633
'cause everyone's designing
their first runway look.

759
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:52,166
And it's important to make
a first impression.

760
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,333
- Everyone's all quiet.

761
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,834
That means you guys are
stressed.

762
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,633
-<i> Being an artist,</i>

763
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,533
I feel like the best thing
to do is just, you know,

764
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,867
concentrate on your concept,

765
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:02,233
chew as much as you can chew,

766
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:05,700
and you hope that whatever
you spit out comes out right.

767
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,367
-<i> Serena's going very slow.</i>

768
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,767
<i>She's doing this and that,</i>

769
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,767
<i>but there's just kind of</i>
<i>no product being made.</i>

770
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,100
And time's ticking down.

771
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,767
- Hello, hello, hello!

772
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,567
all: Hi!

773
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:21,133
- Now, is this the real
drag queens of Beverly Hills?

774
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,600
all: Yes!

775
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,934
- Yes, ma'am.

776
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,700
- Well, hello, Coco Montrese.

777
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
- Hi, Ru.

778
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,200
- Now, this outfit...

779
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,700
- I want to give
Debbie Reynolds...

780
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Marilyn Monroe
meets Madonna.

781
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,767
I just wanted to keep it
kind of classy.

782
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,100
- Yeah.

783
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,633
Well, there's a lot of
influences there.

784
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,066
-<i> I don't wanna play it safe.</i>

785
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,300
<i>One way or another,</i>

786
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,867
I need to stand out.

787
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,333
<i>So take it or leave it,</i>

788
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,500
<i>this is me tomorrow,</i>

789
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,767
and I'm gonna turn it.

790
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:51,767
- I know that you have a history
with Alyssa.

791
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:55,066
Has it gotten in the way so far
in the competition?

792
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,100
- It...kinda threw me.

793
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,667
<i>This Alyssa situation</i>

794
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,567
is a distraction for me
right now.

795
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,367
<i>And I need to put it aside</i>
<i>and focus on</i>

796
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,967
what Coco's gonna present.

797
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,367
- All right, Coco.
- Thank you.

798
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:09,266
- You're taking a risk,
and I love it, so go for it.

799
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,533
- Thanks, Ru.

800
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,266
- Serena ChaCha.

801
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:14,266
- Hi, Ru.

802
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:15,700
- How long have you been
doing drag?

803
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,834
- For three years.

804
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,867
Just turned 21,
just graduated art school.

805
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,166
I do performance art.

806
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,867
- Performance art.
- Yeah.

807
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:22,900
- Now, do you sew?

808
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,967
- Yes, but there is
a new art movement

809
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,734
called soft sculpture.

810
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,066
It's more about creating

811
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,767
a sculpture
rather than just tailoring.

812
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,266
- Well, that sounds great
on paper,

813
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,934
but what does it look like?

814
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,200
- It looks like this.

815
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,667
- That scares me.

816
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,266
- I'm trying to do detail
first,

817
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,400
just like when you paint.

818
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,066
- There's not a lot of time
here, you know.

819
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,333
- A little scared about that.

820
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,834
- And there's not a lot of dress
over here either.

821
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,100
- No, it's still really abstract
right now,

822
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,467
but I know it's gonna
come together.

823
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:48,066
-<i> Serena said she went</i>
<i>to art school.</i>

824
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,700
She might want her money back.

825
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,800
- I'm just surprised that
you're so calm and collected,

826
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,967
you know?

827
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:57,000
There's a lot of experienced
queens here

828
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,467
who are a little further along
in their execution

829
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,233
of their couture outfit.

830
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,867
-<i> All I have to do is come up</i>
<i>with a whole</i>

831
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:05,900
performative aspect for my
dress, and I'm totally calm.

832
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,066
I know this is gonna work out.
I totally do.

833
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,967
- Well, listen, I know you got
a lot of work to do here.

834
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,300
I can tell.
- I do.

835
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,133
- So get back to it.
- Okay, I will.

836
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,500
Thank you, Ru, I appreciate it.

837
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,867
- All right.

838
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,467
Roxxxy Andrews!

839
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,900
- RuPaul!

840
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,166
- Look at you, girl!

841
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,300
- Girl, I'm rushing.

842
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,734
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.

843
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:25,133
You know, losing weight
when I was a kid,

844
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,533
you know, I had to take
a lot of my clothes in

845
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,066
'cause we didn't have
a lot of money.

846
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,700
- Now, have you recently lost
a lot of weight?

847
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,333
- I did lose.
I've lost like 70 pounds.

848
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,900
- 70 pounds?
- 70 pounds.

849
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,066
- And how has that affected
the way you dress

850
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,633
and the way you feel?

851
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,834
- Well, girl, now I show
a little more body

852
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:39,066
than I used to be able to.

853
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,100
I used to be in eight corsets,

854
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,867
ten girdles and not being able
to breathe.

855
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,567
I used to be a big-ger girl.

856
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,066
<i>But I still consider myself</i>
<i>a girl</i>

857
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:48,333
<i>who's got a little meat</i>
<i>on her bones.</i>

858
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,266
And whether you're juicy, fat,
whatever,

859
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:52,333
embrace what you got
and work with it.

860
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,467
- You're not a big girl.
You're a thick girl.

861
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,600
- I'm a thick--I'm juicy.
- Oh, okay!

862
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,433
All right, I'm down with that.
- Right?

863
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,867
- Listen, I'm gonna let you get
back to work here.

864
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:03,867
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you.

865
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,200
Penny Tration!

866
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,500
- RuPaul!

867
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,767
- Hi!
You are our fan favorite.

868
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,767
The fans chose you.

869
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,600
- I know.
Which is amazing to me.

870
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,934
I now have a true respect
for politicians.

871
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,333
All the begging and the pleading
and the votes.

872
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,100
- So tell me what you're doing.

873
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,066
The silhouette has sort of
a drop waist.

874
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,567
- Yes, what I have
is this crazy torso,

875
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,400
so what I try and do
is elongate it a bit,

876
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,233
bring it down to my knees,
and then--

877
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,233
- You bring your torso down
to your knees?

878
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,266
- Well, ish.

879
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,734
Make the length come down here.

880
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,834
- Uh-huh.

881
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,767
Well, you know, you were very
enterprising

882
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,767
in your campaigning
to get here,

883
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,800
so you've gotta be able
to translate that

884
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
into your couture outfit.

885
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,367
- Yes.

886
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,533
<i>I am going for</i>

887
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:46,533
a look that is more classic.

888
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,900
<i>Penny Tration is not Lady Gaga</i>

889
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,400
and nor does she wanna be.

890
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,467

898

- How many times have you
auditioned for this show?

899

- Um, every time that
you're allowed to

900
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,967
and sometimes when you're not
even accepting applications.

901
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:13,667
- Well, you've worked so hard
to get here for so many years,

902
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,767
and then I was a little bit
surprised that, in the tank,

903
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:20,233
you sort of kind of gave up.

904
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:21,667
I just want to encourage you

905
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,500

every single time.

906
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,133
Now, tell me, what are you
working on?

907
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,066
- This is my plastic
evening gown.

908

- Uh-huh.

909

- I didn't wanna shy away
from making it look

910
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,467

of a dumpster.

911

Are you guys competitive

- Go on, don't lie.

You can tell the truth.
- We have so many questions.

979

- I would have been.
- Is it difficult?

980
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:27,834
- I mean, we--we have fights,

981
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:30,066
'cause it's two giant egos

982
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,633

- And isn't Sharon the superstar
of the relationship now?

984

It was very hard.

- Like when she was gone
or like before she even left?

- Before she left, while she
was gone, after she got back.

- Yeah, that's really classy.

999
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,667

Am I gonna be bitter

1000
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,066
or become her biggest fan?

1001
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,266
And I made the right choice.

1065
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,567
- Easy!

1066
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,633
- Girl, you ain't that pretty.

1067
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,967
Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.

1068
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,834
- Go home, Jade.

1069
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,900
Go home.
Just go home.

1070
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,166
Well, girls, we will see.

1071
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,200
- We shall see.

1072
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,400
- [laughing]

1073
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:55,600
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

1074
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,967
From Jersey to L.A.,

1075
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:01,667
it's my bi-coastal buddy
Michelle Visage.

1076
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,967
- Can you believe
it's season five?

1077
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,734
- Wow!
- Gorgeous.

1078
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:09,233
- And my favorite leading man,
Santino Rice.

1079
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:10,700
- You've come a long way, baby.

1080
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,433
- Welcome, darling.

1081
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:15,533
And fab photographer Mike Ruiz.

1082
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,166
- What's up?

1083
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,667
- And the very glamorous
Camille Grammer is here!

1084
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,300
- Hello, Ru.

1085
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,700
- Now, I hear they're letting
drag queens shop

1086
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,033
in Beverly Hills.

1087
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,367
- Oh, Ru, we've been doing that
for years.

1088
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,734
[laughter]

1089
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:34,867
- This week, it's a classic tale
of drags to riches

1090
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:38,967
as we challenged our queens
to turn Beverly Hills trash

1091
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,033
into Tinseltown class.

1092
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,033
Now they're ready to make

1093
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:46,567
their RuPaullywood
red carpet debut.

1094
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:48,867
Gentlemen, start your engines,

1095
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:52,066
and may the best woman win.

1096
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,300
-<i> Coming up...</i>

1097
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,467
- The shape is all wrong
for you.

1098
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:56,000
You're gonna get lost in it.

1099
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,600
- It was makeup for me.
It was just awful.

1100
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,066
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.

1101
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:04,133
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?

1102
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:07,166
- [laughing]

1103
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:13,066
- Commence shake...down.

1104
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:16,633
First up, the queen on
everyone's lips--

1105
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,934
Roxxxy Andrews.

1106
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,266
Foxy Roxxxy.

1107
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:21,667
- Ooh,
and the hips don't lie.

1108
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,767
- Aww...

1109
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,567
-<i> I'm walking down the runway,</i>

1110
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>giving them a little bit of hip</i>
<i>and body--bam!</i>

1111
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,166
<i>This is exactly what I would</i>
<i>wear to an awards show.</i>

1112
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,200
- All that ass.

1113
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,867
- Like to spend a night
in the Roxxxy.

1114
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,233
- She has a huge opening...
weekend.

1115
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,166
And her box office
ain't bad either.

1116
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,800
[laughter]

1117
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,500
Jinkx Monsoon.

1118
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,867
- I'm ready for my close-up,

1119
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,300
Mr. Demille.

1120
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,133
-<i> I'm serving 100% aquamarine</i>

1123
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:56,300
- I dream of Jinkx.

1124
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,066
- Loofah, my ass!

1125
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,333
[laughter]

1126
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,467
Detox on the red carpet.

1127
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,900
Oh, it's severe up in here.

1128
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,300
- Well, now we know where
last season's backdrop went.

1129
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,467
- Yes!

1130
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,333
-<i> I'm serving</i>
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i>

1131
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,600

1132
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,433
<i>and I feel really sexy</i>
<i>and gorgeous.</i>

1133
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,900
- Just another day in Hollywood.

1134
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,767
She's detoxing from crack,
by the way.

1135
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:22,066
[laughter]

1136
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:24,834

1137
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,700
The ladyboy in red.

1138
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,767
-<i> I feel really amazing</i>

1139
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,066

<i>the garment</i>

1140

<i>is completely hand-stitched,</i>

1141
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,133
<i>and it's Hollywood</i>
<i>red carpet couture.</i>

1142
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:37,066
- Isn't she giving Jean Kasem
and...

1143
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:38,166

1144
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,600
- Janice Dickinson.

1145
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,600
- Let's have lunch at the Ivy.

1146
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,400
For your consideration,
Honey Mahogany.

<i>and I'm stomping my heart out</i>
<i>down the runway.</i>

1150
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:54,066
- The men love me,
the women love me.

1151
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:55,834
[laughter]

1152
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:59,533
- You can catch more flies with
Honey Mahogany.

1153
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,900
Jade Jolie.

1154
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,333
- I can see her
peacock-cock-cock.

1155
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,734

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,066
<i>I am a million bucks,</i>

1160

Wow.

1164
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,333
- She's all about the drama.

1165
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,900
- It's very drama-filled.

1166
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,100
- The bird flew the coop
on this one.

1167
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,600
- Yes.

1168
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,934

1170
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:36,633
<i>and my mind is in it</i>
<i>to win it.</i>

1171
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,066
- Somebody took the Black Swan

1172
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:39,367
and mated with the matador.

1173
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,433
- And now we've got bird flu.
- Yes.

1174
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,900

- [laughs]
Yes, please.

1176
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,200
- Penny for your thoughts.

1177
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
-<i> I'm walking slow and letting</i>

1178
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,233
<i>them take</i>
<i>all the Penny Tration in.</i>

1179
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,667
<i>And I make sure</i>
<i>they can get to see</i>

1180
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,467
<i>the backside of Penny Tration.</i>

1181
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,834
- You better sissy that walk,
girl.

1182
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:56,934
- All right!

1183
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,767
- You better sissy that walk.
- Hey!

1184
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,400
- I wonder if she has a twin.

1185
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,867
She'd be double Penny Tration.

1186
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,867
[laughter]

1187
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:05,667
- Coco Montrese.

1188
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,066

1189
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:08,900
- She is ready for her close-up.

1190
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,567
- Somebody blow into those
bullhorns.

1191
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,066
- I know.

1192
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,800
-<i> I'm booking it down</i>
<i>the runway,</i>

1193
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,967
<i>giving it to you.</i>

1194
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:17,900
<i>I am serving you</i>
<i>old Hollywood.</i>

00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,567
<i>White woman fish, baby!</i>

1196
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:21,934
- Now, she's a drag queen,

1197
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:23,934
but she really wants to direct.

1198
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,767
- Don't we all?

1199
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:28,266
You, on top.

1200
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,100
- Vivienne Pinay.

1201
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
- Oh!
- Oooh!

1202
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,467
- Cache spokeswoman.

1203
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,767
- Uh-huh.

1204
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:37,533
-<i> I'm giving face,</i>
<i>and I'm giving body.</i>

1205
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:38,834
<i>Hands down, I am the fishiest</i>

1206
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,500
<i>bitch in this competition.</i>

1207

- Very J.Lo.

1208
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,333
- Mwah!
Box office gold.

1209
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:47,600
She's ready
for the casting couch.

1210
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,233
The 49th state--Alaska.

1211
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,700
all: Oh!

1212
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,834
- That's gorgeous.

1213
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:55,800
- Is that a Birkin bag
or a Glad bag?

1214
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,066
[laughter]

1215
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,233
-<i> So that dress is made of</i>
<i>plastic,</i>

1216
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,633
<i>but I am treating it</i>

1217
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:03,367
<i>like the most expensive</i>
<i>couture gown ever.</i>

1218
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,800
<i>And I just wiggle my way down</i>

1219
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,967
<i>the runway as best I can.</i>

1220
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:10,467
- She must have
a really big dog.

1221
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,166
[laughter]

1222
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,433
Alaska.

1223
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:16,300
Oh, dear, I can see Russia
from here.

1224
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,266
- Is that Sarah Palin
in that dress?

1225
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:19,700
- It's Saran Palin.

1226
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,700
[laughter]

1227
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,133
Lineysha Sparx.

1228
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:24,767
- Ooh, glamour.

1229
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,200
- Balenciaga!

1230
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,700
- Yes.
- She's really working it.

1231
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,967
- That's how she walks
to the grocery store.

1232
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:31,333
What are you talking about?

1233
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:34,967
-<i> My dress is full extravaganza,</i>

1234
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:37,233
<i>and my design is flawless.</i>

1235
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,367
- And she's got a shoe
on her head.

1236
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,066
- Oh, yeah!

1237
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,767
- She has a foot up
on the others.

1238
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:44,467
- She does, she's pumped up
the volume,

1239
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,667
I'll tell you that.

1240
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:48,066
She's got Lisa Vanderpump
on her mind.

1241
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:50,066
[laughter]

1242
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:52,367
Monica Beverly Hillz.

1243
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:53,800
- Ooh! Look at those legs.

1244
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,700
Legs forever!

1245
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,233
-<i> I'm feeling extra,</i>
<i>extra fishy.</i>

1246
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,166
<i>My legs are bronzed</i>
<i>for the gods,</i>

1247
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,767
<i>and I'm just eating it all up.</i>

1248
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:04,266
- She is serving Lady Miss Kier
in the face--you see that?

1249
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:06,433
- Yes, she is, meets Lil Kim.

1250
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,967
- Lady Miss Kim.

1251
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,800
Serena ChaCha!

1252
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,834
- Hey!

1253
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,133
- From Panama!

1254
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:14,300
- Panama City, Florida?

1255
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,800
- Panama City, Florida...

1256
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,166
- Via the Suez Canal.

1257
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,233
- Yes.

1258
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,400
[laughter]

1259
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,967
-<i> Serena ChaCha</i>
<i>is a drag scholar.</i>

1260
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,100
<i>I feel avant-garde, couture,</i>

1261
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,066
<i>editorial, like some sort of</i>
<i>surreal painting.</i>

1262
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,467
<i>I'm giving them something</i>
<i>different.</i>

1263
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:30,066
- It's like Shakira meets...

1264
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:31,433
- Pinocchio?

1265
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,200
- Who you calling a lederhosen?

1266
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,633
[laughter]

1267
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:36,600
- Cha cha cha!

1268
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,567
Welcome, ladies.

1269
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,867
Based on your Hollywood splash
photo session

1270
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:48,967
and your red carpet
couture presentation,

1271
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:52,100
I've made some decisions.

1272
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,200
When I call your name, please
step forward.

1273
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,700
Jinkx Monsoon.

1274
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,667
Detox.

1275
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,200
Honey Mahogany.

1276
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,100
Monica Beverly Hillz.

1277
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,700
Vivienne Pinay.

1278
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,066
Alyssa Edwards.

1279
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,066
Coco Montrese.

1280
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:23,266
To be America's next
drag superstar,

1281
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:24,834
you need to snatch

1282
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:28,433
the world's attention
at every turn.

1283
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:32,433
And unfortunately tonight...

1284
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
you are...

1285
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,166
the S word.

1286
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,233
Safe.

1287
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,800
- I didn't come to this
competition just to be safe.

1288
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,767
<i>I am here to show people</i>
<i>I still got it.</i>

1289
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:50,600
- Anyone who says it's an honor
just to be nominated...

1290
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,467
is one lying bitch.

1291
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,834
You may leave the stage.

1292
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,266
Oh, ladies...

1293
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:02,767
one more thing.

1294
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,066
Don't call us.

1295
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:08,300
We'll call you.

1296
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,900
That's all.

1297
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,300
<i>Coming up...</i>

1298
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,066
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you

1299
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:21,934
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.

1300
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:24,066
- What's exposed just looks
like boy.

1301
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:26,066
It was all a mess.

1302
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:27,767
- The time has come...

1303
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:30,934
for you to lip sync...

1304
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:33,400
for your life.

1305
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,767
[laughing]

1306
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:45,100
Ladies, you represent the best
and the worst of the week.

1307
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,734
It's time for the judges'
critiques.

1308
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:50,066
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.

1309
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,066
- Out of all the dresses,
this is the one

1310
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,533
that I would be wearing.

1311
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:56,066
Absolutely gorgeous.

1312
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,300
- Everything you've done
was just perfect to your curves,

1313
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,734
and you revealed enough skin
to keep it classy.

1314
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,333
Look at that!

1315
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,133
- You just wanna show your ass.

1316
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,200
- [laughs]

1317
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,600
- I don't know
if you guys noticed,

1318
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,367
but when I showed you my shoes,
they're RuPaul shoes.

1319
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,500
- I noticed.

1320
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,400
- And I found them
in the dumpster.

1321
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,867
- What?
- What?

1322
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:16,233
- Who would throw those away?

1323
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,233
- I don't know.

1324
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,600
- Thank you, Roxxxy.

1325
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,867
Next up, Ivy Winters!

1326
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,200
- Ivy.
Ooh!

1327
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,567
- This dress is absolutely
gorgeous.

1328
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:25,667
You sewed this whole thing?

1329
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:28,066
- I did. I hand-stitched it
completely.

1330
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,133
- I was looking at you

1331
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,700
and I'm like,
where's the trash?

1332
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,066
You kinda have to bring in
some kind of

1333
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:37,467
unconventional material
into this challenge.

1334
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:39,200
- Thank you, Ivy Winters.

1335
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,333
Next up, Jade Jolie.

1336
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,600
- Hey, Ru, hey!

1337
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,667
- You have the sweetest,
softest voice.

1338
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,734
- [deep voice] You've never
said that to me, Mike.

1339
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,367
[laughter]

1340
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,367
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you

1341
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:53,100
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.

1342
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,166
There's too many details all
crying out for my attention.

1343
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,767
- This is very much my
personality,

1344
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:01,400
kinda like taste
the crazy rainbow kinda girl.

1345
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,834
- What does the rainbow
taste like?

1346
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:03,967
- Butterflies and unicorns?

1347
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,734
- Yeah. Lisa Frank,
all that good stuff.

1348
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:06,900
- Oh, I love it!

1349
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,000
You are just a cute little
thing, aren't you?

1350
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,133
- You're a cute little thing.

1351
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,600
- I could eat you up
in one bite. Argg!

1352
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,033
- All right, thank you, Jade.

1353
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,400
Next up, Penny Tration.

1354
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,300
What do you got to say for
yourself?

1355
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,333
- I'm so glad to be here.

1356
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,467
There's a lot to see.

1357
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:22,333
Take a look.

1358
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,967
- I think with the dress,

1359
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:26,767
it starts to fall apart
after the bust line.

1360
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:29,433
The left and the right look like
different shapes.

1361
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:31,633
- I just think if you took this
front slit

1362
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:34,200
and made it into a side slit,
I think it would have

1363
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,533
been just more flattering.

1364
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:41,900
- One thing I notice is,
your shading is very dark.

1365
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,600
Black, dare I say.

1366
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,100
- The black on the side looks
like a sideburn almost.

1367
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,667
- Next up, Alaska.

1368
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

1369
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:55,100
Now, did you have any difficulty
putting this outfit together?

1370
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,467
- Getting it on my body.

1371
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,033
I don't have a zipper.

1372
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:00,200
You can't really sew into
plastic.

1373
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
- You know, the thing is,
you can take something

1374
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,433
that costs nothing
and turn it into something

1375
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:06,066
that looks like
a million dollars.

1376
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,266
And you did it tonight.

1377
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:08,433
- Thank you.

1378
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:09,500
- Why no earrings?

1379
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,633
- I lost them in the dumpster.

1380
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,567
[laughter]

1381
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:15,133
- I like the way you have
accessorized it.

1382
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,066
I don't think you need
anything more,

1383
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,867
'cause you've got
a lot of shimmer going on

1384
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,567
because of the plastic
Saran Wrap.

1385
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:21,900
- Thank you.

1386
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,834
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.

1387
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,066
- Puerto Rico in the house.

1388
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,066
-<i> Que bella.</i>

1389
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:30,200
This is really elegant.

1390
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,467
What is that?

1391
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:32,567
- It's wallpaper, actually.

1392
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:33,567
- Is it really?
- Yes.

1393
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:34,600
- It's brilliant.

1394
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,934
- I mean, really impressed

1395
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,433
because that is not an easy

1396
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,667
thing to work with.

1397
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:41,367
And you made it look
really couture.

1398
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:43,533
- I love the shoe as well
in your hair.

1399
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,834
- Yes.
- Repurposed.

1400
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,367
- That's really using
your head.

1401
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:47,633
[laughter]

1402
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:51,066
- I love the way you've created
this piece.

1403
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,266
- This is because if I need to
do the lip synch,

1404
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,266
I can do it like this.

1405
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,266
[singing gibberish]

1406
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:58,066
[laughter]

1407
00:51:58,066 --> 00:51:59,667
- Thank you, Lineysha.

1408
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:01,567
Serena ChaCha.

1409
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:02,633
-<i> Hola.</i>

1410
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:03,900
- I had a little bit
of an issue

1411
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,834
with what you're wearing;
I'm not gonna lie.

1412
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:06,934
The shape is all wrong for you.

1413
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:08,767
You're gonna get lost in it.

1414
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,934
And then what's exposed
just looks like boy.

1415
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:13,834
- It looks like you've done
your makeup

1416
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:15,667
in a lighter shade
than your body.

1417
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:18,066
And it almost looks like
if you pulled the head

1418
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:20,633
off of one doll
and put it onto the body of,

1419
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:22,567
like, a G.I. Joe figure.

1420
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:26,066
And this collar really adds this
big weight

1421
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:29,767
around your neck that separates
your head from your body.

1422
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:33,567
- Can I see it without
the neck thing?

1423
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,333
- It looks so much prettier.

1424
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,767
- I wanna say that I'm open for
all the criticism.

1425
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,066
And I'm making sure to put it
toward the next challenge,

1426
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:41,767
whatever that may be.

1427
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,734
- All right.
Well, thank you.

1428
00:52:43,734 --> 00:52:46,066
Well, ladies, I think we've
heard enough.

1429
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:49,066
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

1430
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,233
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,

1431
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:53,700
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1432
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,467
You may leave the stage.

1433
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:57,934
All right, kids.

1434
00:52:57,934 --> 00:53:01,066
Just between us "goils"...

1435
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:03,867
let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.

1436
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:07,767
- Roxxxy had a very convincing
couture red carpet look

1437
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:12,867
and a great blend of fabrics
and unconventional materials.

1438
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:15,233
- She combined goth with glam.

1439
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,367
And I thought she looked great.

1440
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:18,734
- Completely thought-out.

1441
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,967
Like she knows what her shape
is all about.

1442
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:24,867
- I do have a con
with Roxxxy Andrews.

1443
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:27,533
I wanted to see more ass.

1444
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:29,233
- [laughs]

1445
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:31,500
- Ivy Winters.

1446
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,066
- I mean, the dress
was beautiful.

1447
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,367
But I really couldn't stop
looking at her hair

1448
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:36,533
because I just didn't like it,

1449
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:38,433
'cause this gown was
so "elegwent"--

1450
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:39,433
"eloguent."

1451
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:40,800
- You real "eloguent."

1452
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,266
- That's my new word.
- You speak "eloguent."

1453
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,066
- "Eloguent."
- Talk about couture.

1454
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:45,567
I mean, she hand-stitched
that dress.

1455
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,300
- As beautiful as the dress was,
where's the trash?

1456
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,400
I didn't get that same kind of
feeling that I get

1457
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,633
when I look at Alaska
or Lineysha.

1458
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:54,967
- Lineysha's "eloguent."

1459
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,266
- [laughs]

1460
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,633
All right, let's move on to
Jade Jolie.

1461
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:02,467
My goodness, Jade Jolie.
She had a lot on.

1462
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:05,967
- I can't really tell where
her taste level is because--

1463
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:07,767
- I think you can.
I think you can.

1464
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:10,767
- She has a very fantastical
sort of outlook on life

1465
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,667
about rainbows and unicorns
and all.

1466
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,734
But I just don't think
it was very well executed.

1467
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:19,266
- Let's talk about
Penny Tration.

1468
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:20,934
- She came out
with a great attitude.

1469
00:54:20,934 --> 00:54:22,200
I get the whole Mae West kinda,

1470
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,900
"Come up and see me sometime"
thing going on.

1471
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,066
But then you kinda scroll down
a little bit.

1472
00:54:28,066 --> 00:54:29,166
- The padding was asymmetrical.

1473
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,900
It looked like she had
a tilted pelvis.

1474
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,400
Somebody call the osteopath
or something.

1475
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,600
- [laughs]

1476
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,233
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.

1477
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,533
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?

1478
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:40,066
- It is not.
You could be a big girl,

1479
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,133
make those proportions
work for you

1480
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:45,300
and actually look couture,
and she didn't.

1481
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,834
- Yeah, but it was the makeup
for me.

1482
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:47,934
It was just awful.

1483
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:49,667
- That was probably
the best part, Camille.

1484
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,800
[laughter]

1485
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,166
- All right, let's head on

1486
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,567
to the 49th state,
Alaska.

1487
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:57,600
- I wasn't really expecting much
from Alaska

1488
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,767
based on her performance
in the photo shoot.

1489
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:02,367
But a little Saran Wrap
went a long way tonight.

1490
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,066
The only thing is, it should've
had a little slit

1491
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:05,967
'cause she had some difficulty
walking in it.

1492
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:08,533
- My one thing was,
I would've loved to have seen

1493
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,066
sparkly earrings up on that.

1494
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:12,800
- Well, Michelle,
Alaska's not from New Jersey.

1495
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,400
- [laughs]

1496
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,600
- All right, let's move on
to Lineysha Sparx.

1497
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,767
- What a gorgeous face
on this one.

1498
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:20,900
- Yes.

1499
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,367
- The gown was absolutely
gorgeous.

1500
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,900
And when we found out that
it was wallpaper,

1501
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,367
I was even more impressed.

1502
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:28,333
- And to put a shoe, a pump,
in her hair,

1503
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,200
I thought that was really fun
and whimsical.

1504
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,400
- You're right.

1505
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,767
And it could've very easily been
a disaster.

1506
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:36,300
- But all in all, she's what
we call a TP.

1507
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,066
- A total package,
that's right.

1508
00:55:38,066 --> 00:55:43,800
Let's talk ChaCha,
as in Serena ChaCha.

1509
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,834
- Oh, God.

1510
00:55:44,834 --> 00:55:47,533
She literally
was drag Pinocchio.

1511
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:49,133
It was lederhosen.

1512
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:51,367
It was really like I was waiting
for yodeling.

1513
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:53,734
It was all just a mess.

1514
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:54,867
- She was showing so much of

1515
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:56,867
this kind of, like,
oiled up chest.

1516
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,633
- And it was like a little boy
with a costume on.

1517
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:01,300
- I think that
she has to start thinking

1518
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,533
about her tiny, little body
and the way she's gonna

1519
00:56:04,533 --> 00:56:06,333
execute her fashions.

1520
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,667
- Well, she executed this
fashion.

1521
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:10,066
[laughter]

1522
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,266
- She sure did.

1523
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:13,066
- Silence!

1524
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,233
I've made my decision.

1525
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:20,066
Bring back my girls.

1526
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:24,066
[laughing]

1527
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,133
Welcome back, ladies.

1528
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:32,266
I've made some decisions.

1529
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:35,734
Ivy Winters, your red gown

1530
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,734
looked like it was ripped from

1531
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:40,900
the pages of<i> Vogue.</i>

1532
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,767
You're safe.

1533
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,233
Alaska,

1534
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:52,467
you had this challenge
in the bag.

1535
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:53,800
You're safe.

1536
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,867
- Thank you.

1537
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,266
- Roxxxy Andrews,
you dove deep

1538
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:07,066
into the dumpsters
of Beverly Hills

1539
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:12,166
and made rubbish
look ravishing.

1540
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:13,500
Condragulations.

1541
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,200
You're the winner
of this challenge.

1542
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,667
[applause]

1543
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:21,467
You receive a custom gown
by Marco Marco,

1544
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:25,066
plus immunity from elimination
next week.

1545
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,066
-<i> Are you kidding me right now?</i>

1546
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,400
<i>I'm on cloud nine.</i>

1547
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,433
Suck that--aah!

1548
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:32,567
Thank you
for believing in me.

1549
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:34,934
- You may join the other girls.

1550
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:43,734
Lineysha Sparx,
you lit up the runway

1551
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:47,266
in classic Hollywood glamour.

1552
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:49,200
You're safe.

1553
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,834
-<i> I thought that</i>

1554
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,100
I was gonna win.

1555
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,100
<i>But whatever.</i>

1556
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,433
- Serena ChaCha,
on the runway

1557
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:03,233
you moved like Jagger,
but your red carpet look

1558
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:06,433
was "coutorture."

1559
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:10,633
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1560
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:12,333
-<i> Oh, crap.</i>

1561
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,200
You really messed up.

1562
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,500
<i>I do not wanna be the first</i>
<i>person sent home.</i>

1563
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,100
This cannot fucking happen
at this point.

1564
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,934
- Penny Tration, we love your
dangerous curves.

1565
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,166
But your red carpet couture

1566
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:32,066
veered off in the wrong
direction.

1567
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:35,066
Jade Jolie, you didn't wear
your dress.

1568
00:58:35,066 --> 00:58:37,133
It wore you.

1569
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:41,767
But still, your personality
shined through.

1570
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:45,233
Jade Jolie...

1571
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:46,367
you're safe.

1572
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:47,400
- [exhales]

1573
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,100
Thank you guys so much.

1574
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,333
- Wait.
Hold up, mama.

1575
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,433
May I give you a word of advice?

1576
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:57,066
- Yes.
- Edit.

1577
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,934
- Edit?
- That's right.

1578
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:00,834
- Thank you so much.

1579
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:05,600
- Penny Tration, I'm sorry,

1580
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,533
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.

1581
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:09,700
- [deep breath]

1582
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,500
<i>I'm disappointed</i>
<i>because there are</i>

1583
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,400
a lot of people who really
wanted me to be here.

1584
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,767
<i>And I'm letting them down.</i>

1585

Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

I don't think there's much else
I would've done differently.

1655
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,133

1657
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:20,300
And my family's

how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1662
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,266
Can I get a "amen" up in here?

1664
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:40,533
- All right,
now let the music play.

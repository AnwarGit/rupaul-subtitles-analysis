- TRINITY KARDASHIAN.

179
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,834
- THAT, OF COURSE, MEANS
VIVACIOUS GOES TO TEAM ADORE.

180
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,900
- COME, DARLING, COME.
- OH, YEAH.

181
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,166
- VERY INTERESTING.

182
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,100
YOU CHOSE THE QUEENS
FROM YOUR ORIGINAL GROUPS.

183
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,467
- OF COURSE I CHOSE MY GROUP.

184
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,867
THEY'RE THE BEE'S KNEES.

185
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,433
THAT FIRST GROUP
HAS SOME PRETTY BITCHES,

186
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,266
BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM.

187
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,900
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,

188
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:09,667

OH, I LOVE THIS.

197
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,734
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF EIGHTIES HORROR MOVIES.

198
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:34,934
SO, AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT

199
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,867
THAT IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
VERSION, I WAS FREAKING OUT.

200
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,667
OKAY, I'M HEATHER,
YOU'RE BECKY.

201
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,600
- OKAY.

202
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,166
- YOU'RE THE CRAZY MOTHER.
- YES.

- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]

AT THIS POINT,
WE HAVE LIMITED TIME.

206
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
I'VE JUST GOT TO HAND
THIS SHIT OUT

207
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,667
LIKE IT WAS CANDY
OUT OF A PINATA.

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,033
CATCH IT, BITCH,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE ROLE.

209
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,533
HOLD ON, WHERE AM I?

210
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,166
- PLEASE, DON'T LET ME BE BUTCH.

211
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
- AND THEN YOU'D BE
THE BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,333
- YOU COULD DO THAT, NO?

213
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,600
- YEAH.

00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:10,233
"STOP! WHAT THE HELL?
I'M A WORKING LADY."

215
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,367
- THERE IS NOTHING MANLY
ON APRIL,

216
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,667
SO SHE'S GOT
SOME STRETCHING TO DO.

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
- SASHAY AWAY.

- EW, GAG ME WITH A...
"DALARIAN."

219
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,533
WHAT IS IT?
- A DELOREAN.

220

- IT'S, LIKE, AN EIGHTIES CAR.

I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DELOREAN.

223
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,367
FOR ALL I KNOW,
IT'S A FUCKING ANCIENT DILDO.

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,900
I HAVE NO IDEA.

225
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:42,433
- WELL, NOT MY FATHER...

226
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:45,767
BECAUSE...BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A FATHER.

227
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,133
- I'M A LITTLE WORRIED,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

- I THINK YOU WOULD BE
A GOOD MRS. BATES.

- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME,
I LIKE ALL OF THEM.

- OUR TEAM GETS
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL,"

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,900
THE ORIGINAL,
SET IN THE SIXTIES.

240
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,767
I'M EXCITED
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL

241
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,533
IS ALWAYS BETTER
THAN THE SEQUEL.

242
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,100
- I WAS THINKING MRS. HITCHCOCK
WITH A BRITISH ACCENT,

243
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,300
BECAUSE I'VE GOT AN ACCENT.

244

DARIENNE, SCARY HEAD IN A BOX?

- SURE.

247
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,166
NOBODY WANTS THIS
"HEAD IN A BOX" ROLE.

248
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,867
IT'S A SMALLER ROLE,
AND IT'S JUST A HEAD IN A BOX,

249
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,433
BUT I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT.

250
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,400

STICK WITH THESE CHARACTERS.

- ALL RIGHT.

256
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
- I REALIZE MY CHARACTER
HAS THE MOST LINES,

257
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,133
AND NOW I'M PISSED,

258
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,433
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
TO LEARN A LOT OF SHIT,

259
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,133
AND I AM NOT AN ACTOR.

- WELL, I THINK IT'D BE FUNNIER.

- THE BLACK GIRL IS PLAYING
GHETTO. HOW ORIGINAL.

268
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,033
- TRINITY SAID SHE WOULD LIKE
TO LEARN FROM EVERYONE,

269
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,400
AND SHE DOESN'T CONSIDER HERSELF
A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS.

BUT SHE'S LIKE
VERY, VERY DEFENSIVE.

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,467
SHE NEVER WANTS TO HEAR IT.

- GASP!

301
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,433
- JOSLYN IS TOTALLY SELLING IT.

00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,667
EVER SINCE THEY INVENTED
BIRTH CONTROL, YOU...

308
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,633
- CUT.

309
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,166
TRINITY, YOU HAVE
TO PLAY TO THE CAMERA,

310
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,600
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE YOU
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND.

- WE'RE GOING TO POP
YOUR CHERRY TONIGHT.

TRINITY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOUR BACK IS TURNED.

AND HAVE TO SHOW SOMEBODY
WHERE A CAMERA IS,

323
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,567

WHEN YOU PICK THAT BOX UP,

332
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,266
THERE NEEDS TO BE A REACTION.

333
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,000
THERE'S A HEAD ON A TABLE
WITH A SATANIC STAR ON IT.

00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,934
- GOT YOU.

335
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,433
- I MAY ACTUALLY
PASS OUT IN THIS BOX

00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,200
IF TRINITY CONTINUES TO FUCK UP.

337
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,467
I MAY END UP

692
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:11,667
- SHUT UP!
- [SCREAMS]

693
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,767
- MY BABY GIRL!

694
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,233
- CATCH!

695
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,066
- YOU'VE KILLED HER!

696
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,166
[SCREAMS]

697
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,266
- LET'S, LIKE,
GET OUT OF HERE ALREADY.

698
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,066
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

699
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
- PEEK-A-RU.
- WHAT THE HELL?

700
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,266
- THIS IS THE BEGINNING

701
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,800
OF THE REST OF YOUR AFTERLIFE.

702
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,333
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]

703
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:51,834
- WOW.

704
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,166
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT OUR TEAM

705
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,500
IS PROBABLY ON THE LOWER END
OF THE SCALE.

706
00:29:56,533 --> 00:30:00,667
- THAT WAS ELECTRIFYING.

707
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,000
- I FOUND IT A LITTLE FUNNY THAT
THEIRS WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE

708
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,300
AND OURS WAS IN COLOR.

709
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,066
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]

710
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,767
- NO.

711
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,567
- COMING UP...

712
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,233
- THE PERFORMANCE WAS FLAT.

713
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:24,000
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT.

714
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,400
- SILENCE!

715
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:26,533
[LAUGHING]

716
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,934
- [LAUGHING]

717
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,533
YOU GIRLS WERE A REAL SCREAM,

718
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:37,467
BUT ONE GROUP
WAS BLOODY FABULOUS.

719
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,800
TEAM...

720
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,266
MILK, CONDRAGULATIONS.

721
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,767
YOU ARE ALL SAFE
FROM ELIMINATION THIS WEEK.

722
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,433
TRINITY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

723
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:54,300
- I JUST, FOR A MOMENT, I REALLY
THOUGHT I PUT YOU GUYS DOWN,

724
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,033
AND I'M A VIRGIN ACTOR,

725
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:58,633
BUT THANK YOU
FOR SEEING THAT I TRIED.

726
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,400
- YOU HAD US SCARED AT FIRST,

727
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,967
BUT YOU TOOK DIRECTION,
AND IT SHOWS.

728
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,734
- THANK YOU.

729
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,834
- DARIENNE LAKE...

730
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,734
NOW, FOR GIVING YOUR TALKING
HEAD, BODY, AND SOUL,

731
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,734
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.

732
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,166
- WHAT?
[APPLAUSE]

733
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,367
- YOU'VE WON
A FIVE-NIGHT STAY FOR TWO

734
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,734
AT THE ISLAND HOUSE
KEY WEST FIVE-STAR RESORT.

735
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,700
TEAM MILK,
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.

736
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:30,934
TEAM ADORE, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.

737
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,600
LET'S START WITH APRIL CARRION.

738
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:34,567
- HELLO!

739
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,967
- I LOVE THE UMBRELLA,
LOVE THE COLOR,

740
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,100
AND I FIND YOU
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

741
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:45,066
- BUT THE PERFORMANCE
AS A BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT

742
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,166
WAS FLAT.

743
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,433
I DIDN'T REALLY GET BUTCH,
I GOT BOY.

744
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:53,867
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

745
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,967
- HELLO, MAMA RU.

746
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,533
- I LOVE YOUR FASCINATOR,
THE BUTTERFLY HAT.

747
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,900
IT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU.

748
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:01,333
- IN THE MOVIE, YOU DID OKAY.

749
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,700
- BUT YOU WERE CARRYING
APRIL THROUGH IT.

750
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:04,800
WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION,

751
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,133
YOU CAN'T RELY
ON THE OTHER PERSON

752
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,000
TO GIVE YOU THE ENERGY
TO KEEP YOU GOING.

753
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,734
YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
WITHIN YOURSELF.

754
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,667
- NEXT UP, GIA GUNN.

755
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,367
- I LIKED YOUR PERFORMANCE,
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

756
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,700
I THOUGHT YOU TOTALLY
CHANNELED VALLEY VIRGIN.

757
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:19,467
- WELL, IT'S FUNNY, GIA,
BECAUSE ON THE SET

758
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,467
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER
A LOT OF THE DIALOGUE,

759
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,800
AND IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU HAD A TECHNIQUE,

760
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,033
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

761
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:27,467
THAT THERE WAS
NO TECHNIQUE, RIGHT?

762
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,066
[LAUGHTER]

763
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,900
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.

764
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:34,000
- ARE YOU CINCHED?

765
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,934
- NO.
- YEAH.

766
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,066
- I HAVE A HOG BODY RIGHT NOW.

767
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,767
- SO, YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER.

768
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,400
- I WAS.

769
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,633
- AND HOW'D YOU ASSIGN
THE OTHER ROLES?

770
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,567
- LIKE THIS: YOU HAVE THAT,

771
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,633
YOU HAVE THAT,
AND YOU HAVE THAT.

772
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,934
- SO, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS,

773
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:53,500
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE
IS A GAME BEING PLAYED HERE.

774
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:57,333
- AND OF ALL THE GIRLS,
YOU WERE THE LEAST PREPARED.

775
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,500
MY GUESS IS THAT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE CHARISMATIC,

776
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:00,900
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAIL BY

777
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:03,200
WITHOUT HAVING
TO PUT THE WORK IN.

778
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:07,100
YOU OWE IT TO YOUR TALENT
TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

779
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:12,166
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
LIKE IF I, LIKE, LET YOU DOWN.

780
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,100
I'M CONSTANTLY PROVING MYSELF
WITHIN THE DRAG COMMUNITY,

781
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:18,433
AND I'M HERE TO PROVE TO YOU
AND TO EVERYBODY I'M A STAR.

782
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,734
- STARS PUT IN THE WORK.

783
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,266
ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME.

784
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,633
- YOU DELIVERED A VERY GOOD
PERFORMANCE IN THE MOVIE.

785
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,100
YOU HAD JUST
ONE OF THE BEST SCREAMS.

786
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,467
- THANK YOU, BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU SITTING

787
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
SO CLOSE TO MICHELLE'S EARRING.
[LAUGHTER]

788
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,967
- [BUZZES]

789
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,100
- NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.

790
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,600
- SEE, THIS TYPE OF LOOK
I DON'T HATE,

791
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,266
BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH IT,

792
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,000
AND SO DID RU.
- SURE.

793
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,734
- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DOING.

794
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:48,867
- RIGHT.
- WITH THAT SAID, THE ACTING,

795
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,333
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNSURE
OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,

796
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,400
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO KIND
OF GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT.

797
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:56,934
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT
REALLY EMBRACING FULLY.

798
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,066
- IN MY DEFENSE,

799
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,133
I HAVE NO THEATRICAL
BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER.

800
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,800
- LOOK AT YOURSELF.

801
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:06,033
WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING
IS THEATER!

802
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,233
- ARE YOU HOLDING YOUR HEADPIECE
BACK SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR?

803
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:09,600
- YES.

804
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,100
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING THAT
MARIAH CAREY THING, YOU KNOW,

805
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,033
WHERE SHE HOLDS
HER EAR LIKE THAT.

806
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:15,333
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

807
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,400
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

808
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,367
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,

809
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,667
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

810
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,567
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
JUST BETWEEN US SHE-DEVILS,

811
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,567
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

812
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,133
STARTING WITH APRIL CARRION.

813
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,400
- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN
A LITTLE BETTER WORK

814
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:32,600
IN THE FILM.

815
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:35,400
- YEAH, I THINK THAT APRIL
WAS MISCAST IN THIS ROLE.

816
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,500
- ADORE WAS THE TEAM LEADER,
AND SO, THEREFORE,

817
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,000
SHOULD SHE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HANDING OUT THE JOBS?

818
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,166
- THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

819
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,967
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON
TO LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

820
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,266
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER I LOVE.

821
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,367
I THINK SHE'S
INCREDIBLY CHARMING.

822
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,133
THE ACTING WAS...

823
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,300
- SHE DIDN'T SUCK.
- I'M SAYING SHE DIDN'T SUCK.

824
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,500
- I THINK IT WAS PARTLY
BECAUSE HER SCREEN PARTNER

825
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,900
WAS APRIL CARRION

826
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,900
EVEN TONGUE KISSING
COULDN'T SAVE IT.

827
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,767
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
GIA GUNN.

828
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,000
- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE IT WAS HER BEST DRAG.

829
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,166
AS FAR AS HER PERFORMANCE,
IT WAS FLAT.

830
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,667
- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW FAMILIAR
SOME OF THEM ARE WITH ACTING.

831
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,834
AGE DOES HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BIT WITH IT.

832
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,066
- BUT YOU WERE NOMINATED
FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD

833
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,233
WHEN YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD.

834
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,433
- YES, BUT I'D BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 6.

835
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:20,033
[LAUGHTER]

836
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,033
- LET'S GO TO ADORE DELANO.

837
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:23,667
- WELL, I ADORE ADORE.

838
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,500
SHE'S KIND OF LIKE
A DAUGHTER I WANT TO SLAP.

839
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:26,633
- [LAUGHS]

840
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,467
- SHE WAS KIND OF ILL-PREPARED,
BUT SHE WAS GOOD.

841
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,667
- RIGHT.
- THE "BITCHING," SHE GETS IT.

842
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,900
AND I THINK WHEN SHE DOES
NURTURE HER INNER TALENT,

843
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,333
SHE'S GOING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE.

844
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,166
- YEAH, BUT THAT
MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

845
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
NEXT, BENDELACREME.

846
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,800
- THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
WHO'S A STAR.

847
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,467
- SHE WAS INCREDIBLE.

848
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,567
IF DELA HAD BEEN
ON THE WINNING TEAM,

849
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN

850
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,600
THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.

851
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:49,567
- YEAH.

852
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,867
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
VIVACIOUS.

853
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,266
- THAT LOOK WAS DATED.

854
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT EVEN
READS LIKE BEING FEMININE.

855
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,934
- UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE DIDN'T BRING IT ON.

856
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:02,367
TO BE A TALKING HEAD,
YOU GOT TO LET IT OUT,

857
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,567
EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST...

858
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,967
GIVING HEAD.

859
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,266
- [LAUGHS]

860
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,066
- BUT I DO GIVE HER CREDIT
FOR STAYING TRUE TO WHO SHE IS.

861
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,633
- THAT CAN BE A HINDRANCE IF

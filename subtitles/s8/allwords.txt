You'll be working in pairs

-I immediately was like--
[trills tongue]
I wrote 30 pages.
-Damn, Thorgy.
-Every team is going to hope
that Bob and I fail.
Why?
[laughter]
<i>-But we both want to win.</i>
-[cackles]
[laughter]
-I think we got everything.
-Do you want a shot
of Chi Chi drinking booze?
-I think I'm good.
-Okay.
-Thorgy Thor.
-I got totally confused
when you didn't say
anything about the booze.
-There were too many ideas.
-Chi Chi DeVayne.
-We just had
to push you a little bit
for you to be in your skin.
-Just be you.
Honey, that's why we sent you
a plane ticket.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen
and Derrick Barry.
-I would love to see
a fully realized
glamasaurus rex.
-Okay.
-Don't just give us
that same old pretty makeup.
Show us something
completely different.
-Condragulations.
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.
-Chi Chi DeVayne,
shantay, you stay.
-Thorgy Thor.
Sashay away.

♪ ♪
-Mmm.
-Whoo, mama.
-Goodness.
-Girl.
-Poor Thorgy.
-I cannot believe
that all happened.
-That was a--
that was a rough one.
-That was, like,
so emotional.
-"Please take down Bob.
She's terrible."
-[laughs]
-"Anyway, love you guys.
"Top three,
Naomi, Bob and Deryk.
That was shady.
Thorgy."
-There you have it, girl.
-Whoa, that was really shady.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Damn, Thorgy.</i>
But you're not here anymore,
so I guess it really
doesn't matter, huh?
-I thought we had
a special connection.
-Well, you realize
that's so typical Thorgy.
I mean,
that's my homegirl.
I was so excited to see her
when I got here.
And I was sad to see her go.
<i>-[Bob]  Even though she got</i>
<i>competitive with me,</i>
that's Thorgy.
I love her anyway.
<i>And I really am gonna miss her.</i>
That was a lip-sync
for the ages, mama.
-That was epic.
-I'm at a loss for words,
'cause it was so unexpected.
Child, I'm gonna erase
this shit.
<i>-[Chi Chi] Real talk, y'all?</i>
Derrick's ass should've
been lip-synching tonight,
and I know I'm not
the only girl
that's thinking it.
-When they said that
Derrick was in the top,
I was like, "Okay,
I did not see that."
-That's where her jealousy
kicked in.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Purely based</i>
<i>on the runway look,</i>
I think Derrick should've
been in the bottom.
<i>Derrick's black-and-white</i>
<i>runway</i>
<i>looked like he stepped</i>
out of the thrift store
bargain sale day.
-Bob and I
smeared the shit
out of each other
like Ru told us to do,
so I felt like Bob and I won.
I think the other queens,
those bitches better be scared,
because now I'm competition.
Oh, you didn't win a challenge?
<i>Oh, I did?</i>
And I didn't have to do
anything Britney to win.
-I think it was your ensemble
that they read you for.
Your outfit.
-Yeah, I think that's
where all the negative was.
And they want you to start
carving yourself.
-It's just funny to me,
because this is my drag.
-First let's start with
blocking those brows down
and changing your paint.
Derrick paints
like a real woman would paint,
and that's not drag.
-The thing is, they have seen
this look from you,
so I think they want to see
something else you can do
with a higher arch brow--
-Yeah, and I get that.
I get that,
that I really didn't
change my makeup
besides doing black and white,
but I wanted to look
like an old movie star.
-I'll tell you this.
If they tell you to do
more draggy, block that brow.
-Yeah.
-Bring it up to your goddamn
fuckin' hairline.
-Right.
If I come out, and I do not
have my brow raised,
there is no excuse
for me to be here.
-Derrick talking about
she gonna change her makeup,
do this, do that.
<i>Like, girl, we've been telling</i>
<i>you that from the beginning.</i>
Like, what the fuck?
-Oh, my goodness.
-Girl, it is too damn late.

-Oh!

-Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
-Ladies, at this point
in the competition,
you're family.
And sometimes, to bring sisters
closer together,
it's good to do
some family role-playing.
And we're gonna do it
with puppets.
[cheers and applause]
Why?
all: 'Cause everybody
loves puppets.
-Everybody love puppets.
[laughter]
Pick a puppet that represents
one of your competitors,
and drag it up.
First up, Kim Chi.
-All right, girl.
-Dig deep for a puppet.
Who is it?
-Chi Chi.
-Oh, no.
-All right, next up,
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Oh, dear.
Ooh!
-[gasps]
-It's--
-Derrick Barry.
[laughter]
-I have Bob The Drag Queen.
-[Bob] They gave me hair.
That was nice.
[laughter]
-Next up, Derrick Barry.
-Ooh!
-The hair!
[laughter]
-I got Naomi.
-All right, Naomi.
Vogue over to the hole.
-Kack-k-k-kack
ka-kack-ka-kack, pow.
-Derrick Barry.
-It's gonna be even worse
than her snatch game.
-All right, Bob, you're up.
-Kim Chi!
-Yay!
-Look at Kim Chi go.
Oops! Oh, no!
[laughter]
Oh, shit!
[laughter]
-All right, ladies.
You have 20 minutes
to drag up your puppets.
Go.
-All right!
[upbeat music]
-I need the tiniest lashes
possible for Derrick.
-Wow.
I wear 301s, cunt.
-Okay, let me get the fabric
that is the cheapest,
without a sparkle, for Naomi.
-Because I don't have
to rely on fabric.
-You do have to rely on
your body, though, apparently.
-Oh, snap.
<i>Derrick and Naomi,</i>
I think they're getting
tired of each other.
-Wow.
-Remember, honey.
I paint for
the Las Vegas stage,
where you actually have
to look like someone.
You just have
to look like Raven.
-No, I have my own
drag aesthetic.
It's called Naomi Smalls.
-Mmm.
It's called Naomi Smalls?
Keep giving me material, honey.
-Ooh!
-Time's up, ladies.
Let the bitch fest begin.
Coming to the stage, Kim Chi.
I used to be 350 pounds.
And what did you
get down to?
349.
Oh, my God!
Condragulations, girl.
Well, the camera adds
ten pounds.
I ate, like, seven cameras.
Do you have a bit
of a speech impediment?
Speech impediment?
Oh, my God!
Kim, this is ridiculous.
Thank you.
Bye, Kim.
Oh, fuck.
-All right, this is Kim Chi.
And--oh, Chi Chi,
you're still here.
[laughter]
Ooh, um, the judges keep
telling you the word titties,
and all I can see
is your boy nipples.
Shit.
I'm a cheap queen.
Let's talk about
your two-inch heels.
[laughter]
They coming to the stores,
I paid 100 bucks.
When I saw the bag,
it said $14.99.
Why does your hair bump
never blend in to your hairline?
<i>-Bitch, my hair is blended in.</i>
Most of the time, girl.
-See, I told you,
I'm a cheap queen.
-So, Naomi, I'm wondering.
Is this your roller girl look,
neon look,
or Madonna kimono look?
They're all the same.
[laughter]
<i>[dopey music]</i>
-No, ma'am.
I have never looked like that
in my entire life.
I would never wear some
shake and go Beyoncé wig.
-There's one thing
I do want to talk--
Ooh, you're doing
a split, girl.
That's the most talented thing
I think I've seen you do
on this competition.
-Damn, Derrick,
you are cutting deep, bitch.
<i>This is a puppet show.</i>
Kids are here.
-The one thing
I want to talk to you about
is your snatch game.
Your New York was really bad.
-Damn, shady.
-Oh, Flavor Flav!
No, you didn't!
Okay, try to do that.
[monotone]
Oh, Flavor Flav.
Oh, no, you didn't.
-Derrick, does it hurt,
me having my hand inside you?
No, I'm used to sitting on
two dicks at one time.
[laughter]
<i>-[Bob] Derrick and Naomi,</i>
<i>they're like Tom and Jerry.</i>
Like NeNe Leakes
and Kim Zolciak.
-Derrick,
tell me about your drag.
Well, I don't really
have a drag style.
There is no Derrick Barry.
There is Britney Spears.
But I hand-sewed
this piece of fabric
that's just buttoned up
around my waist.
[laughter]
-That sucked.
-Hey, everybody.
I'm Bob The Drag Queen.
Hey, Bob, how you doing?
I'm doing well.
I talk a lot.
I work at every club
in New York.
[laughter]
I have a big mouth!
I think I'm all that,
even though my wigs
look like Chi Chi's.
Yeah!
Jokes, jokes, jokes,
jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.
So what are you gonna do
when you run out of jokes?
I know what I'll do.
Walk into the club purse first.
Bam!
[laughter]
Walk into the club purse first.
Bam!
New York, baby!
[laughter]
-Wow.
So you bitches
just didn't hold anything back,
did you?
The winner
of today's mini challenge is...
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Whoa!
[cheers and applause]
-I never lose a challenge.
[laughter]
-All right, ladies.
For this week's maxi challenge,
we're having a book ball.
-[laughs]
Oh, word.
-Now, in honor
of our guest judge,
author and humorist
David Sedaris...
[cheers]
I'm challenging you
to put together
three different looks
that tell the story
of your life.
First category is
Baby Drag Realness.
You know, when you were
five years old,
and you slipped
on those first pair of heels?
Second category is
That's My Mama Realness.
A drag look that pays tribute
to your own sweet mama.
Third category is
Autobiographical
Eleganza Extravaganza!
A couture creation
made entirely...
out of books.
-Ooh.
-Oh.
-#RuPaulBookBall.
[laughter]
For your first two looks,
you can use clothes,
shoes, and accessories
from the Out of the Closet
Thrift Store.
Gentleman, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
[cheers and applause]
-Is that really how I sound?
How Derrick did my puppet?
-Is that really how I sound?
You're like Paris Hilton.
It's just like
giving me one note.
-Damn.
-I actually thought
that was very clever.
-You're not mad at it?
-No.
-Oh, cool.
-Not at all.
Bitch, I have tough skin.
-It looks like it.
-[scoffs]
You really testing out that
tough skin, ain't you, girl?
-And Derrick has thin hair.
-Ha-ha!
-[squeals]
[laughter]
-Wow.
I also have a career
with my wigs on.
You'll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.
-Baby.
-Popcorn.
[crunches]
-The fun thing
about Naomi is
she only has one thing to say.
And then she has
to think for, like,
hours to come with another read.
-[crunches]
-I have one thing to say.
I'm not that smart.
-Whoa.
-Were you upset by my puppet?
-I honestly don't remember
what you said.
-Everything was factual.
-[laughs]
-Why do you guys
hate each other?
Can't you guys just get along?
God damn it.
-I do not hate Derrick.
I do not like his drag.
-This is getting intense.
-You don't hate me;
you just hate my drag.
-There, exactly.
-Yeah.
-It's gonna
get severe up in here!
[laughter]
It's gonna get severe
up in here.
Gat, gat, boom!
<i>-[Chi Chi] Derrick and Naomi</i>
are starting World War III
in this bitch.
Y'all is going for blood
today.
The shit has hit the fan,
honey.
-This week's challenge
is the Book Ball.
<i>We have to come up</i>
<i>with three looks.</i>
So we have Baby Drag,
a mama look, and Book Drag,
where we have to design
a high fashion costume
out of books.
-Watch out
for the paper cuts, ladies.
-Hey, sexy librarians.
all: Hi!
Hello!
-Hi, Derrick Barry.
-Hi, Ru.
-You're cutting up my book.
-I know.
My Eleganza Extravanganza
is taking elements of your book
and mixing them
with famous paintings.
Because I feel like
celebrity female impersonation
is such an art form.
-Right.
But you've come
under a lot of fire
in terms of aesthetic.
And also last week, the judges
called you out on your makeup,
specifically to make
it look more draggy.
'Cause you paint.
You just paint what's there.
Do you know how to paint
an illusion on your face?
-Yes.
I will definitely be
giving you a brow.
-Yes, darling.
-Definitely, darling.
-If the judges
want me to wipe my eyebrow out
and draw on a new one,
I'm gonna do that.
<i>I'm ready to take a risk,</i>
and I want to show the judges
I came here
to really challenge myself.
-Why, Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hey, Ru the Q.
-What are you gonna do
for your Mama Drag look?
-My mother,
to me she's high glam.
She always wears platinum
blonde hair, long eyelashes.
She loves leopard.
She's a party girl.
I definitely get my ability
to dance from my mom.
I didn't realize it
until we went to,
<i>like, a wedding one time.</i>
Lady know how to cut a rug.
-Now, tell me this.
What are you gonna do
for your Eleganza Extravaganza?
-I'm the unconventional queen.
I've worked with paper before,
so I'm just going
to wow you guys.
-Well, Chi Chi,
remember what was said
last week.
We want Chi Chi.
Now, we want
an elevated Chi Chi.
We want you to be refined.
We say country,
that's not a bad word.
-Yeah.
-It's flavor.
Savor in it.
-Okay.
-Bask in it.
Never be ashamed of it.
-I'm realizing
that country is in.
<i>So I guess I got</i>
<i>to heighten what I do.</i>
I just want to pull it off.
I want to do good.
-Well, hello there, Bob.
-Hey, RuPaul.
-Now, last week, the judges,
Michelle, specifically,
called you out to see
if you could do glamazon drag.
-I'm gonna go glamorous
for my book look.
So I'm taking this corset.
I've already got
three pieces glued down.
Look at me go.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-Do a corset
that kind of branches out,
goes past the bosoms.
-Yes.
-Then I'm gonna do
like a gradient color.
-Well, 'cause you know,
Michelle
calls your drag ratchet drag.
-Yeah.
-I am in love with
the way you look tonight.
Less ratchet, more fashion.
-Do you call your drag
ratchet drag?
-I've never called it ratchet,
but that term doesn't offend me.
-Is that a conscious decision?
-It's a conscious decision.
'Cause if you come
to one of my shows,
it's like me
on stage by myself
for an hour and a half.
And if I'm gonna be in, like,
a gown with huge earrings
and big old sculpted up-do,
by the time my show's done,
my eyebrows become my moustache,
I'm sweating.
See what I mean?
So I'm gonna show up
in a leotard.
-You're so confident.
What scares you?
-My mom got sick recently.
She has, like, a chronic
and really rare form
of pneumonia called BOOP,
which sounds cute,
but it's not
that cute, actually.
I got the scariest call,
which is like,
"You need to come here."
I was, like, really freaked out.
-Yeah, yeah.
<i>-My mom had been</i>
<i>very physically fit,</i>
<i>and then she was just,</i>
<i>like, skinny and frail, and,</i>
like, her hair was falling out.
And she couldn't do anything.
Like, anything.
-Wow.
-I mean, it was really hard
to see my mom like that.
<i>[somber music]</i>
♪ ♪
All of the things
in my life that,
like, make me a good person are
because my mom
taught me to do it.
I don't have a lot of people
like my mom in my family.
[crying softly]
Fuckin' got me, you bitch.
-Wow.
That's pretty rough.
What do you think your mom
would think about you
in this competition?
-[laughs]
My mom thinks
I'm the best ever.
My mom is the funniest
person I know.
My mom is my hero,
<i>and she showed me</i>
<i>that you can do anything.</i>
More importantly,
come through anything.
-All right.
Well, I want to see
gorgeous Bob The Drag Queen.
-Note taken.
-All right.
Thanks.
-Here we go, girl.
-Hi, Naomi.
-Hi, Ru.
-Now, this is of course
an autobiographical challenge.
-Yes.
-We're looking for your story.
Who are you?
-I'm Naomi Smalls.
-Yeah, that's kind of vague.
I want more.
How are you going to insert
more of you into this challenge?
-My mom is such a huge part
of who I am.
I'm such a huge fan of hers.
-And she had how many kids?
-She had one
in her first marriage,
and my dad had two
in his first marriage,
and they got together
and they had one,
and then eight
of them are adopted.
-And that is...
-That's 12.
-12.
Wow.
-For That's My Mama Realness,
I want to portray
what a classic beauty my mom is.
<i>She doesn't need huge hair</i>
<i>and big diamonds.</i>
She doesn't need anything
to amp her up.
She just knows she's perfect
in my eyes.
-Now, a few weeks ago,
you were almost fading
into the background.
-Right.
-But you came up from behind
and just knocked 'em dead.
-Well, I'm actually
kind of thankful
that I was in the bottom two,
because it literally lit a fire
underneath my ass.
This is what I want to do,
and I should just
fuckin' bring it
every single time.
-Well, you know, two weeks ago,
it was a design challenge
that you won.
-Mm-hmm.
-And I want
that same excitement
from you in this challenge.
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm just
nervous, because the judges
like what I'm doing so far,
and I don't want to give them
any reason to doubt me.
I want to prove to them
that I'm not a one-hit wonder.
-Well, I can't wait to see
what you're going to do.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Get back to work.
-Hi, Kim Chi.
-Hi, Ru.
-You're a design queen.
-Yes, I am.
-So this is something
you can sink your teeth into.
What are you planning?
-With all three of the runways,
it's kind of like
a visual fairy tale.
So I'm going to start off
as a little sprout.
-Uh-huh.
-And through drag,
I blossom into the artist
that I'm going to become.
-Wow.
So, now, this challenge
has a part
that pays homage
to your mother.
What is that gonna look like?
-Oh, my gosh.
So this one I'm really
excited about.
I brought a traditional
Korean hanbok,
<i>because my mother</i>
<i>taught me to be proud</i>
of who I am and my heritage.
-It's something
your mother has worn before?
-Yes.
-Has she seen you in drag?
-She doesn't know
that I do drag.
-What?
-I know.
My mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.
-You know she's gonna
see this show.
Are you afraid?
-I am a bit afraid
that she might see
all of this as,
like, a waste of time.
I just want my mom
to be able to be proud of,
like, everything that I do.
You know, the person
that I am today.
-You think she doesn't
know that already?
-I don't think so, no.
-Hmm.
<i>[plaintive music]</i>
-Have you never
shown her that side of you?
-Not really,
'cause I just
don't like being
vulnerable with my mom.
-Right.
-'Cause then she might think
that I'm a weak person,
and I want to portray myself
as anything but that.
<i>-[Bob] I think that Kim</i>
<i>should tell her mom.</i>
'Cause I feel like
if you're not really
opening yourself up
to your family,
<i>then you're robbing them</i>
<i>of the experience</i>
of getting to know
and experience you
for who you are.
I mean, in theory, I know Kim
better than her fuckin' mom
knows her.
That's not fair.
-Is that why you got
so emotional on the runway
when you were being critiqued?
-I felt like I tried my best,
but it just didn't work out.
So I just got really frustrated.
-I just felt
like there was a sense of shame
when you broke down.
Somehow they're
all linked together.
I'm not sure how.
And that's what I'm
trying to get at.
<i>-[Kim] I'm very hard on myself</i>
<i>about being perfect.</i>
Especially growing up,
because I wasn't
the model child,
and I was the "artistic" one.
<i>And last week's performance</i>
<i>was a letdown,</i>
because I feel like
my mom probably
wouldn't be proud
of what I did.
-I just want to do really well
in this competition.
-You have done really well.
It's top five.
You are so talented.
Everybody knows that about you.
But do you know it?
-I know it, yeah.
-But do you own it?
-I will own it.
-Will own it?
After this challenge,
or later this--
-No, right now. I will own it.
-Okay.
I need you to really
hear yourself say that,
because that's the key
to this competition.
If you see it,
we can see it, you know?
All right, get back to work.
-Thank you.
-Ladies!
Gather round.
Now, listen,
I've got good news.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
in addition to
David Sedaris,
we will be joined
by his twisted sister...
-[gasps]
-Actress and author
Amy Sedaris will be here.
[cheers and applause]
Oh, right, and there's
one more thing.
In addition
to your three Book Ball looks,
you'll be performing
an opening number.
A tribute
to Amy's comedy classic,
"Strangers With Candy"
in full
Jerri Blank-inspired drag.

-That's gonna be ridiculous.
-So Chi Chi,
you won the mini challenge,
so you're in charge
of the choreography.
-[laughter]
-So good luck,
you boozers, users, and losers.
And don't fuck it up.
-All right.
-Down to production.
<i>-[Chi Chi] For today's</i>
<i>challenge,</i>

<i>It's a tribute</i>
<i>to Jerri Blank,</i>
<i>the character Amy Sedaris</i>
<i>plays on the TV show</i>
<i>"Strangers With Candy."</i>
<i>It's about embodying</i>

shady shit all the time.
-Oh, we can't say things

-Let's start from the beginning.
We're gonna have--

Got it?
-No.
[laughs]
-Okay, let's do it again.
-Wait. So when I--
I get to the end,
I do it step turn this way?
-[Bob] Why not for this time
you stand behind me,
so you can actually see someone
doing it in front of you?
-Okay, that sounds much better.
[laughs]
-Ready, and--
[humming]
♪ ♪
Got it?
-There's the walking.
It's literally,
walk, walk, walk, turn.
-Oh, God.
-Start over.
-Hey, hey,
I've got something to say.
I was a teenage runaway.
Thrown in jail.
Wha--
-So Kim Chi.
-I'm worried that
I might lose this challenge
just because I can't dance,
and I don't want that to happen.
-Come on, let's do it again.
I'ma watch it
this time, guys.
-I was a teenage runaway,
I was a boozer
and a user
and don't forget, a loser!
-Bob can actually dance.
I don't know
why she plays it down
that she's just a comedian.
Girl can dance.
But I don't know how
these other girls are gonna do.
I don't know, girl.
-I was a big fan of the pole.
Also love the hole.
-Naomi, she's still modeling,
she's still voguing,
and oh,
oh, and oh.
She's not kind of channeling
that ugliness of Jerri Blank.
-You're walking like a model.
And I need you to walk
like Jerri Blank.
Yeah, think a hunchback.
-There you go.
-Yeah.
-She has a FUPA.
-Think scoliosis,
like you had in high school.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I actually have</i>
<i>no idea</i>
who the fuck is Jerri Blank.
What's "Strangers With Candy"?
Somebody please tell me.
[laughter]
-Think, like, first
of all, do this face,
and then come down and--
[vocalizing]
-Derrick is doing this,
like, weird thing.
She's playing like a fuckin'
caveman almost.
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the fuck she's doing.</i>
-This is the sexiest
you've ever looked.
<i>-We down to the top five.</i>
I ain't gonna correct her.
-[sighs]
-Whoo.
-So we're back
in the work room,
<i>and it's crunch time.</i>
-Make it or break it right now.
-We have a short
amount of time,
so it's work, work, work.
[sewing machine whirring]
<i>-I'm nervous</i>
<i>about this challenge.</i>
I'm trying to prove
that I can be glamorous.
<i>But this is not</i>
<i>my field of expertise.</i>
I don't work with unconventional
materials at home.
This is very stressful.
It's a lot of shit.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, there's
just so much to do.
This is, like, crazy.
-For my book drag,
I decided to use cardboard.
Because I want, like,
a really structured dress.
I'm taking
some very bold moves.
I'm not sewing anything.
-Thank God.
-All hot glue and spray paint.
-I mean, well, bitch,
somebody got to go home.
-[chuckling]
Oh, yeah.
-Bob's using more cardboard
than she is books.
<i>That's not the challenge.</i>
<i>Honey, you got it all wrong.</i>
You're in for a rude
awakening, girl.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] For today's</i>
<i>maxi challenge,</i>
we're getting ready
for the Book Ball.
This challenge is
literally super-important,
because it decides
who makes the top four.
It's a huge deal.
-So, do you guys feel,
like, a lot of pressure
about being top five
and having to perform well?
-I think it would suck
especially to go home right now.
'Cause it's literally
so close you can taste it.
-Do you think you
hands-down deserve to win?
-Yeah.
I think everyone
should have that mentality.
-Agreed.
-Most definitely.
-Why do you think
you deserve to win?
-I've got the best grades
in school.
-But when you look at
RuPaul's beauty and grace,
do you feel
like you possess that,
because I don't see,
in the past winners,
the beauty that they have.
-Damn.
-That bitch
just called you ugly.
-No, no, no.
[laughter]
I've just never heard them
ever say to a previous winner
that they did ratchet drag.
-All the queens
think that I can't be glamorous
because Michelle called me
ratchet one time, in a good way.
And it's all they can cling to,
especially Derrick.
You keep thinking ratchet drag
means something bad.
Ratchet and like, this idea
of somebody being raggedy
are not the same thing.
-But Bob, I've seen,
like, your videos online,
and I think you're very funny,
but, like, the first thing
I thought was, like,
she literally wears lips
and lashes.
-Whoo.
-I guess,
but I mean, I do my thing.
You know, people
will come to my show.
-I just think, like,
makeup is very important
because the moment people
look at you,
that's the first thing you see.
-Yeah.
-I also want to say,
my makeup's
not that fuckin' bad.
-Ooh.
-You guys act like I have,
like, the worst makeup
in "Drag Race" history.
Granted, it's not the best.
I am no makeup artist.
-I don't think
your makeup is terrible,
it just looks like
you're not wearing any.
-It's a bit of a shock,
people thinking
that my makeup is so bad,
'cause no one's ever
read me for my makeup.
-I don't think you even
try to, like,
add more dimensions
with your makeup.
-I do feel, though,
the judges say,
"Oh, I can see you're trying."
-I think the judges
are comparing Bob to himself.
<i>But if you compare Bob</i>
<i>to me and Naomi,</i>
Bob's makeup is nonexistent.
I'm not, you know, like,
putting your talents down.
But I just think, like,
if all people have to see
is, like, your pictures,
to, like, judge you--
-Because there is, like,
a standard with drag.
Especially "Drag Race."
You have to have your makeup
at a certain level.
You have to have your wigs
at a certain level.
<i>-They're absolutely right.</i>
I pay more attention
to my performances
than I do to my makeup.
But what matters is,
are you delivering a product
to people who want to buy it.
That's what matters.
So if your thing is beauty,
then yeah, beauty matters a lot.
But my goal is to be
an entertainer.
And I am an entertainer.
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm not saying
that you should just be
beautiful,
and you should win
because it's a beauty pageant.
But you don't have to be
a fuckin' stand-up comedian,
or just a live singer
or a dancer.
-Why you coming--
why you coming for me, bitch?
-There is definitely
a beauty standard
when it comes to drag.
You could be doing
an amazing death drop,
but it's not gonna be
as impressive
if you look a fuckin'
busted mess.
-My name's Bennett,
and I'm not in it,
but I will say is I do think...
-You in it now, bitch.
-I think you need a talent
to not only win
but to make money in the future.
Like, I'm a dancer.
Everybody knows that I dance.
Everybody knows Bob does--
-Everything.
[laughter]
-Everybody knows.
-Whoo!
-Not makeup.
-I think you need
some kind of talent.
I mean, Naomi,
I look at you as a model.
-Oh!
-And to me,
that's the only that I've--
you know what I mean,
that I've seen.
That's what I get from you.
-Right, I agree.
I think you're
gonna take great photos,
but that does not take talent.
-Being a drag queen
is such a talent.
You are a performer.
You have to be a makeup artist,
you have to be a hairstylist,
you have to be--
-So if you're a hairstylist,
why haven't you glued down
your lace fronts?
-Oh, shit.
The library has opened again.
<i>Insert shady rattlesnake</i>
<i>noise here.</i>
Roo koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-
koo-koo-koo-koo.
-Bitch, glue down your brows,
and then I'll glue down my lace.
-I cannot wait
to see a shot of you
and have screen caps go around,
and it's just lifted lace.
-And you know
what yours is gonna be?
It's gonna be so much light
reflected off that forehead,
because there's
no brow on there.
-[laughs]
I love that you two
can't let it go.
Derrick, you and I are not
frenemies any more.
You two are almost enemies
at this point, girl.
-And I didn't get the challenge
to do my brows
until my last challenge.
-But the judges
told you to do that.
The judges haven't told me
to glue down my wigs yet.
They're telling you
to change up your makeup
and carve out your face.
<i>-Do you not understand</i>
<i>what I do for a living?</i>
I don't carve my face out.
There's no lines on my face.
<i>That's not gonna look</i>
<i>like a female illusion.</i>
That's going to look
like drag makeup.
Not one time
did they tell me
that my makeup is not good.
-And I'm telling you,
like, as a friend,
change up your makeup.
It's not me digging at you.
-There are some digs in there.
[laughs]
-But, Naomi,
why would I change my makeup
when I impersonate
Britney Spears for a living?
-And that's why it bugs me.
Because we're coming
into this competition,
and we're representing
ourselves.
We're not representing
a celebrity.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I feel like</i>
<i>I'm telling Derrick</i>
what the judges
have been tiptoeing
around this entire time.
And literally someone just needs
to be blunt about it,
<i>because Derrick</i>
<i>is not understanding it.</i>
And even though Derrick
never really asked me,
but someone needs
to tell him the truth.
Who is Derrick Barry?
Chad came here
with his own aesthetic.
He wasn't doing Cher
the entire time.
-Chad had been doing drag
for years, and--
-And so have you.
-And not impersonating Cher.
-Okay.
Like, when you're coming
to represent you
as a drag queen,
not Britney Spears,
why wouldn't you come
as Derrick Barry?
-Being compared to
Britney Spears in the slightest
is the biggest compliment
in the world.
And if I have to change
my face to be myself,
then I'm not really
being myself.
I just think that you've been
upset with me doing well
in times where you didn't,
so you take digs at me
to make yourself feel better.
-I disagree with Derrick
saying that Naomi goes after him
because she's insecure.
Naomi sees Derrick's skill level
as not being up to par
with everybody else,
and that's why she's frustrated
that Derrick Barry's still here.
-Am I the first person
who's ever
said anything like this,
ever, to you?
-That has said
my makeup is not good?
-I didn't say
your makeup's not good.
It's just not drag.
-These are the most octaves
I've ever heard Naomi speak in,
that's for sure.
You get her excited, girl,
she becomes
Mariah Carey, honey.
-[laughs]
-I just have never said
that you don't belong here,
so for you to say
that I don't belong here--
-I never said
you don't belong here,
it's just that we literally--
-You did.
You said it bugs you
that I'm here.
-No, the thing
that bugs me is
that you are here
finding who you are,
this entire journey.
And we all came here
with our own fuckin' aesthetic.
-Whoo!
-I'm here
in this room with you
right now in the top five.
-Okay.
I'm so annoyed.
[laughs]
[dramatic music]
-When's dinner?
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[laughter]
-Wow.
-Oh.
-We are getting ready
for the Book Ball.
<i>And we are all feeling</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>
This is the challenge
that is going to determine
who's gonna be
in the top four.
The heat is on.
-Is there anything
about the runway
that you're worried about?
-There's a chance
I might not use the bottom
of my outfit.
You know when you
spray paint something
but it's laying down,
then you lift it up
and things are showing that
weren't showing before?
-Yeah.
-But they want me
to be glamorous,
so I want to wear a gown.
-Short can be glamorous.
Glamorous just
doesn't mean like a mermaid,
like, long silhouette.
-Yeah, but she's like,
full-on glamour.
So I made this mermaid gown.
But it's hard to walk in,
<i>and I think I can be glamorous</i>
<i>without wearing a dress</i>
<i>the size of Kentucky.</i>
This is a risk
I'm willing to take.
-Derrick?
-Hi.
-My mirror's right here.
-I don't feel good about what
happened with Derrick yesterday.
I feel like my mom would've,
like, really, like,
slapped my hand about that.
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to bury the hatchet.
So if he needs a zip-up,
if he needs advice,
if he needs anything,
I will definitely be the one
to give it to him.
-I'm going to powder
and then glue again.
Is that what you do?
-Well, I don't cover my--
-Oh, you don't glue down,
that's right.
-But when it comes down to time
to shape, let me know.
-Yeah.
<i>The judges have asked me,</i>
so for the first time
in this competition,
I am blocking out my brows.
Ooh.
<i>I am going for</i>
<i>three different brow looks.</i>
I just want to show
that I'm comfortable
being a different character
out there.
I want my brow like here,
and then out.
Does that sound right?
-You can start....
[inaudible conversation]
-Okay
[trimmer running]
[inadubile conversation
continues]
-No.
[inadubile conversation
continues]
<i>-I'm proud</i>
<i>that he's trying</i>
to give the judges
something new,
<i>but he only wants to ask me</i>
<i>about his eyebrows,</i>
<i>and changing up your face</i>
is so much more
than just eyebrows.
But I'm giving Derrick space,
because I don't
want him to think
that I'm coming for him
about his makeup.
-What are you doing
for your mom look?
-She wore this blue dress
in our family photo,
and I did a take on that,
but it's more sheer.
-Uh-huh.
What's your relationship like?
-My mom was
great growing up.
She was my best friend.
When I came out to her
when I was 19,
that's when everything changed.
<i>When I came out to my mom,</i>
I thought she would embrace me
with open arms.
And I got the complete
opposite reaction.
The only thing she said was,
"Do you mind
if I keep this under my hat?"
-When she said that,
did you take, like,
super offense?
-I, like, shut down.
I wish I had not told her.
Her opinion changed of me,
and my opinion had changed
of her at that point, you know?
-Damn.
<i>-That's why I have a lot</i>
<i>of empathy for Kim Chi.</i>
Because I know that when a kid
feels broken down
by their parents,
it's something that will always
be in the back of their mind.
And I feel like my mom broke me,
and I just never--
I never got put back together.
-How's your relationship
now with your mom?
-It's better.
My mom has always
been a believer in my talent,
and taught me to shoot
for the stars.
And the worst that can happen
is you land on the moon.
-I love it.
You got a great mom, kid.
[laughter]
Let me see?
Look at me,
straight on.
Relax.
-Like, that is.
[laughter]
That's relaxed.
-Oh my goodness, girl.
Ooh.
That's all I can say is,
"Ooh, my goodness."
[laughter]
-You look so different.
I mean, a completely
different person.
-Really?
<i>-Everyone clowns me</i>
<i>for my makeup skills,</i>
<i>but it's not as bad as Derrick.</i>
It is bad.
I'm seeing tremendous effort
and fearlessness,
and on the other hand,
I'm seeing someone's dad
doing drag for the first time.
Welcome to the stage.
-Really?
-Yeah.
-I feel like I drew
this one higher to offset that.
-Coming to this competition,
I think Derrick should have
practiced covering his brows
at least once,
because perfecting
your drag makeup
takes a long time,
and trying to achieve that,
all of that in two hours?
-Oh, my God.

I--I love her so much.
Um, I just hope she's
proud of me, 'cause I love her.
-Do you have a message
you want to say to your mother?
-Thank you for everything
you've ever done.
And I hope I can repay you
for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry.
[sobs]
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.
Up next, Bob The Drag Queen.
-I thought
in the baby challenge,
you actually looked
like you weren't trying
to be too pretty about it.
You just seemed real to me.
And I thought you did
a great job reading your script.
It sounded really enthusiastic
and flowed really well.
-Tonight I challenged
you to be glamorous.
-Mm-hmm.
-I think that
you're most of the way there.
I think your makeup
looks pretty,
and I think your body's
always on point.
But I am not
getting book at all.
I'm getting cardboard.
-Well,
there is some cardboard in here,
but I don't have
any pages from my book.
-Why not?
-Well, I had this mermaid
bottom that had pages,
but once I finally saw it,
I was like,
mmm, it's a little much.
-But you took off the part
that actually is the challenge.
-Well, I'm still wearing books,
I'm just not wearing pages.
It's a book.
-Okay.
-Don't listen to them.
Yeah, maybe it's not made
out of the pages,
but I like the color,
and I like that it is different,
and it's kind of shingle-like.
You have beautiful legs,
and I love what you did
with your hair.
-I was going to wear a wig,
but I was like, uh.
-Right.
[laughter]
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Bob.
-Thank you.
-All right, up next.
Derrick Barry.
-I have seen what you've done
with your eyebrows.
I acknowledge that you're
trying something different.
But it's going to be
a journey for you.
This, tonight, for me,
I just thought
it was way too plain,
and way too basic.
-But I like that it looks
like you have a real vagina.
-She does.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-My mom would be so proud.
-Oh, yeah?
-Derrick, I see you trying
harder than anyone else,
and that I applaud.
But I think
you're getting lost
in what we want.
-Okay.
-We want you to do you
at this level.
And I don't know
that you're at this level.
-[RuPaul] All right, Chi Chi
DeVayne.
-Your dress tonight is really
one of my favorites.
-Thank you, Jesus.
-Each one of these looks
told a story
that made me get
to know you a little bit better,
especially with your mom.
Your mom is giving me
"Real Housewife" of
I hope my neighborhood.
[laughter]
-Real Housewives of Shreveport.
-Yeah.
-Everything that you read,
your voice
just really super sized it.
And I think you have
my favorite line
of the evening,
was that
"I'm just a country girl
with dreams."
[laughter]
You just seemed
really natural and honest,
and I think you did
a great job with that.
-Ooh, thank you.
-I completely disagree.
[laughter]
-Thank you, Chi Chi,
and thank you, ladies.
Now, while you go and curl up
with a good book backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, now,
just between us
best-selling authors,
what do you think?
Kim Chi.
-Kim Chi is a walking
art exhibit.
And tonight there was
so much emotion
with the stories of her mom.
-Who doesn't, by the way,
know that she does drag.
-There was absolutely no joy
when she was her mother.
She conveys a lot to me
by not saying anything.
-Yeah, there's a lot
to read between the lines there.
When she did her voice-over,
the conviction
wasn't quite there.
There's still a tentative thing.
And I think once her mother
gets to meet her,
and they get over
that part of it,
Kim Chi will fully blossom.
Naomi Smalls.
-Miss Underdog 2016.
-Yes.
-I mean, who saw this coming?
I am filled with joy for her.
She's just come full circle,
and at 21 years old,
listening to direction.
-Yes.
-And pushing herself.
-Naomi is checking every box
for me.
She is checking fashion
She is checking glamour.
She is checking performance.
She is checking heartstrings.
Now I find myself
rooting for her.
But is it too late?
-I don't think it's too late.
At least she got there.
-Better late than never.
-It's like a period.
-What's that?
-Something I had
a long time ago.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob, I thought,
nailed Jerri Blank.
Out of everybody,
she had the character the best.
What I don't like is the fact
that she wore a cardboard dress,
and books are not made
of corrugated cardboard.
-Don't judge a book
by its cover.
[laughter]
You know, I didn't mind
the dress or the cardboard.
At least he added
some color to it.
And he made me laugh,
just looking at him.
-You can just tell
that he's funny.
The humor kind
of just rolls off of him.
-Derrick Barry.
-I will commend Derrick
on going all the way.
To a different species,
which was--
-Feces?
What'd you say?
[laughter]
You hear what
you want to hear.
-Exactly.
[laughter]
-Uh-huh.
-However, it was just bad,
bad night in general
for Derrick.
She had, like,
two lines for blush,
instead of being contoured
and buffed out.
This is a drag competition.
Come dimensional.
When she reimagined her mother
on a sexy night in a nightgown,
that convoluted story
I can't even put my head around.
This is all a
fuckin' reach, okay?
The thing, you're on stage,
she glued your book to a corset
and put panties on
and she was done.
This was a miss tonight.
I'm sorry.
-Yes, Derrick's wasn't up
to par with the other girls,
but is anyone trying
harder than Derrick?
And that's got
to count for something.
-She's so willing
to receive the critique.
-But this is not the place
to find out who you are.
She's at her limit.
-Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Where Derrick
is getting our critiques
and getting lost in it,
Chi Chi is getting our critiques
and figuring it out.
And it's working.
This is when the horses
are rounding that--
I've never seen a horse race,
but when they go in there right
before they finish, and, like,
one of them sort of,
like, they start to separate?
-Yes, yes.
-This is that moment.
-Seabiscuit.
-Yes. She's--
-Yes.
-And I'm hung up on that horse.
-I thought her writing
was really good,
and I could listen
to hear talk forever.
She's just got such star power.
There's a genuineness
that flows off of her.
-Yes.
-For me, I'm gonna say
probably my favorite.
-Wow.
-Because neck and neck
with Kim Chi,
and what broke it was
the performance of Jerri,
took it over the top for me.
-But Kim Chi's mama drag,
it was so completely
compelling, so mournful
and so closeted, culturally.
And that, to me,
is real acting.
I just--completely
captivated by her.
-All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my...

I've made my decision.
Bob The Drag Queen,
shantay, you stay.
-Thank you.
I just want to say,
I probably had the biggest butt
of this season
with Derrick Barry,
and I ended up
being her biggest cheerleader
in this competition.
Even if you're afraid
of something,
she does it harder than anyone.
Honestly, I love her.
And I guess that was
the lesson we learned today.
[laughter]
-You may join the other girls.

You're so brave.
-Derrick Barry, you came here
as a Vegas headliner,
but you leave
an international star.
Stronger than yesterday.
-Thank you so much
for this opportunity.
I'm very proud,
and I'm humbled
by the experience
that you've given me.
And I don't want to cry,
but I'm going to because
that's just who I am.
And I thought for so long
I would just be lost
in Las Vegas,
and now I get to go
all around the world
and represent one
of my favorite icons.
So thank you so much.
-Thank you.
Thank you, Derrick.
Now, sashay away.

That‘s a wrap.

<i>What‘s done is done.</i>
<i>Now it‘s up to Ru.</i>
Judge, jury, and executioner.
All right, that‘s a wrap
on "The Realness," ladies.
-It was incredible.
-Excuse me, excuse me.
-Coming through.
-Oh, God.
Coming through.
-Perhaps you can help me.
-Okay.
I‘m here for the photo shoot,
the past winners‘ photo shoot.
[all laughing]
Oh, shit, Tyra,
you look horrible.
[laughing]
And Jinkx got a tan.
And you must be that sweet thing
that won season seven, right?
Whatever--oh, fuck.
This is season eight.
Bye.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
What the fuck?
[laughs]
Damn, bitch, you about
ten episodes late.
Where the fuck you been?
Is there no security

all: It‘s the last day
of school.
Sign my yearbook, everyone.
<i>It‘s our final day</i>
<i>in the workroom,</i>
and it feels like
it‘s our last day of school,
and we‘re finding out who‘s
gonna get valedictorian
or something.
What do each of you think
you‘ve learned
about yourself
throughout the competition?
I‘ve learned that apparently,
I can come off as very arrogant,
but I attribute it
to confidence.
<i>-(Bob)I‘ve not always been</i>
<i>this confident.</i>
I was like
a little chunky kid.
I was really effeminate.
I had really dark skin,
<i>and kids can be mean to you,</i>
<i>so once I found out</i>
<i>what I was good at</i>
<i>and I really embraced it,</i>
<i>people started to like me.</i>
Find something about you
that you like,
and focus on that.
<i>If I don‘t like my face,</i>
<i>if I don‘t like my skin,</i>
<i>if I don‘t like my weight,</i>
but I think to myself,
"I have nice teeth,"
and it may just start
with one tooth.
"Look at that tooth.
That‘s a nice tooth, man."
<i>And then once you can accept</i>
<i>that little thing</i>
about yourself,
you can just accept you
for who you are.
I‘ve learned
that I can‘t walk in heels.
I can‘t dance,
and I have a lisp.
[laughs]
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>you could be overweight,</i>
you could have a lisp,
you could have jacked-up teeth,
<i>but you too can turn it around.</i>
You know, people just, like,
like me for who I am
and I shouldn‘t try to be
anybody else.
First impression of Kim Chi,
I thought she was
very talented,
‘cause I already knew of Kim Chi
before I got here,
so I was, like,
already impressed
with her, and...
And then all that changed.
No, but, like, Kim is amazing.
Aww, you‘re amazing.
<i>I was a huge fan of Kim Chi</i>
<i>before I came here,</i>
and now she‘s one
of my best friends here.
She‘s, like, a big,
lovable panda.
I really don‘t know another way
to explain it.
DeVayne.
I--I didn‘t realize
how much I hated
where I was from
and how I talk.
I never, ever thought
I was funny.
Like, I never realized
all of that until I got here.
That‘s why I think you‘ve
grown the most, honestly.
-Yeah.
-This is why.
My journey in this competition
has been up and down.
<i>Making the top three would be</i>
a dream come true.
This means a whole lot to me.
I need to stop comparing
myself to others
and just appreciate what I have,
because what I have is amazing,
and I just need to own it.
I don‘t need to be doing
death drops
and stand-up comedy.
But you know who does
death drops?
Bob.
-[laughter]
-Known for her death drops.
I really did find myself here.
<i>That‘s, like, the best prize,</i>
and I‘m so proud of myself.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
And probably all of y‘all
I do not want to go home.
I do not want to go home,
either.
I just hate the fucking food
in California.
It‘s gross.
Whole Food and bullshit.
It‘s so good.
Kim, you like all the food
in the world.
-I mean
<i>-♪ All of the food ♪</i>
<i>♪ Of the world ♪</i>
<i>♪ All of the food ♪</i>

<i>Oh, remember your egg rolls? ♪</i>
[laughing]
While y‘all talking about me
eating turkey necks,
this bitch Kim Chi says she eats
fried chicken buttholes.
It‘s good.
I‘m kind of grossed out.
Yeah, that‘s gross, now.
You eat people‘s butthole.
Why is chicken any different?
[all laughing]
Touché, Kimberly.
Touché.

are undercooked!

Welcome to the main stage

Tonight, it‘s just family.
This week, we challenged
our top four queens
to star in the official
music video
of my song, "The Realness,"
and tonight, they‘re ready
to make us gag,
decked out in their
very best drag.
Gentlemen, start your engines,

Oh, which way are you going?
-[mouthing] That way.
-Oh, that way.
Apparently, she goes
both ways.
Oh!
-Kisses.
-Mm.
If you like it, then you

Ladies, here
at "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
we have the luxury
of celebrating who we are,
but we must never forget
that even today, there are
little boys and girls
who feel they don‘t fit in.
So I want you to turn back time
and share the wisdom
you have today
with the child you were then.
So Bob The Drag Queen...
-[laughing]
-Aww.
-This is you...
-That is me.
-At four years old.
-Yeah.
What do you have to say
to little Christopher?
I say, "Hey, girl."
I would tell myself, "You‘re
gonna want to change for others.
Do not do that."
I just wanted to be like
my brother or like my uncles.
I was so different than
every other guy in my family.
I just wanted to blend in
and be like them,
but once I realized how
important it really is
to be me,
then I really shone through.
And I would also say,
"Don‘t take out
that student loan
-freshman year of college."
-[laughs]
"Just pay out of pocket
like you did the rest of it,"
because it‘s still haunting me
to this day.
Thank you, Bob.
All right, Chi Chi DeVayne,
this is you at six years old.
What do you have to say
to little Zavion?
I would tell
little Zavion Davenport
that "It doesn‘t matter
where you‘re from
"and how you grew up,
"the neighborhood
you grew up in.
"That has nothing to do
with how far you can go.
"Never be ashamed
of how you walk, talk,
because that is going to be
the key to your success."
Very sweet.
-Thank you, Chi Chi.
-Thank you.
Kim Chi, this is you
at three years old.
Aww.
What do you have to say
to little Sang?
"Hi, Sang,
when you grow up,
"you‘re going to experience
a lot of different cultures.
"People might shame you
for being too different
"and not fitting in
with the rest of the culture.
"At times, you‘re gonna
feel like
"you‘re trapped
in the wrong body,
"and you‘re trapped in a place
where you feel like
[crying] "you can‘t get out,
and you
"at times, you‘re gonna want to
think about harming yourself
"or even running away.
"But I just wanted
to let you know
"that it will all get better,
"and once you grow up,
"the things
that you are ashamed of
are going to be the truth
that other people love you for."
-And...
-It‘s all right, baby.
"And you‘re gonna be able
to embrace them.
"You‘re gonna find a group
of friends who‘s gonna love you.
"You‘re not going to feel
lonely anymore,
"and what you thought
was all just a dream
"will come true for you,
because life will get better."
[crying]
Lovely.
Kim Chi, you didn‘t just
get better.
You got fierce.

"Oh, and go to a dancing class
as soon as possible."
Ha ha!
"You will really regret it
if you don‘t."
[all laughing]
All right, Naomi Smalls.
This is you at seven.
Aww.
What do you have to say
to little Davis?
"Davis, you‘re gonna go
through a really confusing time,
"where people are gonna make fun
of your mannerisms
"and the way that you look,
"but I just want you to know
"that you need to fucking
embrace it,
"because that‘s what
makes you special.
"Be proud that you‘re not like
all the other boys,
"and just do what you do best,
"and that‘s just being you,
‘cause that‘s what people
are gonna love you for."
Thank you, Naomi.
Condragulations, ladies.
Each of you made it
to the top four
the old-fashioned way.
You mother-tucking earned it,
but in very different ways.
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.
First up, Bob The Drag Queen.
-You can really dance.
-Thank you.
You come to life
when you use dance moves.
And you had
such great elegance
<i>and length to your body.</i>
<i>You made it look fabulous,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"Wow, Bob The Drag Queen</i>
is giving us some glamour."
Tonight, on the runway,
because we‘ve seen leggings
a lot from you,
I wish it would have just
gone that extra notch
to do a gown.
I was sort of torn
on the leggings,
which, by the way, is what
I would do to those leggings
-if I tried to put ‘em on.
-[laughs]
But I think this is a really
good place for your drag.
Let‘s talk about your journey.
You‘ve managed to do
a really good job
of standing out.
You have managed to be hilarious
throughout,
and you‘ve also listened
to the judges and grown.
I see an evolution with you.
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you.
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ooh, girl, you‘ve
come a long way
from Shreveport, Louisiana.
I heard that.
[all laughing]
Tonight, is it
the most creative thing
we‘ve ever seen
on the main stage?
No.
But you look stunning,
and I love the pageant hair.
It‘s one of my favorite things
in the world,
is that pageant hair
with the 18 buns on top.
The music video,
very nice job.
<i>That was, like, your moment</i>
<i>where you were living,</i>
‘cause you were, like,
in the mirror,
and you were all done up,
and it was just you being you.
The wind scene, you looked
gorgeous in that.
<i>Because you dance,</i>
you had the fluidity,
and you knew just what to do
on that black box.
[all laughing]
I have to talk
about some of your journey.
Your taste level was, um,
questionable.
Am I surprised
that you‘re here?
Yes, if I had a time machine
and came here now,
I would be shocked,
but you put in the work,
and I love a surprise ending.
You‘re like the M. Night
Shyama-lama-lan
of drag queens, right?
I didn‘t see this coming.
Our little girl has grown up.
Chi Chi, if I had moisture
left in my body,
I‘d probably
shed a tear tonight.
[all laughing]
But I dried up years ago.
Yes, everybody knows it.
Thank you, Chi Chi.
Up next, Kim Chi.
Even though we fought
this awkward body movement thing
this whole season,
I think you‘ve really
gotten to a place
where you can work it now.
For avant-garde, you were
like a glamorous,
Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.
It was so captivating.
And seeing your journey
of self-acceptance
and your journey
to challenge yourself
has been really impressive.
As a matter of fact,
in your entire journey,
I don‘t think there was one look
that you didn‘t kill,
and tonight is just the cherry
on top of the hot fudge sundae.
Thank you for bringing
your artistry
to the main stage
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race."
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
You look absolutely
beautiful tonight.
Of course, it‘s iconic Cher
for us,
so it makes us super happy.
-[as Cher]
-Snap out of it.
You have brought it,
<i>and this music video</i>
<i>was no exception.</i>
For avant-garde, I want you
to look like an alien,
<i>and that blue look</i>
<i>with the white boots</i>
<i>gave that to me.</i>
And what I love most about you
is you‘re so sweet.
You‘re that great
combination of, like,
you‘re a fierce bitch that could
cut a bitch on the street,
but you‘re also, like,
a sweet little, like, kitten.
I‘m so happy to see you here,
because I think
you bring something
really special and unique.
You listened, you worked,
and it paid off.
We all have those moments
when you decide to, like,
bust through.
I can think of times
in my career...
it was hearing "No"
when I just said,
"Fuck y‘all.
I‘m in,"
and there was just a moment here
when you just said, "I am in."
Naomi, to say that you
are the surprise...
it‘s no exaggeration.
It‘s just as surprising
as Chi Chi for me.
This is not the final four
that I would have predicted
the first week
in the competition,
and you did it,
and you earned it.
I want to say this
to all the girls.
The theme of the winner‘s circle
is adaptability,
but at the same time
staying true
to your own unique frequency,
and that‘s the truth
not only in this competition
but in everything in life.
Taking those cues
from the universe
and applying them
but without losing who you are,
and each of you represent that,
and I am so proud
of each of you,
and that is why you‘re standing
on this stage today.
All right, ladies.
Final question.
Why should you,
and not your competitors,
be crowned America‘s
next drag superstar?
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Bob The Drag Queen.
I have, statistically,
done the best
in this competition,
and you reward the person
who has done the best
with the highest reward.
I don‘t just do what I do
for me.
I literally do it
for anyone who can come
within range
of my obnoxious, raspy voice.
I serve the people.
I serve the community,
and more than just
doing stand-up comedy,
and actually getting
my hands and feet
into the dirt of the community
and helping it grow,
because the community
has helped me grow,
and it‘s made me who I am today.
Thank you.
All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.
I should be America‘s
next drag superstar
because I feel like I possess
the talent,
the willingness to grow,
the willingness to take
your critiques
and apply ‘em.
I can be funny just as well.
I can make costumes,
and I can beat this mug out too.
I can work a runway.
I can work a music video,
and I‘ve just blossomed,
and I feel like...
that I should be
America‘s next drag superstar,
because I‘ve shown
the most growth
out of--out of all
of these girls.
Thank you.
All right, next.
Kim Chi.
Throughout this
whole competition,
I have shown consistent
and creative and detailed looks.
I have been professional
and courteous
throughout this whole
experience.
I have been willing to adapt
to myself
in any situation I am in.
None of the girls will ever come
up with the stuff that I do.
I don‘t want to be America‘s
next drag superstar.
I am America‘s
next drag superstar.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
All right, Naomi Smalls.
I love drag so much.
It is what, like, gets me up
in the morning,
and I have such a need
and a want to grow,
and I don‘t like
to pigeonhole myself
into just being either
a stand-up comedian
or a dancing queen
or a look queen.
I want to be able to do anything
and show everybody
that I can be successful
just being me
and loving who I am,
and that is everything
I want in the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, my queens,
I think we‘ve heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Now, just between us
squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Now, y‘all were doing
a lot of praising up there,
and these kids have come
a long way.
I understand that,
but I need y‘all to get real
for the realness.
-You know what I‘m saying?
-I can get real.
-I‘ll break it down.
-You know?
‘Cause, hey, this is still
a competition,
and somebody
has to go home tonight.
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
Spandex leggings...
not so much for best drag.
I would have loved
to have seen a gown.
The makeup has always been
-not great.
-Right.
There was some growth
with the looks,
but, you know, if I‘m buying
a ticket to Bob‘s show,
it‘s not to see glamour.
It‘s to be entertained.
She‘s been consistently smart
with her humor.
-The Snatch Game was stellar.
-Oh.
I also liked
the shady politics ad.
I thought that was really funny.
I think my number one
Bob moment
was "chocolate chip cookie."
Shut it down in the acting.
Really every challenge,
Bob rose to the occasion
and was able to inject
Bob The Drag Queen
into that challenge.
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
Look at how far she‘s come.
She had to lip-sync
for her life twice,
and she not only saved herself,
she, like, killed it.
Like, we had
a "come to Jesus" meeting
during "I‘m Telling You
I‘m Not Going."
The Bitch Perfect challenge.
That was a high point.
She was upside down,
lip-syncing.
-Uh-huh.
-Twerking.
-Yes.
-I mean, come on.
<i>Also, the Book Ball</i>
<i>was a shining,</i>
glorious moment
for Chi Chi DeVayne.
<i>As great as she looked,</i>
looking at the four queens
on that stage today,
I didn‘t know
if she‘s as original
as the other ones, you know?
-Chi Chi I‘ve seen done before.
-Mm-hmm.
-But I‘m in love with Chi Chi.
-Right.
As a judge, I don‘t know
what to do with that.
She is one of the kids
who come from the sort of
backwoods of drag.
She doesn‘t have to do
the outfits
that people in big cities
come to expect,
but in this competition,
judges wanted to see more,
and she delivered more.
<i>Kim Chi.</i>
She can definitely
serve a look
better than nobody‘s business.
I loved the Wonderful
<i>-Wizard of Oz challenge.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>And what she did with the</i>
<i>stripes, with the little woman,</i>
I thought it was really,
really smart.
When she did the Book Ball
<i>and created the paper wig</i>
<i>out of pink pieces of paper,</i>
it‘s phenomenal.
My favorite moment
with Kim Chi
was the first time I saw her,
and I thought, "What in the hell
am I looking at?"
The interesting thing for me
was watching the struggle
of not loving
who she is in her skin.
I kind of went through
a very similar thing
when I did "Queer Eye."
It was like that thing
that I was hiding.
It was like, "Oh, my God,
you‘re the queer guy?"
Then it was, like, celebrated,
and you‘re like,
"Wait a minute."
I think that‘s gonna happen
with her owning it
and saying,
"Wait, I‘m being celebrated
for who I am,
lisp and awkwardness,"
and she will get there,
but does she have the ability
to command a stage
and work a crowd?
I don‘t know.
She has the capability
-to change drag a little.
-Mm-hmm.
-You know what I mean?
-Yes.
To really sort of shift it
in a very new,
-2000-something...
-Yes.
Sort of way,
and I‘m curious to see
where it goes.
<i>All right, let‘s move on</i>
<i>to Naomi Smalls.</i>
She has upped her game,
and she has brought it to us
on a different level.
The Wizard of Oz moment
<i>was such a game changer.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-My God.</i>
That was really
the turning point for her.
-I mean, haute couture.
-Yeah.
High-end fashion.
Now, in the video,
I really loved
-her avant-garde look.
-Mm-hmm.
<i>I love that she knows</i>
<i>her brand.</i>
I think the turning point
for me
was in the black-and-white movie
runway look,
<i>and she did that beautiful</i>
<i>gray makeup.</i>
And then out she comes
in the Book Ball
<i>in that paper dress,</i>
<i>which was straight off</i>
<i>of a runway somewhere.</i>
Her POV became OMG.
-[laughing]
-For me.
LOL.
She‘s one that
in a year or two
will be killing it,
but I think she‘s just
not there yet.
I don‘t believe that at all.
-Really?
-We can all get better.
But compared
to the other girls
at this point in time,
-I don‘t think she‘s there yet.
-I do.
Her drag is really good
and polished.
And she‘s fashion.
She‘s posing,
which gives me the chills
every time she does that thing
that I wish I could do,
but my belly gets in the way.
I--guess what I‘m about to say?
-I agree with Michelle.
-[exclaims]
-What?
-I know, I know.
I know, but I...
I think what she did this season
is worthy of being
in the top three
and maybe even taking the crown.
well, I‘ve just got to say
for the room, you know,
you guys have been
no help whatsoever.
[all laughing]
Silence!
I‘ve made my decision.
Bring back my girlssssssss...
<i>[dramatic notes]</i>

<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
This is the 100th episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
-[all] Yes!
-Whoo!
-Oh, my God.
-So I've arranged a photo shoot
with some extra
special guest stars.
[laughing]
Pose the house down.
You remind me of a dog trying
to get comfortable on the couch.
Oh, my God.
Each of you will be assigned
a legendary design challenge
<i>from a past season.</i>
[fabric rips]
[gasps]
My fucking
panties just ripped.
Shit.
Acid Betty.
Every inch was kind
of covered with a thought.
To me that's what drag is about.
Naysha Lopez.
I just don't think
it looks good.
I don't really sew.
Kim Chi.
You were giving me, like,
this Cowardly Lion
ferociousness.
I like that you kept
your areolas bald.
The breasts are the windows
to the soul for sure.
Laila McQueen.
I felt like the bottom half
was just a cop-out.
Do you think
that your missteps
would warrant you in the bottom?
I don't think that
I am the least put together.
Who do you think
is the least put together?
Naomi.
Her look is very plain.
Do you agree with that, Naomi?
No.
Kim Chi, condragulations.
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Yeah, girl.
Laila McQueen,
shantay, you stay.
Naysha Lopez, sashay away.
-Girl.
-Whoo.
Oh, my gosh.
Aww.
<i>-[Robbie] The first message</i>
<i>in lipstick on a mirror.</i>
Holy fuck.
Too real.
"It was a pleasure
meeting you all.
Play the cards you are..."
-[both] "Dealt
and turn da party."
-Aww.
-Cutie.
I'm sad to see her go.
She had such a nice butt.
I'm gonna miss my sister
a lot, so te amo, mamita.
<i>For me it's shocking</i>
<i>that Naysha</i>
left this competition
too sooner
<i>-[Cynthia] because I know</i>
<i>she can offer a lot more.</i>
I got to say,
when you hear the words
"lip-synch for your life"
in person,
-it's not fucking funny.
-It sucked.
Hearing the judges' critiques,
I definitely need to do more
to stand out.
Wipe her away, girl.
Shit's getting real.
Back at home I'm more of the,
like, edgier girl,
<i>-[Tyler] but, like, seeing</i>
<i>people like Thorgy, Acid Betty,</i>
<i>and Kim Chi,</i>
<i>it's like, "Okay,</i>
"I am no longer the big fish
in a small pond.
Bitch, you need to, like,
step it up."
So, Laila,
were you gagged
that I was not
in the bottom two?
I had to say something.
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I do not think</i>
that a lot of the girls
really deserved to be safe.
<i>Naomi's boat</i>
<i>looked like shit.</i>
<i>Cynthia's outfit</i>
<i>was a knockoff pink version</i>
<i>of Detox's from her season,</i>
<i>and Miss Derrick Barry--</i>
<i>girl, the first episode,</i>
a bikini, really?
It was so hard to read.
Between you, me, her,
and Naysha, I was like,
"I honestly have no idea
who they're gonna pick."
I don't blame Laila
for being salty
about being in the bottom two.
<i>-[Naomi] I think she's feeling</i>
<i>like she's really blending in.</i>
Everyone wants to meet the star,
not the entourage,
and right now
Laila's just giving entourage.

Oh, thank you.
Now, ladies, two of you were
the baddest bitches of all.
The winners are...
Cynthia Lee Fontaine...
[cheering]
And Chi Chi DeVayne.
[cheering]
Let's give a big "Drag Race"
thank you to AB Soto.
-[all] Whoo!
Now, cha cha, bitch.
Ladies, I'm glad
you're all warmed up
because this week's
maxi challenge
is an all dancing,
all lip-synching extravaganza.
-[all] Whoo!
<i>-[Kim] Choreography?</i>
Mm-mm.
You'll be competing
in two teams
in the dragappella movie
"Bitch Perfect."
[cheering]
#BitchPerfect, okay?
Plus you'll be meeting
with a choreographer
who's worked with Miley,
Madonna, and J. Lo, honey.
-The red hot Jamal Sims.
-Whoo!
Cynthia and Chi Chi,
you won the mini challenge,
so you are team captains.
Cynthia, your group
is the Lady Bitches,
the sweethearts of dragapella
from the prestigious
Lace Front Institute
of Technology, darling.
[laughter]
Chi Chi, your group
is Shady Bitches.
Y'all the bad girls
from the Lake Titicaca Academy
of Braids, Weaves,
and Waffles.
[laughter]
All right, ladies,
it's time to pick teams.
Cynthia, who will you
choose first?
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-All right, all right.
Chi Chi, you're next.
Acid Betty.
It don't get
shadier than this.
Derrick Barry.
Oh, thank God
I did not get picked last.
-Thorgy Thor.
-Whoo!
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yow.
-Laila.
-Laila.
[laughter]
Let's go with
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Yay, my turn.
Robbie.
That means that Kim Chi
and Naomi Smalls are left.
Sorry, Kim, but I'm gonna
have to go with Naomi.
Which of course means that
Kim Chi goes to Cynthia's team.
Wah.
<i>It's okay.</i>
I wouldn't want me either.
Ladies, this week
you've got to use
your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent
to chorally gratify
me and the judges.
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheering]
<i>-[Derrick] Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Kim Chi's a horrible dancer.</i>
She's so bad.
How is she gonna get
through this dance challenge?
So, girls, like,
we're gonna, like,
take one, pass it down.
The pressure of being
a team captain,
it--it can be a lot,
but I've done choreography
for the girls back at home.
I got this.
I think we should
get some choreography together.
Let's just worry about that
when in time comes.
Don't--don't confuse yourself.
We need to know
where you come in first.
I think after this
we should
put something
together just in case.
-Don't get scared.
-I'm not scared.
-I'm just trying to be prepared.
-I know, but--
I'm not gonna be unprepared
because of you, boo.
I can sense that Acid
definitely wants
to be the group leader,
but it ain't happening.
We need to learn
where we come in first.
Fine, but we got to
start doing something.
We can't just sit here
sitting here learning words.
<i>I've known Betty for,</i>
<i>like, ten years,</i>
and sometimes because Betty
is so artistic,
she gets away with
being a fucking asshole.
Let's go from the beginning.
"Oh, really,
is that all you got?
What about this?"
Is that what
you're gonna be doing?
"Lake, Lake,
Titi, Titi, Titi."
-Yeah.
-No, you're gonna be out there.
-But the rest--
-Whatever.
Well, we should probably
set it instead of "whatever."
Let's get beyond "whatever."
Okay.
<i>-[Thor] Acid Betty is an</i>
<i>asshole,</i>
<i>and she knows it,</i>
<i>and she loves it,</i>
and that's why she doesn't
work in New York.
<i>She's so demanding</i>
<i>and mean to everyone</i>
<i>that nobody wants</i>
<i>to work with her.</i>
You're gonna be shamed.
You're gonna be put down,
so, Chi Chi, good luck.
Formations, formations.
One, two, three, four.
I like that roll back
and sit in the hip.
-Yeah.
-That's cool.
This week's maxi challenge is
an a cappella lip-sync battle.
<i>-[Derrick] Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>we have to lip-synch.</i>
<i>We have to dance.</i>
Basically we're putting out
"Bitch Perfect."
Here we go, and pat,
pat, pat-pat-pat.
Let me see y'all do it.
-Boom, boom.
-Bam, bam, bam, bam.
Uh-uh, y'all look like
flailing fishes.
Well, "pat, pat,
pat-pat-pat,
"pat, pat, pat-pat-pat"
was the original rhythm.
No, ma'am.
It's pat, pat, pat-pat-pat,
pat, pat, pat-pat-pat.
Switch it
to something simpler.
That's so simple too.
I can't even get any simpler.
<i>-[Chi Chi] I picked my team</i>
<i>based off the mini challenge,</i>
but girl,
these girls cannot dance.
Boom, boom.
Wait, we're now--
we're robot-ing.
Okay, simple.
One, two, three, four,
turn and down, down.
It look crazy.
I'm just trying to fucking
get your visual in my head
so I can have it.
-Do it, bitch, do it.
-Three, four, five, six, seven.
-That's it.
-One, two, three, four, five.
No, five, six, seven,
eight is just a turn.
Don't move on five, six,
seven, eight at all.
We should change it if
you can't get it.
What the eff?
It's simple.
One, two, three, four, turn.
One, two,
three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
-Is that--
-Got it.
The hands weren't the same,
but fuck it.
We got to move on.
You ready?
♪ One shot, one shot
of adrenaline, adrenaline ♪
I don't know.
We're doing it.
It's happening.
All right, girl.
Can you just give me a shot,
and I'll flip out?
I'll do the second one.
And I'll punch you
in the face--boom!
See, you trying to get
out of the choreography.
-Bitch, you trying to do comedy.
-I can do all of it.
If we're standing there,
"One shot,"
five beats of silence,
it's boring.
I don't want you to do
that punch thing.
I just want you to, like--
Okay.
Chi Chi does not get funny,
<i>and I'm, like, a comedy queen,</i>
<i>so I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, you know what?</i>
I'm gonna do it anyway.
I don't care, bitch,
it'd be funny."
All right,
so shall we move on
and do it again,
or do you want to stand here?
We'll get it.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>These bitches getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>
They getting on my nerves now.
All right, Lady Bitches,
are you ready?
Kim, I feel like you're
the one who is kind of,
like, nerdy and not cool.
Yeah.
-Regina George.
-I'm the ringleader.
I think you should be,
like, her kid sister.
You do exactly
whatever she does,
just not as good
as she does it.
Aw, Laila's my impersonator.
-That's cute.
-Yeah.
My biggest concern
is that I'm gonna
fade into the background
comparatively
<i>to all the other girls,</i>
<i>so I'm not sure</i>
<i>about playing the,</i>
like, little sister, like,
wannabe Derrick Barry,
'cause I probably wouldn't be
the best Britney impersonator.
Look at this
giant fucking heel.
-Yeah.
-Those are so cute.
Bitch, I hope y'all can dance
in them high-ass heels.
You need something
this size, hon.
-That's like a--four inches.
-No, ma'am.
Have you ever, guys,
been in proper shows before
where you have to learn
choreography and stuff?
When I was a kid, yes.
Like, for years.
Just--oh,
when you were younger.
So you don't really
know how to, like,
just focus
and get it done?
Yeah, I do.
'Cause we're
talking about shoes.
I would love to,
like, save the time
and figure out
what we're doing.
This is how
the group's gonna down.
"So what'd you guys do?"
"Well, we spent time talking
about how comfortable
these shoes were."
-We're not going down.
-No.
My worry with this group
is that I might be the only
one that's gonna give it
and the other girls are just
gonna take me down with them.
<i>Chi Chi needs to step up</i>
<i>and get us together.</i>
So we all know our lip syncs
somewhat? Like, the words?
-Ish.
-Mm-hmm.
I think that's gonna be
the most important part
so when we meet the
choreographer
we can kind of just take
in what he's saying.
You're, like,
looking at me like
I'm Charlie Brown's teacher.
Wah, wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah.
Wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah.
-You're done?
-No, I'm not done.
Definitely not done.
I just want to be good.
My biggest fear
in this challenge
<i>is these girls flopping</i>
and me having
to take the fall
for my whole team.
Hey, kitty girls.
-Hey, Ru.
-[all] Hi!
How are my
little treble makers?
-We're working it out.
-Yeah.
-Cynthia Lee.
-Hi, RuPaul.
What's the name of your group?
My name
of my group is--
You've got to look at a paper
to get the name of your group?
-Lady Bitches.
-Yes, ma'am.
So what--
did you have a strategy
in choosing these ladies?
Actually, yes,
'cause I got dancers.
I got the comedians one,
the actors, makeup artists.
Now, Kim Chi,
this is a lip-sync challenge.
Are you a lip-sync artist?
I think I am,
but my biggest problem
is sometimes when I lip-synch
my lisp comes through.
-I'm not mad at a lisp.
-Yeah.
In fact,
I'm partial to a lisp.
My empire was built on a lisp.
-Really.
-Absolutely.
Are you familiar with
the movie "Pitch Perfect?"
I've never heard of it
or even know what it's about.
I was probably in Korea
at the time.
Well, it just came out, uh,
six months ago.
[laughter]
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
So now, Laila,
why do you think you wound up
in the bottom two?
Well,
the photo with Mathu
<i>was definitely</i>
<i>less than amazing.</i>
Right, because, you know,
you were scrunched over.
You weren't shining through.
How are you gonna shine through
in this challenge?
I ain't gonna
be squatting down
and sitting in the back.
I'm gonna come forward
and be present.
Well, you know,
a lot of girls say that.
There's more strategy
to it than that.
-You realize that?
-Yes, ma'am.
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>I need to bring myself up</i>
<i>to the level</i>
<i>of the other girls</i>
so I can be like,
"I'm here too."
It's not just them.
I am here.
Listen, I am
so excited for this,
and we're gonna see
the real crème de la crème
rise to the top, all right?
Oh, she's coming back?
She's coming back.
All right, get to work.
-Thank you.
-All right.
-Thanks, lady.
-Whoo.
Well, all right, now.
-Hey.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, Ru.
-Are y'all the Shady Bitches?
Yes, we are.
Are there any shady bitches
in this group?
Oh, okay, well,
there you have it.
Now, Chi Chi,
you from Louisiana.
Louisiana, baby.
You know, both my parents
are from Louisiana.
Yes, I enjoy being
a country queen.
I mean, who doesn't like
an old smoked turkey neck, baby?
[laughter]
Now, Chi Chi,
you're the leader.
How are you navigating all
of these strong personalities?
I'm finding them
a little bit difficult.
Really?
Are you for real?
I'm for real.
I've never had to deal
with such big personalities,
and back home I'm the star,
so to get this many
stars in one room?
It's just, like, girl.
Okay, well, is anybody
afraid of choreography?
No.
She didn't like my comedic
take of a punch in the face.
No, ma'am.
I'm always been,
like, putting in
my little comedic
chime in there,
but you're shutting it down,
so I'm probably
gonna do it anyway
regardless of
what Chi Chi says.
I prefer the whole thing
to be choreographed.
I feel safer,
and I think
I'm having a hard time
getting her to actually
put down the steps.
Maybe you should be
more of a tyrant.
I cannot be a tyrant.
That's not in my blood.
I think I'll give that part
to Acid Betty.
-Oh.
-Yeah.
Are you a tyrant,
Acid Betty?
No, I haven't showed
that side yet.
Girl.
She's the leader,
so I'm letting her
kind of make decisions.
All right,
get back to work,
and knock 'em dead.
-All right. Thanks.
-Thank you.
Let's get this work done.
All right, ladies,
gather round.
Now, if at any time
during this competition
you feel the need
to get something
off your chesticles--
yes, take advantage
of the Shade Tree.
-Uh-oh.
-Oh.
<i>Think of it as a diary room</i>
where you can say whatever
you want in total privacy.
-[all] Ooh.
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
-All right?
-[all] All right.
Hey, hey, hey,
Team Lady Bitches.
We're ladies,
and we're bitches.
My team are setting up
to met Jamal.
I'm so excited about that.
He's a sexy--mmm--
chocolate flavor.
[laughs]
[record scratches]
Did my teeths look yellow?
No.
Let me something
y'all put together.
We have, like,
a pose that we do,
which is, like,
a one, two, look pose.
♪ Who do you think you are? ♪
♪ We're all born naked
and the rest is drag ♪
We like to incorporate
our little move.
Uh-huh,
it's--I--I see it.
Jamal's
pretty much like,
"Oh, well, that's cute,
but no."
You guys are Lady Bitches,
and so I really want
to present you guys
dancing very up,
very, you know,
trained and very precise
and classic.
So let's start
from the top, yeah?
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Let me see you do it.
One, two, three, four,

Whoops.

It's profoundly difficult
to try and do all these steps

Kim Chi,

to keep doing it in heels?
-100%.
-Okay.
She need to nail this
because if she falls tomorrow
in front of the judges live,
we are completely done.
Shady Bitches in the house.
-[all] Hey.
<i>So we're working with</i>
<i>the fabulous Jamal Sims.</i>
<i>I'm ready for him to just</i>
<i>give us some structure</i>
to this dance routine
that I've come up with.
Show me what you got.
Well, what about this?

So you guys have
a lot of good ideas,

clean 'em up and make 'em...
-Together.
-Cohesive.
"Cohesive" is the word.
I'm so happy that we have
a little bit of choreography
like I suggested--
Chi Chi,
<i>because now we're with Jamal,</i>
and he's actually

-Ah!
-Oh, she's a diva.
It's about commitment.
Sweat flying, hair dripping,
whatever, it doesn't matter.
As long as you commit,
you're in it, okay?
How you feeling?
I mean, I'm shaky on it,
but I got to
go through it a few times
and I'll get it.
Like, that's how I work.
Like, I don't pick up
choreography super quick.
Like, if I think while
I'm dancing, I can't do it.
I get really in here,
and it just becomes
all fucked up, so...
Dax's attitude was
really off-putting to me
just because it didn't feel like
she really wanted to do it.
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of insecurity there</i>
when it comes
to the choreography.
You have to push yourself
on this one,
'cause we don't have
a lot of time.
Totally.
It means a lot
for me to be here,
<i>and I don't want to have</i>
<i>to go back to Savannah</i>
and find some shitty day job
picking up dog shit
or, you know, just doing random
sporadic shows in dive bars.
Like, I want to take
over the world,
<i>and I want to do it now,</i>
<i>and I want to do it with drag,</i>
so I will make it work.
I'm a little nervous,
I'm not gonna lie.
We didn't get
all the way through, so...
<i>So rehearsal is over,</i>
and the Lady Bitches are
in a little bit of trouble.
<i>Kim Chi seems a little too</i>
<i>in her head to pull this off,</i>
<i>and nobody's expecting her</i>
<i>to be the best</i>
<i>dancer in the room,</i>
but she's thinking that,
and that's
what's messing her up.
I remember the choreography,
but my only problem is hitting,
like, the points, like,
at the right time, so.
We can help you with that.
One thing we can't do
is teach you
that rhythm in a day.
Yeah.
But you can, like,
just live in your character,
and like,
if you're offbeat,
just be like--what happened?
'Cause then you're funny.
We're all, like,
rallying around.
We're like, "Kim Chi,
you can do this,"
but Kim Chi is being really,
like, down on herself.
I just really wish, like,
I could hit the beats.
They said last week
that they love
that you're a nerd.
You'll be fine.
[Kim Chi]<i> I am so nervous</i>
<i>about tomorrow.</i>
I really don't want
to let my group down.
Everyone has been
super, super helpful
guiding me through all of this.
<i>I'm not ready to go home yet.</i>
I have so many looks and ideas
that I want to showcase.
Man.
I'm just gonna try my best
and do what I always do.
Uh, uh-uh, uh.
Uh, uh-uh, and stop.
You all okay?
-You guys hot?
-Yes, very.
That means we're
putting in work.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, do you have
any paper towels?
-Y'all need to focus.
-What?
Y'all need to focus
on what y'all doing.
I think I'm doing
a good job, you know.
Yeah, do a good job
or you're gonna have to
lip-synch against me.
Why do you think you're
gonna be in the bottom?
'Cause I'm the team captain.
They're gonna say,
"The team captain
"should have had everybody
at her's--at her level."
Yes, but I'll be
the first person
to be like, "Mm, she did a
fucking good job as captain."
'Cause she gonna
throw me under the bus.
Fuck yeah,
I'll be honest as fuck.
-She was--
-What'd I do?
You were like, "At least
I can lip-synch for myself.
I know I was gonna be all that."
That's what you did.
But then I
pulled it back together.
She pulled
the team together, yeah.
You can say
that if they ask me.
Exactly.
Betty is being
so negative,
and, like, counterproductive,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God.
This is so stupid."
It is what it is.
Just hope you're not
lip-synching
against me, darling.
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to coddle this girl.</i>
We're both on this
competition together.
When that bus comes by,
I'm gonna throw her first.
I told her that too.
-Oh.
-Shady Bitches.
Ooh, we're gonna kill
the Shady Ladies.
Oh, my goodness.
Time to get styling.
<i>Today's elimination day.</i>
<i>This the first time we're</i>
<i>performing for the judges.</i>
I'm very nervous.
How did your group's
rehearsal go?
It went well.
I was nervous
as fuck at first,
but I have to understand
that everybody's not a dancer,
and everybody's not gonna
catch on as fast as me,
so I can't be
frustrated about it.
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah.
This challenge--when I first
got it, I'm like, "Oh, my God.
This is, like,
my biggest nightmare."
Everybody's not
a born dancer.
Yeah.
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I was definitely an outsider.</i>
The weird, fat art kid
<i>who had a strong lisp</i>
<i>and a strong accent,</i>
<i>and that's why</i>
<i>I just really never learned</i>
<i>how to dance</i>
<i>and never learned how to,</i>
like, feel the music.
I used to be 350 pounds.
-350?
-Jesus.
Yeah.
-Until about 3 1/2 years ago.
-[both] Wow.
Obviously, like, I'm not
as fat as I was before,
but the fat kid is,
like, still in me.
Yeah, no,
it never goes away, girl.
Come on, proof.
This is me fat.
-Oh, queen.
-Oh, my God.
Girl, you look
completely different.
I was chubby too.
I was always aware it,
like, when I was kid, like,
'cause other kids
made it very apparent like,
"Mm, reminding you.
Not only are you super gay,
but you're also chubby."
<i>When I was an overweight kid,</i>
<i>being ridiculed</i>
<i>and made fun of,</i>
<i>I wanted to have that poise</i>
<i>and that confidence</i>
<i>and that power,</i>
and now finally with drag
I can do that.
That's how it was.
Like, when you're fat,
people just, like,
just don't treat you like--
-Like a person?
-Yeah.
Like taking public transit,
people never sit next to you.
Really, you notice
things like that?
All the time.
<i>Because of those experiences,</i>
<i>I'm still learning</i>
how to be confident in myself
and how to be comfortable
in my own skin,
<i>but just like all the other</i>
<i>things I'm doing here,</i>
<i>I want to commit to it</i>
<i>and become better.</i>
Did people start hitting on
you when you lost the weight?
I'm still a virgin, so no.
-What?
-What?
I was totally coming onto you
when I met you that one time.
Maybe people
are hitting on you
and you literally
have no clue.
Is that a possibility?
-Not really; I don't know.
-Yes, yes.
I think so.
Acid said she was
hitting on you and you--
I was, hard too.
I just thought
you were being friendly.
I'm gagging.
Hopefully someone
sees the beauty in me
one of these days.
<i>I don't think Kim Chi knows</i>
<i>what she looks like.</i>
<i>She's still a virgin</i>
<i>because she's not aware</i>
that she's, like,
a good-looking 6'4" man.
You got to own that.
-So, Cynthia.
-Uh-huh?
What was it
like in Puerto Rico?
Oh, amazing.
They got a lot of gangs
in Puerto Rico too.
Yes.
When I was
younger, girl,
I wanted to be in a gang.
Girl, I had a gun,
a .38 Special.
-What?
-Yes, God.
I was a little gangbanger.
Girl, I've seen people shot.
Oh, my God.
I've smelled, like,
the smell of brains.
Chi Chi, that is insane.
Girl, to see my mom
break down and cry?
That was it.
Plus my daddy beat the hell
out of me for having a gun.
-Good parenting.
-Yeah.
I can't even imagine.
When I tell you
I come from the streets,
I'm not kidding.
People don't make it
where I come from.
Were you doing
all of that
with gangs and everything
'cause you were trying
to hide the fact
that you were gay?
Yeah,
'cause I was afraid
of what my mom,
my brother, you know,
everybody would think of me.
<i>When I look back,</i>
<i>I can kind of see</i>
<i>why I was acting out.</i>
It was because
I wasn't being me.
<i>When I finally came out,</i>
it was a turning point
in my life.
I could have been dead.
I could have been locked up,
but I'm here with you girls.
I feel blessed,
bitch, to be here.
And you're a role model,
an example
for the future generations.
So, so proud of you, baby.
Baby, I overcame it.
-All right.
-Okay.
Can I get an amen?
-[all] Amen.
-[speaking Spanish]
-What?
What does that mean?
"If you can't love yourself,
how the hell you can
love somebody else?"
I will never read
another queen on TV again.
I know, bitch,
no, ma'am.
Who does she think she is?
Blahbedy-blah-blah-blah.
Hasn't she ever heard
of a lace front?
Blippity, bloppity, bloopity.
If I was on
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"
I tell you what I would do.
Ain't that
the truth, right?
I would do this,
and I'd never do that.
Cut, too, girl.

"RuPaul's Drag Race"
Fashion Week
presents Naomi Smalls.
-Come on, baby.
-Ooh, yes.
<i>I know that the judges</i>
<i>are admiring me</i>
<i>from every angle.</i>
<i>The hair is right.</i>
<i>The legs are right.</i>
<i>The shoes are right.</i>
<i>The face is right.</i>
<i>Everything's right.</i>
<i>I just made</i>
<i>the best dressed list.</i>
Serving legs,
necks, arms, thighs.
Cover girl.
Acid Betty.
Oh, architecture.
She is giving 1970s
Pat Cleveland on the runway.
-Yes.
-You know what, Ru?
-Huh?
-She don't fool me.
-I see right through her.
-[laughter]
<i>I've chosen to wear</i>
<i>this skin color gown</i>
<i>and, of course, my fierce</i>
<i>Philip Treacy wannabe hat.</i>
<i>This outfit is couture</i>
<i>made just for me,</i>
<i>and no other bitch</i>
<i>will have one.</i>
Is that a new telephone?
-Bluetooth.
-This is the 5G network.
[laughter]
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Southern belle.
Come on, Lonette McKee.
"Cotton Club."
-Can I borrow a cup of flour?
-She's all out.
[laughter]
<i>Tonight on the runway</i>
<i>I'm serving</i>
<i>lady sings</i>
<i>the green and gold blues.</i>
<i>I'm not a gown girl,</i>
<i>but I really want to show</i>
<i>that I have clothes</i>
<i>that can touch the floor,</i>
<i>and I want to show them</i>
<i>a different silhouette</i>
<i>than I normally would wear.</i>
Yes, bang, bang
into the room.
Thorgy Thor.
-She doing the neutron dance.
-Oh, yeah.
Thorgy Minnelli.
<i>Whoo, it's disco, bitch.</i>
<i>I decided to not wear</i>
<i>what everyone else is wearing,</i>
<i>which was a boring gown.</i>
<i>I'm wearing my big</i>
<i>Donna Summer hair</i>
<i>and my sequin jumpsuit</i>
<i>that I made from scratch.</i>
<i>I'm comfy,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>
"Xanadu."
I want to dance
with your somebody.
She's the drag daughter
of a "Solid Gold" dancer.
Welcome, ladies.
Now, this week
you performed in teams,
but tonight you'll be
judged as individuals.
Harshly.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Laila McQueen.
Thorgy Thor.
Kim Chi.
Acid Betty.
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ladies,
you represent the tops
and the bottoms
of the week,
and the rest of you bitches
in the background...
are safe.
You may leave the stage.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Ladies,
you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up,
Laila McQueen.
Hello, Laila,
I think the dress is pretty.
The problem is,
you're lost in it.
The hair is flat and long.
Everything's being pulled down.
You can see none of you.
And as far as
the performance goes,
I feel like I wasn't getting
much of the comedy,
especially with the big
personalities around you.
Up next, Kim Chi.
I can tell
that you cannot dance,
but on the positive side
of that, you chose a character
to cover up
that you can't dance,
and it worked.
I don't mind
that you can't dance
because this look
is, like, fantastic.
-Yeah, I just want to smell you.
-Mmm.
I do get concerned
about your walk.
I'm not sure anymore
that it's a choice.
It's very stiff, darling.
Give yourself over to it.
Allow yourself to have fun
on this runway.
How do you say
"sissy that walk" in Korean?
-[speaking Korean]
-[speaking Korean]
-Pow, pow.
-Yes, yes, yes.
[speaking Korean]
Up next, Louisiana glamour.
Bayou country.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hey, y'all.
-[laughs]
It's funny 'cause
we shot "Pitch Perfect"
in Baton Rouge,
so you make me feel really good
by hearing your voice.
Your performance today,
you turned it completely out.
That got them ass clap.
You know, they'd be
throwing some dollars
at your ass real fast.
You definitely are
my new trap queen.
So tonight,
I think you look--
for lack of a better term,
sort of basic.
Look around.
This is a crew that came
to play this season.
But she looks amazing.
I love the red dress.
"Dreamgirls"
is one of my favorite musicals,
so right now you're giving me
Sheryl Lee Ralph realness.
I don't really have anything
negative to say about you.
Thank you.
[laughter]
Next up, Acid Betty.
What I really loved
about what you did is,
you were really a team player.
You were concerned
about everybody else,
and I appreciate stuff like that
because it lets
me know you care.
So I love the headpiece.
I love the body art.
I'm not getting the train.
I just like looking
at you right now.
I like looking
at you right now.
-Ha-ha!
-Do you need this?
You can't see
this right now,
but he's got a fistful
of Jergens lotion.
[laughter]
The one thing I'm
concerned about with you is,
you're setting the bar so high.
I'll be waiting to see
if you can keep raising it
'cause when you'll fall,
you'll fall hard.
Is that a challenge,
Michelle?
It's always a challenge when
I throw it out there, darling.
Next up,
Dax ExclamationPoint.
I love your face.
I love the hair.
Something about the bottom
of the dress is not done.
One thing I did notice
from last week.
I have an issue
with your padding.
It almost gives you
a quadru-butt.
Just look at it.
The performance,
I really wanted you
to get that hood,
like, uh, you know,
and it--and it still never came,
and in rehearsals
you were saying,
"Oh, yeah, I'll do it when
I figure out these steps."
I am not a classically
trained dancer in the least,
and like, I was also trying
to kind of create a character
while also thinking too much
about other stuff, and like--
You just got to go.
Whether you do it wrong
or whatever, commit.
All right,
Thorgy Thor.
As far as
the dance portion,
you're one of the people
I didn't have to worry about.
What I love about
the jumpsuit is,
it's smart because
you said, "You know what?
"At a movie premiere,
everybody else
"is gonna do
some glamorous gown.
I'm gonna do something
that's representative of me,"
But you wear your eyes so black
that I'm losing your eyeballs,
so blend it out.
I'll take that challenge, yes.
Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you
untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us altos,
what do you think?
<i>Laila McQueen.</i>
She stood out to me because
she was the most improved.
I would have never thought
she could last through
the whole performance.
But I didn't really
remember what she had done.
The only thing
I remember about her
is the mole
underneath her eye,
so I don't think that's good.
You know what this is?
This season has
very strong personalities.
She's out of her league.
I know she has a fire in her,
but she gonna have
to step her pussy up.
-Oh.
-Kim Chi.
Talk about somebody who's
the polar opposite of Laila.
You can't stop
looking at Kim Chi.
When I see her on the runway,
I was blown away,
<i>but it's so weird to me</i>
<i>that she can't walk in heels.</i>
It could become a trend.
New York Fashion Week,
a sasquatch, a Godzilla.
You better Kim Chi
that walk, girl.
Yes.
But my fear for Kim Chi
is that she is a look.
Because she's had such success
with who she is visually,
<i>she hasn't had</i>
<i>to deliver a performance.</i>
She just had to be really cute
and kind of nerdy and anime-y,
but I think there's
a personality in there.
I just want her to unleash it
and let us have it.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Tonight on the stage,
did she play it safe?
-Yes.
-I loved her outfit.
It just seemed
very classic and beautiful,
and as far
as the performance goes,
she really slayed
the other girls.
-I mean, really.
-Yes.
She was doing
her neck ghetto style
upside down while twerking
and not missing a word.
Honey, I was ready to make
the Louisiana Purchase
one more time.
[laughter]
Acid Betty.
Energy-wise,
a complete standout.
I particularly loved
her runway look
<i>with that weird</i>
<i>fiber optic spiderweb.</i>
-Yes.
-Everything I love about drag.
Look, it wasn't perfect.
There was weirdness at the back
that looked like draperies
being dry-cleaned.
I would have liked
if that dress just
did the see-through thing
all the way down
because it made
her bottom heavy,
and the color's ugly.
-Sorry.
-Sorry 'bout it.
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Tonight on the runway,
it just was all wrong for me.
The flower did not go
with the dress.
The colors were dull,
and in the performance
you literally forgot
that Dax was there.
In "Pitch Perfect,"
I know what it felt like
to not be a classical dancer.
It just takes courage
to get past it.
She don't want to fight for it.
It's like she's the girl
in the girl group
with the Beyoncé in it.
Beyoncé only stands out
because she really wants it.
-She's the Farrah.
-LaTavia.
I don't want
to call no names.
Thorgy Thor.
She nailed the performance.
She came out in that catsuit.
It was 180 degrees different
from the performance
personality.
-Just hated the shoes.
-Uh-huh.
They look like ugly shoes.
-Well, no,
-My issue is her makeup.
Two times in a row
it's a--two black eyes.
So, Michelle,
what you're saying is that
Thorgy is in an abusive
relationship with her makeup.
Yes.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Based on your
"Bitch Perfect" performance
and your movie
premiere eleganza,
I've made some decisions.
Thorgy Thor, you're safe.
Thank you.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
not only did
you turn it out,
girl,
you turned it upside down.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
-Wow.
-Wow.
-For real?
-Really, Ru?
Chi Chi sucked as a leader.
<i>I won a challenge.</i>
<i>I'm definitely on the radar.</i>
Y'all girls better look out.
You've won
a four-night getaway
to an all gay
bed and breakfast
in beautiful New England
courtesy of MyGayGetaway.com.
So I get to go overseas?
No, New England is here
in the United States.
-Oh, okay.
-[laughter]
Chi Chi,
you may cross the seas
-and join the other girls.
-Whoo!
Acid Betty,
you're safe.
Thank you.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
the lack of commitment
to your performance
forces me to put a question mark
after your name.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>I think there were girls</i>
<i>that did worse than me,</i>
and I'm sad,
and I'm just pissed about it.
Laila McQueen,
in your performance
you got lost
in the din and tonic.
Kim Chi, in your performance
you put your left foot forward.
Both of them.
Laila McQueen,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are
up for elimination.
Kim Chi,
you are safe,
and you may join
the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight
you were asked
to prepare
a lip-sync performance
of "I Will Survive"
by Gloria Gaynor.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip-synch
for your life.
[echoes]
<i>I don't really do disco.</i>
<i>It's just not my genre,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty confident</i>
I can definitely beat,
uh, Laila.
Sorry, I forgot her name
for a second.
<i>I feel the song</i>
<i>that we're doing</i>
<i>has such strong emotion</i>
<i>tied with it,</i>
and Dax is kind of lackluster,
and the song is not lackluster,
<i>so I'm like,</i>
<i>"You got this."</i>
All right, here we go.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Uh...
<i>Derrick‘s playing</i>
<i>this militant lesbian.</i>
Really?
"Chocolate Chip Cookie,

She‘s got major attitude
and blingy style."
I will feel comfortable
with Chocolate Chip Cookie,

There‘s a lot of words
in this.
Did you look at the script?
That‘s right,
Chocolate Chip Cookie‘s back!
I did not understand at all
what you said.

to win back Rucious for good!
Why are you talking up here
like that?
<i>Think the other team</i>
<i>should be worried</i>
because they have a lot of girls

not black.
"You double-crossing bitches."
<i>For today‘s challenge,</i>
we have to perform in scenes
inspired by the show, "Empire."
<i>It‘s got drama.</i>
<i>It‘s got Cookie.</i>
I mean,
this is a dream come true.
"Maybe it was a lil‘
somethin‘-somethin‘ extra
I put in the drink."
[laughs]
<i>-(Naomi)I‘ve never seen</i>
<i>"Empire," but Cookie sounds</i>
<i>like a handful.</i>

so it‘s just a match
made in heaven.
One thing I would say,
make it, like a
"Or maybe..."
-Let‘s do it again.
-‘Cause it got lost.
Robbie,
she‘s a trained actress
and she‘s giving us
all these tips.
Like, this whole thing,
and then be like,
"Stand back, bitches!"

We‘re definitely
gonna win this challenge.
"What you want?
Oh, hello, Rucious‘s doctor."
It‘s Rucious‘s doctor.
This is one stale-ass
Chocolate Chip Cookie.
Just an observation
that I‘m just making,
Thorgy and Kim Chi switch.
-I would love to.
-Yeah, super diva.
This is gonna be so good.
I really want to do this.
"Oh, you better think again,
RuRu kitty.
That‘s right;
Chocolate Chip Cookie is back."
"Did I hear my name?"
It sounded
like Bob was doing...
-Of course.
-Yeah.
We‘re gonna be up
against each other.
What part did you pick, Bob?
Chocolate Chip Cookie.
Of course
both myself and Bob
are playing
Chocolate Chip Cookie parts,

but I‘m like,
"I am not worried about that."

<i>gets kicked off to come back,</i>
so I was glad to beat
the shit out of her
with this dirty broom.
[laughter]
The White party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,
it‘s okay to be gay.
Cut.
Derrick, I‘m losing you
in that moment.
I know--you‘re not sort of
connecting with anyone.
Just make sure
that you command the room.
Okay.
The White Party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,
that it‘s okay...
[cries]
It‘s okay to be gay.
What the hell
is Derrick doing?
<i>She‘s lost in an afro.</i>
<i>She‘s not funny.</i>
Come on, Britney.
Step it up.
Team Naomi.
My co-director,
Faith Evans is here.
Hi, ladies.
This Notorious B.I.G.‘s wife.
<i>I got my drag name</i>
<i>from Biggie Smalls,</i>
so I‘m fucking freaking out.
Now, she has lived this life,
so if you have
any questions for her
in terms of character
or inspiration...
What‘s the best hand
to slap a hoe with,
like, the left or the right?
Well, I‘m left-handed.
[laughter]
All right, so places,
people, places.
Action.
Now where the hell is Rucious?
Rucious!
Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin‘.
Well, then why
did I waste my time
puttin‘ on this.
[cheers and laughter]
Why you all gaggin‘?
I bring it to you every episode.
-[laughing]
-Cut.
<i>You say this is</i>
<i>an over-acting challenge,</i>
I‘m like,
[puffs].
You ain‘t gotta tell me twice.
Action.
♪ Yo, yo, yo,
hallelu, hallelu ♪
♪ My name‘s Shortbread,
that‘s my girl, Macaroon ♪
[laughing]
And that‘s why they need
a strong woman on this company.
Cut.
Miss Cynthia Lee, you just
left out the word "gay,"
when you said this company needs
a strong, gay woman.
Yes, because that‘s...
that‘s the joke.
Okay, let‘s try that again.
This company need
a gay, strong woman.
Wait, cut.
The line is,
"A strong, gay woman."
I‘m a strong, gay woman!
<i>Cynthia‘s Ginger Snap</i>
<i>is hilarious</i>
for all the wrong reasons.
I don‘t even know if she knows
what she‘s saying.
[whistles]
All right.
Let‘s move on.
That and how to shoplift.
Empty your pockets,
please, ma‘am.
Fuck, line.
Robbie, differentiate
those voices,
so that we know
it‘s two different people.
Do want it, like,
satanic or something?
[clears throat]
-Just make them different.
-Okay.
That and how to shoplift.
[stammering]
Please, sir, empty your...
[high pitched] Please ma‘am,
will you empty your pocketbook?
Ah!
Robbie is really
screwing it up.
<i>You‘re the one</i>
<i>I was most confident in.</i>
We‘re gonna have
to work with what we have.
We could end up losing this
because of Robbie‘s mistakes.
For the first time
in drag herstory,
the girls are gonna do
a runway in roller skates.
<i>♪ ♪</i>
So anybody nervous
about skating?
-I‘ve never skated before.
-Really?
Ever.
So since I can‘t skate,
I have this idea,
like, maybe I can, like,
turn into a car
to, like, mask it.
Do you have, like,
wheels for your arms and stuff?
Oh, I have to make
my wheels, so.
-You have to make wheels.
-Yeah.
So he plans on falling
and what,
crawling across the stage
like a Transformer?
This is a mess
I can‘t wait to see.
How you feelin‘, Robbie?
I feel...actually...
better.
Girl, I‘m the disco rockin‘ diva
of the roller rink.
And my hope is that
my runway look redeems me
from that horrible performance
in the acting challenge.
I‘m actually wearing my mom‘s
vintage sunglasses,
which I‘m really excited about.
My parents
were straight-up hippies.
I would love,
love to meet your parents.
My mom, uh, passed away
when I was 19.
-What happened?
-She had cancer.
I was in college,
like, having a blast,
and, like, I would always call
and be like,
"How‘s everything?"
It was always fine.
But it wasn‘t.
And I finally got a call
from my dad being like,
"You know, you should probably
really come home."
When I went home, I mean,
she was not the--
She was not a person.
She...
She wasn‘t there.
I wish they were just a little
bit more honest with me,
‘cause when I got home,
she died that day.
Oh, my God.
She was a skeleton
in a hospital bed.
<i>-(Thor)I didn‘t really get a</i>
<i>good-bye.</i>
<i>And I kinda feel like</i>
<i>that was taken from me.</i>
And I‘m very angry about it,
but I don‘t know
where to put that anger.
It comes out of love for my dad,
he‘s like,
"I just don‘t want to, like,
interrupt your life and ruin...
Like, I want better things
for you."
And I‘m like, I get that...
"My parents wanted
to protect me."
But things like that, like...
I didn‘t get to say
good-bye to her.
She didn‘t want
to make my dad and my sister
feel, like, terrible,
but...
How come they didn‘t, like,
tell me to come home?
I will never forget that day.
I guess that‘s why
I talk about things so much.
Just get it over with.
That‘s a great idea.
Keep doing that.

please roll forward.
Naomi Smalls.
Kim Chi.
Naysha Lopez.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ladies, you are safe.
You may leave the stage.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
The rest of you
represent the high rollers
and the low rollers
of the week.
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.
Starting with Thorgy Thor.
Your roller girl look
You‘re giving me ‘70s.
You had the big blonde ‘fro.
-Not the most wildly inventive.
- Okay.
Now I‘m gonna go
to your performance,
which was so good.
Your delivery, your choreography
was meticulously done.
Yes!
[laughs]
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.
Next up, Derrick Barry.
I like this whole, like,
Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry
kind of thing.
You are doing a great job
with trying
to give us something
other than Brittney.
But I feel like
you‘re coming out
and these clothes
are wearing you.
With your performance,
the personality of the character
didn‘t really connect.
It was too laid back.
I‘d love to see you show me
that you do have soul.
So what you need to get to work
on is giving us your soul.
[chuckles]
Thank you very much.
Next up, Acid Betty.
Your performance,
I felt like you gave me
the "Sybil" multiple personality
with a little bit
of Carol Burnett goin‘ on.
I think you were very
convincing as a schizo.
This look tonight,
it‘s getting kinda predictable.
I‘d love to see something
way different.
-Another challenge, Michelle.
-I fucking love challenges.
Be you but don‘t be you.
Give us less but more.
[laughter]
All right, next up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
I love this look.
You did this Glamazon girl
from "Tron."
Tin Man, I have to say,
needs some lubricant.
[laughs]
Now let‘s get
to the performance.
<i>-(Michelle)Everything about it</i>
<i>was on point.</i>
<i>That adlibs were</i>
<i>really, really good.</i>
Taraji is going to die.
Lee Daniels is going to die.
Next up,
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Cynthia.
You have a great body with
a shirt that‘s like a formal
with a formal necklace
and formal earrings,
then you have, like, Hooters
shorts that don‘t fit at all.
It‘s so discombobulated.
The "Empire" scene, I don‘t
know what you were saying,
but I didn‘t care.
There were some nuances
that were missed.
What did you think,
watching yourself in the scene?
I love it.
-[laughs]
-It was really good.
It was really good.
[laughter]
Thank you very much.
All right, next,
Robbie Turner.
I do love the jumpsuit.
But what‘s bothering me
is all the silver accoutrements
and then a gold necklace.
I would lose the necklace.
Um, when we were workin‘
on that scene,
Ru was directing you
to kinda get into
the two different voices.
I don‘t think
you stuck with that.
It was kinda like I
didn‘t have a moment to, like,
break
and think of your notes
before we moved on
to another note
and also remember where
the blocking for the camera was
because I can‘t see very far.
When we originally read it,
I was Vanilla Wafer.
And it--we did change it.
Did that hurt you, you think?
I think it did hurt me,
and I didn‘t speak up
even though I was feeling it,
and so for the betterment
of the team, I was like...
You can‘t allow yourself
to be a victim
and use the excuse of,
"I was being nice."
It‘s a competition.
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we‘ve heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
<i>[car engine starting]</i>
All right, now just
between us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>
Her Chocolate Chip Cookie
killed it.
It‘s safe to say that,
uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie
was baked in a lovin‘ oven.
together: Mm-hmm.
It brings all the boys
to the yard.
Yeah!
[laughs]
That‘s the milkshake.
-Oh.
-[laughs]
<i>Derrick Barry.</i>
She goes from Britney Spears
to Katy Perry.
I‘m still waiting
to find Derrick Barry.
I thought the runway
was really cute.
But in the scene,
Ginger Snap got lost to me.
I‘ve seen her perform
as Britney Spears.
She puts her whole self into it,
and that‘s what she
needed to do in this challenge.
<i>Acid Betty.</i>
I think she did look
like a roller warrior,
<i>but I could probably</i>
<i>do without the Mohawk.</i>
In this role,
she looks like
she‘s one french fry short
of a Happy Meal straight away.
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
It‘s not easy to improv,
but also stay focused
on the scene.
I am feelin‘ her swag.
She has charisma and it allows
her to sell absolutely anything.
This Tron jumpsuit
is so basic,
and I found myself goin‘,
"Oh, my God, I love it so much."
[laughter]
This is great.
<i>Cynthia Lee Fontaine.</i>
Bless her cotton socks
with that runway outfit.
-Oh! Oh!
-They were Fruit of the Loom.
I just felt like she didn‘t
commit to the role that she had,
as sweet as she is,
but what‘s sweet
got to do with it?
All right, Ike Turner.
Yes.
<i>Robbie Turner.</i>
You had given
a lot of direction,
but Robbie
did not really get it.
But I love that jumpsuit.
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.
I love it.
Silence!
I‘ve made my decision.
Bring back my roller girls.
Thorgy Thor.
You‘re safe.
Bob The Drag Queen.
Condragulations, you‘re the
winner of this week‘s challenge.
-Whoo!
-Thank you!
<i>You‘ve one $3,500</i>
<i>of innovative eyewear</i>
<i>from Bradley Kenneth.</i>
Wow!
Ah!
<i>Now all the other girls</i>
<i>can see what I can do.</i>
I feel like everyone knows
I‘m a girl to beat.
Acid Betty.
-You‘re safe.
-Thank you, Mama.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
your Ginger Snap was loca,
but the judges were not crazy
about your roller girl.
I‘m sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
<i>[dramatic percussive tones]</i>
Robbie Turner,
your Macaroon
was not coconut-y enough.
Derrick Barry,
your Ginger Snap
did not snap, crackle, or pop.
Robbie Turner, I‘m sorry,
my dear,
but you are up for
elimination.
Derrick Barry,
you are safe, but...
you better work, bitch.
[chuckles]
Cynthia Lee,
Robbie,
now it‘s your choice.
Do you want to lip sync
in heels or wheels?
Heels.
Wheels.
Ooh.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you are asked to prepare
a lip sync performance
of "Mesmerized"
by Faith Evans.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
The time has come...

how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a Amen up here?

I'm a man in a dress.
Halleloo, ladies.
Drag is not a contact sport.
<i>-We're Heathers.</i>
<i>-Who the fuck is Heather?</i>
Get those nuts
away from my face.
Go back to Party City
where you belong.
Tootsie Lou.
Hi!
Hi, kids!
[clicks tongue]
<i>C'mon season six,</i>
<i>let's get sickening!</i>
<i>-Party.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>
Not today, Satan.
Do you have a smoke?
Can't tease me.
<i>I love my babies.</i>
I'm first!
[RuPaul]<i> Bring back my girls.</i>
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>
I am Naomi Smalls
and I am 21 years old.
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.
Naomi is a tall glass of water.
She has legs all the way up
to her asshole.
I got my drag name
from Naomi Campbell
and Biggie Smalls.
First one,
I don't blame them.
I'm obsessed
with '90s supermodels.
I'm gonna set myself
right in the center.
Yeah, spotlight on me.
[laughs]
Naomi is a fashion girl.
She's fucking fierce.
<i>[upbeat percussive music]</i>
How you doing mis amores?
Do you want to see my cuckoo?
[laughs]
My name
is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
How are you?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but
I live in Austin, Texas, y'all.
I call myself between
pageant queen and performer
'cause I do comedy,
I do campy sometimes.
Sometimes?
You know.
[laughs]
I'm sexy as a goddess is
and funny as a clown.
Are you ready for me?
Oh, my God,
the room is huge.
Fantastic,
so my cuckoo have a space.
I need a space
for this junk in the trunk.
[thunder rumbling]
What's up, nerds.
Ah!
<i>My name is</i>
<i>Dax ExclamationPoint</i>
and I am the queen
of all nerds.
It's Storm.
<i>I'm a cosplayer and my look</i>
<i>is very inspired by,</i>
<i>like, science fiction</i>
<i>and comics.</i>
Superheroes.
Just strong, bad bitches
who don't take any crap
from anybody else.
You know what?
I'm gonna sit
'cause my cats are growling.
So I'm just gonna sit
right here.
Okay.
Can I get some brunch?
[laughs]
Hola.
The beauty is here.
<i>My name is Naysha Lopez.</i>
I think the most important
element of my drag
has to be appearance.
<i>It sounds so shallow,</i>
<i>but my drag is flawless.</i>
It's gorgeous, it's stunning,
it's gorgeous, it's everything.
Did I say it was stunning
and gorgeous?
Did I say that already?
Okay.
[both scream]
Naysha is here!
Yes, my sister!
How are you, Mama?
Welcome to season eight,
Mommy.
We made it!
Continental sisters.
She Puerto Rico also,
or from Austin?
I'm originally
from Puerto Rico,
but, um, I live in Chicago.
[whistling]
That's a little frog
in Puerto Rico.
They are so annoying.
<i>I love me some Cynthia.</i>
<i>[whistles]</i>
You don't even understand
what she's saying,
but you don't really care.
[whistles]
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
-Oh!
-Oh!
No need to adjust
your TV sets.
This acid trip is all real.
[cheers]
Watch out bitches.
Here's Acid Betty
from Brooklyn, New York.
<i>My drag style is completely</i>
<i>over-the-top.</i>
Basically, a drug trip
without the drugs.
I kind of want to run around.
[laughs]
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she's a bitch.
That's it.
Even Bianca
won't fuck with her.
That's the T.
Wait, I want to put my stink
all over this place.
I'm excited to be here.
Come on, like,
before we all hate each other.
[laughter]
<i>[percussive music]</i>
Good morning.
I didn't realize
this was happening today.
<i>My name is Robbie Turner</i>
and I'm the kindest queen
you'll ever meet.
<i>I'm trying to give</i>
<i>old classic Hollywood.</i>
<i>Rita Hayworth hair,</i>
<i>Jean Harlow robe.</i>
Gorgeous.
How long you been
doing drag for?
Going on 14.
14 years of drag?
I know, can you imagine?
I'm only 12.
You don't look old.
I know I don't.
<i>[futuristic music]</i>
-Yes!
-Oh!
-Yay!
-Oh, Kim Chi!
I came to chop
through the competition.
My name is Kim Chi and
I came here to destroy everyone.
With my makeup.
<i>I'm known for crazy,</i>
over-the-top,
pure anime fantasy.
-Oh, my God.
-[cheering]
Hi, I'm Naomi.
This is beautiful.
<i>Seeing Kim Chi on Instagram</i>
for so long,
double-tapping everything,
I'm fucking star-struck.
I want to go subtle
with everything, so.
<i>I may come across as shy</i>
<i>because I'm soft-spoken,</i>
but "donut" come for me
because I'll destroy you.
Get it, donut?
[laughing]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Whoo!
Thorgy with a TH and orgy
and I feel incredible.
My name is Thorgy
and I'm 29 years old.
I'm not 29 years old.
Where did that come from?
I'm colorful, I'm fun,
and I'm a fashion clown.
Whoo!
O-M-baby Jesus.
<i>My drag style</i>
<i>is kind of incredibly eclectic.</i>
<i>I can be campy,</i>
but also I can be,
like, fucking fierce.
[cheers and applause]
-Hi, guys!
-Fuck you, Thorgy.
<i>I know Acid Betty very well.</i>
Lord, it's gonna
be the shit show.
She's gonna be a lot.
She's gonna be extra.
Oh, really?
She's gonna be a diva.
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>
-Ooh!

<i>My drag is funny</i>
<i>It's irreverent.</i>

My bodysuit says it all.
You're welcome.
[screaming and cheers]
Yes!
-Take it!
-Yeah!
-[screams]
-Yeah!
I'm hilarious, beautiful,
talented, and humble.
How are you?
Now just one more.

The New York girls,

And they just talk
over one another.
0Thorgy, you are--
0Whoo!
-Take it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Too real.
New York, New York,
New York, yeah, girl.
Oh.
<i>Maybe some of</i>
<i>the other queens are, like,</i>
resentful that there's so much
New York City representation.
There's a reason New York City
has some of the best
drag queens in the world
and that is a fact.
This is a gag.
The children don't even know.
[laughter]
All right, ladies.
Let's turn up the juice
and see what shakes loose.
Uh-oh, this is trouble.
Don't say "Beetlejuice"
three times.
I'm Layla McQueen
and I'm 22 years old.
<i>Layla is like a whorey,</i>
<i>quasi-rock star.</i>
I don't want to say gothy,
but like, gothy.
-Hi.
-Hi.
[cheers and applause]
You had the smart idea.
[laughter]
I'm gonna tell you
a story about flats.
No.
14 hours from now,
we're all like, "Ugh, ow!"
She's like Sketchers,
it's the S.
[laughter]
<i>[purposeful piano music]</i>
<i>Laissez les bon temps roulez.</i>
What'd she say?
<i>My name is Chi Chi DeVayne</i>
and I don't get ready,
I stay ready.
-Oh!
-Hey!
My drag is that
real Southern
dragged out style of drag.
Creole fish.
It's like a whole 'nother level
of drag right here.
If you made it to
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"
you made it, honey.
Tell us about yourself.
Well, I'm a cheap queen.
She's on a budget.
Um, I don't mean cheap.
Resourceful.
Yeah, resourceful.
<i>Chi Chi walked in</i>

Yeah!
My name is Derrick Berry.
I'm 32 years old.
<i>I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>
<i>I'm a Britney Spears</i>
<i>impersonator.</i>
I impersonate her
six nights a week
on the Las Vegas Strip.
<i>I would love to believe</i>
<i>that I'm the best</i>
<i>Britney in the world.</i>
That's what people say.
Derrick,
I'm so fucking excited.
-Hey!
-How are you?
Derrick Berry
is huge competition.
She is a quasi-celebrity.
-Hey, Derrick, I'm Bob.
-Bob?
There's two boy names here
this season, girl.
Alright, Bob and Derrick.
So, where you from?
Vegas girl.
Vegas girl.
Yeah, so place your bets on me
if you like to gamble.
Is Beyoncé
scared of Britney?
Then Bob ain't scared
of Derrick.
Okay, I want to know
who else did this.
Who else has been
carb-free for two weeks?
[chuckles]
[siren blaring]
-Shut up!
<i>-Ooh, girl!</i>
This is it!
<i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>
Let's go!
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>Now whether you're</i>
<i>walking children in nature</i>
<i>or feeling the shade of it all,</i>
<i>the time has come for you</i>
<i>to echa, echa, echa pa' lante,</i>
<i>'cause, bitch,</i>
<i>you may be from Chicago</i>
<i>or Cameroon,</i>
<i>but this is not</i>
<i>RuPaul's Best Friend Race.</i>
<i>I have one thing to say.</i>
<i>May I call you Jiggly?</i>
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Beautiful.
Welcome, ladies.
-Whoo!
-Thank you.
Now, are you ready
to make "herstory"?
[all] Yes!
Well, guess what?
You already have.
This is the 100th episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
[cheers and applause]
Isn't that crazy?
And Derrick Berry,
you are the 100th queen
to prance into this workroom.
-Wow!
-Yes!
-Nice!
-Congratulations.
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>RuPaul just said my name.</i>
Like, freaked out.
<i>I feel like it's a new chapter.</i>
Now there's 1 to 99
and I open a new door with 100.
<i>It's crazy.</i>
Now an occasion
such as this
demands to be acknowledged
on an epic scale.
So I've arranged a photo shoot
with some extra special
guest stars.
I hope you're ready
for your close-up
because if you get upstaged,
this 100th episode
could be your last.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>The stakes are high.</i>
Nobody wants to be the first
drag queen voted off the island.
Oh, snuff out your candle.
No!
Now, let's go.
<i>The winner</i>

BeBe Zahara Benet.
Tyra Sanchez.
Raja.
Sharon Needles.
Boo.
Chad Michaels.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Violet Chachki.
And Bianca Del Rio...

[party horn squeaks]
Oh, my God.
Not really a god,
but close enough.
[laughs]
Now, for your first
photo challenge,
we are going to take
some photographs
with the great Mathu Andersen.
We're gonna find out
if you have what it takes
-to stand amongst greatness.
-Got it.
Going to the challenge,
we're looking for
that spark of individuality
<i>and we want to see</i>
<i>who knows how to get</i>
their cream
to rise to the top.
Face is on lock and go.
Body.
Face.
Naysha Lopez was adorable,
incredible energy
and she seemed quite comfortable
quite quickly.
Why, she's covered
in black cock.
[laughter]
Queens of a feather,
stick together.
Acid Betty, we will see
if you have what it takes
to sit among
the goddesses, all right?
Yes, RuPaul,
very intimidating.
Sitting next to these
wannabe ass drag queens.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
[camera shutter clicking]
Lovely.
Beautiful.
Acid Betty,
your pussy's on fire.
Chemical fire.
Is that--
Oh, that's your face.
Yes, yes.
I'm surprised
she didn't smack you.
Acid Betty, that one...
you got to watch that one.
<i>Well, you passed</i>
<i>the acid test, Betty.</i>
Naomi Smalls.
-Hi, girl.
-Hey, girl.
-Go big, Naomi Smalls.
-Okay.

Oh, all of that right there.

once or twice.
<i>I have studied thousands</i>
<i>fashion magazines.</i>
Just let me pose and I'm happy.
She has come to model.
<i>Naomi Smalls</i>
<i>looks really hot.</i>
She has a great ass,
great legs,
but she does have cliff hangers.
You see her toes, like,
literally
clinging onto the shoe.
Boner killer.
Show me the winner.
Robbie Turner.
What?
<i>I am very excited</i>
<i>to see Jinkx.</i>
She's my Seattle homegirl.
She's our hometown hero.
-You fucking bitch.

Really?
Ready to run
with the big dogs?
-I'm ready.
-Get it, trash.
Prove to us
that you're a champion.
I'm gonna
tell you something.
When your skirt covers up
your whole legs
and just leaves two
little feet at the bottom,
it makes me want to laugh,
'cause it looks like you're this
tall with little feet.
[laughter]
Okay, that was my hot tip.
Carry on.
Oh, there she is.
There she is.
Nice.
<i>Pose the house down.</i>

Yeah, you got two more left.
I'll just looked shocked.

How about we do like that black

Nice.
Just keeping it editorial,

Yes.
Thank you.
I saw the tights
and they were ripped.
Next up, Layla McQueen.
Ready, boom.
Oh, okay.
You remind me of a dog trying
to get comfortable on the couch.
Everyone is so gorgeous
and here I am looking
like a Beetlejuice trash bag
and oh, my God.
<i>It's intimidating for sure.</i>
I can go anywhere?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Anywhere you want, girl.
Ready, here we go.
Oh, a nice.
She's a shy girl.
<i>Layla McQueen,</i>

-Can I take this?
-Sure, why not.
Yeah.
Yeah, you seem stronger

Derrick completely used
every last bit of that set
and that's
exactly what you do.
This is the last shot.
Hit me baby, one more time.
Oh, she's toxic.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo.
That was amazing.
Did you guys have fun?
-Whoo!
-Oh, come on, boy Bob.
The de-dragging process
is the most exciting for me
because I want to see what
everybody looks like as a boy
and fuck,
everybody's so cute.
Look at this butch
motherfucker right here.
This is my everyday look, hon.
Layla out of drag,
I want to sleep with.
I like little shorties.
Like, little husky shorties.
Whoo.
Oh, my God, that fucking
Layla's ass is amazing.
I can't help it.
I'm such a top.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Betty, I still can't get over
the gag of seeing you here.
I know, I mean, it is because
some people think I'm dead.
Is that based on
how you look or--
It's how I treat people,
so watch yourself.
-Oh.
-Oh.
A lot of the queens are
turning into hens in a henhouse.
They're like,
"Oh, cluck, cluck."
The competition has begun.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Ladies,

the hardest time
with this challenge.
And I'm like stuck on
what to do for the top.
[groans]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>The maxi challenge this week</i>
<i>is to design a garment</i>
<i>based on past challenges</i>
that other queens from other
seasons have already done.
My theme is the Hair Ball.
What are you doing?
So, do you remember
the Givenchy collection
with like, the big fur?
-Yes.
-It's inspired by that.
I want to find a way to, like,
celebrate this beige color.
Oh, God,
how can you celebrate that?
This material is going to be
challenging to work with,
<i>especially because</i>
<i>everything I have</i>
is a Florence Henderson
shade of poop brown.
There's so much stuff that I'm
trying not to get overwhelmed
and like, I got this and this
and this and this and this.
I don't do drag on a dime.
<i>I don't sew.</i>
<i>I'm a pageant girl.</i>
<i>I brought so many</i>
<i>beautiful garments.</i>
I spend money.
I don't want to get lost
with all the stuff that I got.
You know what I mean?
There's a fucking piggy bank.
A piggy bank.
Am I supposed to
mount this shit on my head?
Make it work, bitch.
Make it work.
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hi.
How's my dirty dozen?
[laughter]
Bob the Drag Queen.
RuPaul.
How did you get
Bob the Drag Queen?
How did that come about?
It's my dad's name.
My dad's name
is The Drag Queen.
[laughs]
It's a family name.
Yeah, Bob stands
for big old bottom, what!
[laughter]
Well, you know it does pay
to advertise.
Now which one did you get?
I got Gone With the Window.
Now do you know how to sew?
I'm not, like,
the world's best sewer,
but I know how
to slap a garment together.
So, you're not
the world's greatest sewer.
What are you
the world's greatest?
I'm a stand-up comedian.
Who's your competition?
You know, Ru, I don't want
to sound so, uh, stereotypical.
Do, do it, it's between us.
I don't--
I don't have competition
because no one here
does what I do.
I learned from listening
to your podcast
with you and Michelle,
that there really is no reason
to pretend to be modest.
I'm fucking funny.
I'm really funny.
Let the world know.
First name, Bob,
last name, The Drag Queen.
Can she turn it?
Yes, she can.
[laughing]
It's true, girl.
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
-Thank you, Ru. Thank you.
-All right.
-Acid Betty.
-RuPaul.
How you doing?
I'm gagging
that you just said my name.
I'm so honored to be here.
Yes, now tell me about
the Brooklyn drag scene.
Well, some of them are here.
Thorgy Thor is here.
Are you guys friends
or are you friendly rivals?
We're definitely friends.
We've never worked together.
I actually haven't worked with
a lot of queens in Brooklyn
because I mostly work
in Manhattan.
-Is that a read?
-It could be.
[laughter]
Describe for me
what Brooklyn drag is.
Technically, I guess,
Brooklyn drag right now
is unpolished,
um, hairy,
so I try and elevate myself
and shave my beard.
Uh-huh, all right.
Now, what challenge did you get?
The Money Ball.
Right, do you know how to sew?
I do, but this is, like,
paper and glue.
Now, I don't see
any paper or glue yet.
So I'm trying to build
a base first
and then attach the paper,
the money to it.
Right.
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
Thank you, RuPaul.
Layla McQueen.
What's going on, lady?
-Which challenge did you get?
-I got the Rupocalypse.
Rupocalypse!
So what do you have planned?
Um, I was given, like,
a few plastic hands
and then like, a shit-ton
of camouflage.
I think camouflage
is a disgusting component
of human culture.
Okay, yeah.
Um, I'd really like to play
with the whole, like,
deconstruction, like,
jagged shapes and like...
Um...
-Rough around the edges.
-Yeah.
Now tell me,
how are you feeling?
You seem a little shy.
I am and we started
this day kind of...
It was--it was all--
it was a lot.
But now, I'm, like,
getting into the groove.
Well, listen, you better
get your shit together
because there's some
very competitive girls here.
Oh, good.
All right, Layla,
I can't wait to see it.
Thanks.
All right, listen up, ladies.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll decide
how you measured up.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Timing is not my friend
right now.
Now I get why girls
have emotional breakdowns.
Amen.
Everyone is freaking out
because in the back of
everyone's mind,
while they're working
on their outfits,
is, "Fuck, I do not want
to go home first."
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

Hello, couture.
This thing is too big.

So I'm not the
only one stressing.
And I'm burning myself,
and I'm burning myself,
and I'm burning myself.
Well stop burning yourself

Did you have to change
anything?
Nothing major,
but I made this clutch,
which I'm very proud of.
Oh, my God.
It is a known fact that
a lady do carry a bag to dinner.
This purse is hideous,
but I'm using it.
I think it goes

That was shade!
No!

Yeah, but you're gambling,

you been doing drag?
Halloween 2003.
<i>I've been doing Britney</i>

are not going to think I can do
anything else,

I have to prove
that I can do more than Britney.
I've found
there's two breeds of queen.
There's Halloween queens

-I was a pride queen.
-Really?
I, like, started drag

I've been doing drag
for two and a half years.
Does your family

My family doesn't know

-Really?
-No.
-At all?
Like, my mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.
Has your mother ever seen you
in drag ever,
like pictures or anything?
Well, I've shown her pictures
of me in drag
and she thinks they're, like,
makeup jobs that I did.
She doesn't recognize
that it's me.
-Stop.
-Really?
Yeah.
<i>I guess I'm worried about</i>
<i>my mom finding out</i>
that I did drag
because growing up,
I always felt like I could
never be a model child

I've already disappointed her
so many times in her life.
She could even stop
talking to me.
And...
And you know, I'm just scared

that's what drag is about.
And then the photo,
<i>you seem like you're a little</i>
<i>bit more of the avant-garde,</i>
artsy, like, you're giving me
Tunnel 1993.
-I was there.
-I might've seen you there.

-Great job.
Thank you Acid Betty.
Next up, Naysha Lopez.
-You're gorgeous.
-Thank you.
You're giving me Eva Longoria,

Your makeup is stunning.
I think, Naysha,
you're beautiful,
but when you're part
of an ensemble photo,
<i>you really want to stand out.</i>
The dark hair and the dark top,
I don't think it works
in this picture.
I have a pet peeve
with seeing undergarments.
So when you turn around
I see illusion net.
Give me the full illusion.
That big gold piece
just makes you look thick
and I just don't think
it looks good.
This is actually the first
garment I've ever made.
I don't really sew.
I felt like it was wearable
and, you know,
I got the challenge down.
All right, well,
thank you very much.
-Next up, Kim Chi.
-Hi.
Your photo is pretty fabulous.
And I really like
your runway look.
You are giving me, like,
this Cowardly Lion
anime ferociousness.
I think it totally worked.
The artistry on your face
is just like geometric orgasm.
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt
and say the walk
was a character choice.
Every time I'm wearing
something different,
I'm living whatever fantasy
of the outfit I've got going on.
In my personal eyes,
I'm an anime character
who works
as a high fashion model.
You're just a total nerd.
-I am.
-I love that.
And by the way, I like that
you kept your areolas bald.
The breasts are the windows
to the soul, for sure.
[laughter]
Nicole,
would you wear this?
I would definitely
wear it.
Where would you wear this?
Um, probably school drop off.
Okay, yeah.
Thank you, Kim Chi.
Next up, Naomi Smalls.
I love that you
are rocking a boy chest.
You're giving me
like, '70s "Studio 54."
Michele,
how do you like her hair?
Very pretty, only
my hairline's not clockable.
Okay, all right.
The Pride Float
was beautifully decorated,
but it became really cumbersome.
And I almost saw you thinking,
"I have to get back in that boat
and strap it on."
And I'm saying that
about the boat.
Yeah, I know, how many times
have you said that in your life?
-Girl.
-Yeah.
But the picture.
Hello?
And it's a big butt.
That is a big butt.
I believe they call that
serving it.
Okay.
That needs to come through
with everything that you do,
whether you're dragging a
50-pound boat with you or not.
Next up,
Robbie Turner.
Your photo, I loved,
because you're giving me kind of
funny glamour there.
-You chose fur?
-It's like a fringe.
Fringy kind of
carpety-looking stuff.
You're literally a blob.
We lose all shape and
from the side, it's even worse.
And you got to choose
your challenge.
I actually forgot that I--
to choose one for myself.
I didn't have
my '40s dress pattern,
but I was trying to figure
it out, like,
at the last minute.
So, it was like a series
of misfortunate events.
Do you think that you deserve
to be in the bottom.
Um, no, I think
my personality is winning.
All right, well, thank you
very much, Robbie Turner.
Next up, Derrick Berry.
Your look tonight,
it's adorable.
I will say it's pretty simple.
I like the comedic moment
where you trimmed
your holiday bush.
I love a bush
on the front door,
but on the back door
not so much.
-No.
-Definitely not berries.
[laughter]
And then your photo,
like, everyone in this photo
looks like
they're your backup dancers
and you're the star.
-Wow.
-We've seen Britney now.
My personal challenge to you
is to show me everything else
but Britney.
-Okay.
-We love your Britney.
I do want to see more of it,
but we do want to see
other things.
I want more!
And I'll give you more.
[laughter]
You can't help yourself,
can you?
Up next,
Layla McQueen.
-Hi, Layla.
-Hey, bitch.
I love the shoulder detail.
Did you sew that?
I sewed the jacket, yes.
-That's pretty impressive.
-Thank you.
But I felt like the bottom
half was just a cop out.
This was a really fun category
I think to like,
do, like,
totally, like, singe.
To me, it's just like,
Wynonna Judd opened the oven
too quickly and got
a little, like, you know,
burnt on the outside.
In the picture we lose you
crumpling up into a ball.
You're with all these
kind of legendary people
and it's almost like your
body's saying "I'm not worthy."
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Do you think
that your missteps
would warrant you
in the bottom?
I think I have
a lot more to show
and I don't think that I am...
the least put together.
Who do you think
is the least put together?
I think Naomi.
Her look is very plain.
Do you agree with that,
Naomi?
No. I tried to take something
that was from a past season
and make it new and fresh.
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
<i>[tense music]</i>
Alright now, just between
us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Let's start with Acid Betty.
I love Acid Betty.
she's a little bit dangerous,
she's rock 'n' roll.
In the photo she looks great,
but she is this punk girl.
Like, give me
a little screaming...
Ahh!
Tongue out punkness.
I don't hate her photo,
and like her name implies,
she's kind of a trip
and she's a little East Village.
Well, you know, I did
a lot of antacid in the 60s
and I think that Acid Betty
really represents that.
[laughter]
<i>[RuPaul]: Alright,</i>
<i>Naysha Lopez.</i>
Her photo, unfortunately,
I think she got lost.
And also,
don't stand on that stage
and tell us
it's the first dress you made.
I mean, this is not the place
you make your first dress.
-Girl.
-You make your first dress
when you learn that
you're gonna come on the show.
Or you make them
when your mom's at work
-and you're in the sixth grade.
-[all laughs]
<i>[RuPaul] All right, next up,</i>
<i>Kim Chi.</i>
I love the photograph.
<i>She was kind of</i>
<i>the queen of the castle</i>
<i>in this anime jungle.</i>
Everything about her tonight
made me happy,
except for
that lumbering walk.
Right, because
she was serving a little bit
of Sasquatch on the runway.
Sasquatch that walk.
You can say Yeti that walk.
Yeti that walk.
[laughter]
<i>Next up, Naomi Smalls.</i>
I love that she looks like
she might faint at any moment.
All I saw
was a really tiny thing
<i>lumbering with</i>
<i>a heavy ass boat.</i>
I kind of like
the contrast of her like,
fumbling with the boat.
It's like a cartoon of an ant
carrying a giant piece
of cheese.
[chuckles] Yeah.
<i>[Ross] Well, that's the picture</i>
<i>of the day.</i>
<i>It says,</i>
<i>"bow down bitches."</i>
If she doesn't bring
the photo her
to this her,
to me, she's gone.
<i>Moving on down</i>
<i>to Robbie Turner.</i>
This look in her photo
is probably her go to look.
<i>It's that Carole Lombard</i>
<i>meets Carol Burnett.</i>
<i>Superstar from the 20s.</i>
But what we saw today
was basic.
Yes, she said
she forgot to choose
a category for herself.
The dog ate my category.
A dingo ate my category.
Quite honestly,
if she put any creativity
into that,
she could've turned it out
and that's a shame
because I like
what I saw in the picture.
Let's move on down
to Derrick Berry.
Her Britney is amazing.
You know he can nail
the Britney thing.
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the photo was phenomenal.</i>
I'm glad she brought
it the first episode.
Now bring Derrick Berry
to the table.
But don't you want to see
a little bit more Britney?
Yes,
we'll get more Britney.
<i>Layla McQueen.</i>
She did the most
basic bottom half to that.
I expect so much more.
This is season eight and
the bar has been raised so high.
There was just
nothing standing out for me.
The worst picture
of the week, by far,
but I find her interesting
because she is an artist.
That warrants
a second chance to me.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

Maxi Challenge,

#NewWaveQueens.
-Hey.
-Working in teams of three,
you'll be writing lyrics
to original retro tracks.
You need to create
a unique style
using clothes, shoes,
and accessories
provided by
Out of the Closet thrift stores.
And tomorrow, in front
of an audience of groupies,
you'll be performing live.
Now I'm gonna let you all
form your own band.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Anarchy!
[laughter]
-I love these bitches.
This is our team.
Team Best Friend Race.
-You want to do New York?
-Oh.
-Yeah!
-Team New York.
<i>-The third team</i>
<i>just seems like</i>
leftovers
just formed together.
-Now there are three
different tracks:
punk, synth, and party,
and I'll let you guys
figure out who gets what.
And on the runway,
the category is neon realness.
[all cheer]
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman rock!
[cheering]
-All right,
let's make a case.
-We want punk.
<i>-Kim, Robbie,</i>
<i>and I choose punk</i>
because we don't want
to give the judges
something
they've seen before.
We want to
really rough it up.
-We want party.
-And we also want party.
[together]
We also want party.
-Okay, let's everyone
in their group
individually say what you want.
-I definitely,
definitely want party.
-Party.
-Party.
Party. And what do you guys
want in your group.
-Party.
-I want party.
-Synth.
'Cause it has soul,
it has rhythm.
-See, and I felt like
that about this.
-Now I will say this group
is unanimous on party,
and you guys
are not unanimous on party.
-Oops!
[laughs]
-There's, like,
this turmoil between
<i>Chi Chi and his group,</i>
so we kind of, like,
pit them against each other.
-I just don't
want you guys to fight.
I don't want
Chi Chi to be upset.
-I genuinely don't think
that your group
will be as strong
with this
'cause you were like,
"I want synth."
You got to turn 'em
against themselves.
[evil laugh]
[coughs]
Just get some water.
So what
are you guys thinking?
-We're gonna go with synth,
and you guys go with party.
-All right.
Thank you so much.
<i>-Derrick and I,</i>
<i>being team players,</i>
decide we're
gonna go with synth.
Let's make it work.
-Girl, we are art.
-That's fine.
You can be art.
-Art, art, art,
art, art.
Art, art,
shekat-kat-boom.
Oh,
shika-kat-kat-ki-kat.
Art,
did somebody mention art?
-I hope
that's not their song.
If that's their song,
that sucks.
<i>[pensive music]</i>
-I got an idea.
What we do is...
we incorporate shapes.
I'm circle, you're triangle,
and you're square.
-That's cool.
-We can even be
The Shapes.
-I think our costumes
should be that shape,
you know what I mean?
Like, cardboard cut-out
geometric shapes.
-Yeah, no.
-We should just be,
like, this is our head,
this is our hands.
<i>I'm not surprised Chi Chi</i>
<i>came up with this concept.</i>
This is, like,
a girl that shops at Michael's
for every outfit
that she owns.
-Just thought
we'd come on stage dressed like
a square, a circle,
and a triangle.
To me, that would be
more visually appealing.
-No.
-Naysha's already gone
home once.
<i>Derrick just got clocked</i>
<i>by the judges,</i>
and I sure in hell
don't want Michelle
calling me basic again.
We all need
to step our game up.
-I don't want
to help you guys,
but the genre in which you guys
are doing of synth
was all about
geometrical shapes, oddness.
Kaossonome was, like--he was
a walking triangle.
-But, I mean,
we can be fashionistas.
That's fine.
-If you could show me something
that's not a cardboard box
on my body then
I want to see it.
-I'm with Chi Chi.
-Acid Betty, seriously?
Shut the fuck up.
And you're the oldest one
in the bunch,
you should know better.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-We have to make it funny.
-Right, absolutely.
-Yeah.
-This week's Maxi Challenge
is to form new wave bands.
We have to write lyrics
and perform our track live.
-What if we just
wrote something, like,
just completely,
like off the cuff.
Like, I don't know,
chicken wings.
-Yeah, it could be our thing.
-That could be cute.
-The other team,
like, I don't--
Kim Chi and Robbie
as punk?
<i>-[Naysha Lopez] When I look at</i>
<i>Kim Chi, Robbie, and Naomi,</i>
I sure as hell
don't see no punk.
-And then chicken wing.
Maybe our song is, like,
something hot and spicy.
-Louisiana's finest.
-Barbeque.
-[Derrick Bary] You're a punk
group, and you're gonna scream
about chicken wings
and dipping sauces?
-Let's go chicken wings.
-[laughs]
-Nothing about this
is finger-licking good.
That group is gonna lose.
Like a Stepford Wife,
your fantasy.
-Or why don't you say,
"I'm not a Stepford Wife."
-Oh, that's good.
-I'm, like,
really excited about this.
-Well, Chi Chi
will help us soul this up too.
-Yeah.
<i>-I feel like Chi Chi doesn't</i>
<i>really want to be in our group.</i>
His energy is really off.
-I know
y'all want to work together,
but I have, like,
no look for neon couture,
so could I, like, go over
and cutout something real quick?
-Oh, Lord.
-Well, that sucks.
[sighs]
<i>-♪ You could be square, now,</i>
<i>just don't be a nun ♪</i>
Chi Chi,
how did that sound?
Chi Chi, were you
listening, or no?
-It was good.
-Yeah, I think that's cool.
And if he doesn't like it,
he can change it.
<i>-Girl,</i>
<i>it's a group challenge.</i>
Engage...
<i>because that's what you do</i>
<i>when you're on a team.</i>
-Where did Chi Chi go?
-So I'm working
on my runway outfit
because these bitches
have fabulous costumes,
and I'm gonna walk
out in a neon bathing suit.
<i>So if it seems like</i>
<i>I'm a little worried, I am.</i>
<i>And that's why I'm quiet.</i>
I'm distancing myself
from the girls,
but you know what?
I'ma work this shit out.
<i>Peace.</i>
-All right,
let's keep writing.
How about the first line
is what's that smell?
-Hm, love it.
-'Cause we're singing about
street meat.
-You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.
-It's quicker.
-You like to explain it.
-Yeah.
-When we go "yes,"
you don't have to convince us.
-And we just laugh
because you're--you--
-I just--
-'Cause we go like this,
"Yeah," and you go,
"It's so much simple, and,
"you know, I thought about it,
and you go like this.
"And there's a four-count,
and a four-count are so much
better than a three-count."
-Yeah. You're not
the most time-efficient.
-I'm very detail-oriented
and neurotic.
My process is,
like, I sit there and examine
every little tiny thing,
tear it all apart,
and put it back together.
-This is where the big
black beans could come in.
You see what I mean?
-No.
-Thorgy, is that not funny?
Come on, that is--
-Uh, no,
I don't think it's funny.
-What?
-[groans]
-What sets me off
is this sound...
[groans]
-[groans].
-Ugh.
-Ugh.
-[groans]
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.
You got to stop with, "Ugh."
-I really don't
mean it that way.
I have an ear for music,
rhythm, and, like, beats.
I'm a professionally trained
violinist, violist,
and cellist, so, like,
I have a very critical ear.
Don't argue with me.
I just wish you would trust me
when I say, like, a suggestion.
-We do.
-We do trust you.
Do you not see yourself
all over the song?
-All right,
now I know
that I can't even
speak without being attacked.
-No, that's not true.
Thorgy--
Thorgy is driving me crazy.
She's not contributing
as much as she's negating.
-I'm actually
holding back, like, 94%
of, like, what
I actually want to say.
-Thorgy, I really
love this drape-y fabric on you.
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, and then the other group's
trying to sneak in
and break down our defenses.
-Is it an actual cardigan.
-Just a simple scarf.
-Thorgy, you are
so easily distracted.
Oh, my God.
And they're looking for
the easiest chink in our armor,
and it's Thorgy.
-Thorgy, hi.
-Hey.
They keep changing my lyrics.
My lyrics are so good,
and they're like,
"Let's change it to this,"
which is, like, idiotic--
-Thorgy,
stop talking to them!
Jesus.
[laughs]
<i>I'm just over it.</i>
<i>Whose team are you on?</i>
Like, are you working
with the chicken wings
or whatever their fucking
names are?
-You guys are so fun.
Like, that's hilarious.
Team New York is in
a small, little boat,
and it's got a hole,
and it's sinking.
-I really think you're trying
to, like,
destroy the process almost.
-I'm really not.
-Now you're being
dramatic, Bob.
-Yes! Thank you!
He's being so dramatic!
-I didn't know I was
with two coo-coo birds.
-Those bitches
are going down.
-Hi.
-Hi, ladies.
-Ru hooked us up
with a Lucian rehearsal
for this challenge,
and my team is up first.
-Let's go ahead and see
what you've put together so far.
-There's a lot of pressure
on me for this challenge
because the judges weren't crazy
about my performance last week,
and I feel like this character
is gonna show them
that I do have soul.
-Here we go.

-Somebody just
snatched your wig,
tripped you,
and stole all your heels.
[all scream]
It still feels
like you're scared to,
like, let it out.
<i>-[Robbie Turner] So we're</i>
<i>trying to be punk and angst-y,</i>
but it was not working,
<i>and I'm feeling the pressure.</i>
I have been on
the bottom of the game,
so I need this win
more than anybody else
in this competition.
-Hello.
-How are you?
-How are you feeling song-wise,
lyrics and everything?
-I love it, anyway.
<i>[plucky music]</i>
-It's good. It's good.
-What's wrong?
-We love it.
-[laughs]
-So wait, you're not
all on the same page with it?
-We are on the same page.
-We are. We are.
We are. We are. We are.
-Thorgy just talks like that.
-We are, but she's, like...
-That's how she talks.
-Literally nit-picking.
-But we have a final product
that we're all happy with.
-We're good.
-Churl, I'm just over it.
I can't argue
with Thorgy anymore.
-I'm really--I'm happy.
-All right.
Here we go.
Cue track.
<i>-♪ What's that smell? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We got</i>
<i>something to sell ♪</i>
<i>all:</i>
<i>♪ It's called street meat ♪</i>
<i>♪ You can shop around</i>
<i>the prices can't be beat ♪</i>
-Ow!
-The only thing I would say
is that it was very character-y
and almost theatrical
instead of cool,
'80s, new wave vibe.
-All right. Cue music.
-<i> all: ♪ It's called street</i>
<i>meat ♪</i>
-Whoo!
<i>-♪ No need to yell ♪</i>
-All right, all right.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
So this is what
I'm talking about.
You're saying it exactly the way
you'd say it in a musical.
What's that smell?
That sort of doesn't have
the cool, B-52s' vibe.
Right now
it's just reading as,
like, cheesy,
and you're just like, "Ehh."
-I think the B-52s
are kind of cheesy.
-The B-52s are just
one example of a party band.
I'm just trying to direct
you to be more cool
because that's
what this era was about.
-That's how
they sound to me.
What do you mean by
"more cool"?
I don't get that feel
from our track.
Am I alone in this?
Really? No one?
<i>-[Acid Betty] Girl, you got to</i>
<i>listen.</i>
Open the ears,
close the mouth.
He's telling us to lay back,
stop be so,
"Hey, girl,
yeah, whoo, yeah!"
-I just don't know what
you're saying, Lucian, baby.
I just don't.
-You don't understand
what I'm saying?
-No.
-It's just about creating
your own style.
Like,
even someone like Lorde.
-I hate her.
I can't with her.
-Okay. Well--
I'm just telling you,
she has her style.
-When you think of Lorde,
I think of, like,
apathetic teenager.
Av--Ooh.
-I'm just trying to help you.
-I guess so I'll be Lorde.
-It's very surprising
that any queen
would come for me
because I'm gonna
be judging these bitches.
I'm not saying
to be Lorde.
I'm not saying
to be the B-52s,
but it can be
some other sort of melody
that is your thing.
-It's like,
"You're not the B-52s,
but how would B-52s say it?"
Is what it sounds
like to me.
<i>-[Thorgy Thor] Oh, my God.</i>
You are embarrassing us
in front of a judge.
If we're in the bottom,
Bob is going home, not me.
<i>-I know I shouldn't</i>
<i>be arguing with Lucian.</i>
I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm already in argument-mode
because Thorgy has got me
at the very edge of the cliff.
<i>Lucian's just</i>
<i>an innocent bystander.</i>
I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.
<i>[upbeat mellow music]</i>
-Drag is not
a cheap profession.
-It's really not.
-I know. You got to do
what you got to do to live.
-Do you have enough
to, like, live off of?
-We were always
fortunate kids,
but we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.
So when I got
out of high school,
I started getting
all these loans
and just started
trying to find money.
-Yeah.
-And now I'm going
through a bankruptcy.
-Wow.
How much is your debt?
-It's, like,
in the tens of thousands.
<i>-Chi Chi] I work two jobs</i>
<i>washing cars</i>
<i>and checking</i>
<i>out people's groceries.</i>
Being broke is
a hurting feeling.
<i>People say they don't have</i>
<i>a dime to their name,</i>
but when you literally
don't have a dime,
you taking all your
shit to the Coinstar
to, like--
just to get $5.00,
like, I don't think
these girls understand that.
Not having the money
to buy fabric
and all that kind of stuff,
I just use what I got,
and that's where I find
myself saying, "Oh, I'm here
for the $100,000,"
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.
-When I want to be here
for the experience,
but in the back of my mind,
I just feel like
I need money,
and it's not all
about money all the time.
That's exactly why the stakes
in this competition
is so high to me.
It's not an option
for me to fail.
-I'm gonna put my hair up
and do my makeup,
like, immediately.
-Yeah, I am too.
-I'm always,
like, the last person
running around
with my head cut off.
-And yet you still win.
Every time.
-I've never won.
-Frida Kahlo
got a special mention.
-Yeah, a special mention...
-That was winning.
-That I was good
at the dance challenge
but didn't win,
but I was top,
and then we did
the acting challenge,
and I was, like--they were like,
"You were really good,
but--"
-Yup.
-I feel like
I'm the Susan Lucci.
-[gasps]
Come on. Susan?
-I'm the Susan Lucci
of the season.
<i>[Thorgy Thor  I nailed the</i>
<i>"Empire" acting Challenge,</i>
<i>and I was safe.</i>
<i>Bob wore literally</i>
<i>a $20 Halloween costume</i>
<i>that was falling apart,</i>
<i>and she won.</i>
<i>And, like, Bob is funny,</i>
<i>but so am I.</i>
I'm just not
as loud and annoying.
They were like,
"You were so wonderful.
You floored us.
We couldn't stop watching you.
Bob, you win."
-It seems
like Bob and Thorgy
are in a competition
of their own,
and somebody's feelings
are inevitably
going to get hurt.

Now it's time for
the judge's critiques.
First up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Lucian.
Can I just say
before we get started,
yesterday,
I wasn't the kindest to you,
and that's not me,
and I apologize.
-What was going on?
-I wasn't really understanding
the references he was giving me.
Then I was like, "Well,
I don't even like that artist."
-Who was the artist?
-It was Lorde.
-Oh, well, you're in luck.
She's our guest judge next week.
-Whoo!
[laughter]
-Well,
I accept your apology,
and, today,
I was impressed,
<i>especially with</i>
<i>the black beans line.</i>
It really highlighted
your character.
Great job.
-[Michelle] I think ratchet
drag is your thing,
but I am in love
with the way you look tonight.
-Thank you.
-It's in the step
in the fashion direction.
Less ratchet, more fashion.
-But you have to stay
professional at all times,
no matter
how pissed off you are.
-Next up, hey there,
Thorgy girl.
-I'm not crazy
about this look tonight.
This is going on.
This is going on.
This is going on.
This is--
There's just so much
that I'm losing you.
-But you slayed it
in the performance.
You kept drawing my attention.
-Next up, Acid Betty.
-This thing is mind-blowing.
This is epic.
-I mean, did you actually
make that wig yourself?
-I made everything you see
but the shoes, yeah.
-Wow. Very good.
-Until you came out
in that challenge,
I got more Patty Duke
than I did Acid Betty.
I didn't get
why everybody else kind of
went crazy new wave,
and you went '50s.
It made me feel
that you weren't in your element
for the first time.
-Oh, okay.
I totally felt like I was,
so that's weird
that you felt that way.
-[RuPaul] Up next,
<i>♪ Hey, Derrick ♪</i>
-Your makeup
made me so happy.
I did not see a trace
of she-who-shall-not-be-named.
-Yes.
-Tonight on the runway,
do you look pretty?
Yes, but I'm still waiting
for that breakthrough.
-I'm hearing
Britney Spears a lot,
but I--when I saw you
with the bangs
I thought you could do Debbie.
Maybe you should audition
for the movie.
-Oh.
-Wow.
-Call my agent.
-Well,
you have a terrific voice.
-Thank you.
-But you were kind of,
like, disappointing
as a performer.
I don't know what's
happening in your head
because you're not
giving us 100%.
-[RuPaul] All right,
next up, Naysha Lopez.
-Hi, Ru.
-Tell me about this outfit.
It feels like it's
painted on you.
-Yeah.
It's actually all airbrushed.
-And more to the point,
your ass is real?
-Yes. It's real.
-You got it from your Mama.
-And my daddy.
-Does your daddy deal
in medical-grade silicone?
[laughter]
-This is fun.
I think this is something
different for you.
[chuckles]
Now the outfit
in the group,
<i>it was like</i>
<i>part Dolly Parton,</i>
and then the circle
that wasn't really a circle.
-[RuPaul] In terms of the outfit
in your group,
were you in charge of that?
-It was a group challenge,
so we really participated
with everything
when it--you know--
-[RuPaul] Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.
You're saying it was not
a group effort?
-No, the thing
Thorgy had on her head,
that's what I wanted
to wear as the actual costume.
-I see.
-I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.
Absolutely not.
-Is this the first
you all are hearing
any dissention from Chi Chi?
-She was just disconnected.
-I see.
-You know, like, it was,
like, "Hey, Chi Chi,
"you want to come over here
really quick?
You know, we're gonna look
at some references,"
and it's like,
"All right. Whatever."
-Well, they was--
-I was told to
step my drag up,
and that's what
I wanted to do.
-So tell me why you're
out here in a bathing suit
with no corset and a belt.
-I don't have the expenses
to pay for something like this.
I'm in a bankruptcy.
I just don't have--
-Hold on.
You don't need money,
girl.
That's never an excuse.
I know you can turn a show.
What concerns me
is the attitude a little bit.
I'm getting the feeling
that you have fought very hard
to be where you are.
I get it,
but we're lifting you up.
Let us.
-I hear you.
I'm sorry, y'all,
that, you know,
I just kind of
halfed it, and--
-No, no, it's okay.
It's cool, sister.
-I don't want y'all
to feel like that, you know,
I tried to throw y'all
under the bus or anything, but--
-What is this bus
everybody keeps talking about?
[laughter]
Is the bus still running?
[laughter]
Thank you, ladies.
While you un-tuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
All right, now
just between us Sunday girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with
Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob was giving me
a little attitude,
but this is
a high-pressure competition.
-Absolutely.
-And I think personality things
that they may not even
like in themselves
sometimes come out.
<i>-[Debbie] And Bob did stand</i>
<i>out.</i>
Bob has a lot of charisma
and seems to know who he is.
<i>-[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.</i>
-She delivered
on this challenge.
<i>There's just something</i>
<i>so quirky about her.</i>
-I agree.
I was totally drawn to her.
-Michelle, you had an issue
with her outfit.
-There was just so much
going on.
-Did she paint sideburns on?
-Down her cheekbones
and around her jawline,
<i>down her neck,</i>
<i>and down her arms.</i>
-I think her challenge
in this competition
is to edit it down.
<i>-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.</i>
-You know, I watch this show
all the time,
and I was kind of waiting
for this "Wow" moment,
and that was Betty's runway.
-But her outfit
in the performance
just was not cohesive for me,
and because of it,
she was completely swallowed up
by those other two girls.
<i>-[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.</i>
<i>-[Michelle] Most frustrating</i>
<i>thing, for me,</i>
is how temporary Derrick
is in performing.
And she's so not used
to performing something
other than Britney.
-But she, you know,
really had an outstanding voice.
-But it's hard
to judge her as her,
because Ru,
think about Chad Michaels.
-Mm-hmm.
-She can do tons
of other drag than Cher.
Derrick has to find a way
to break through that mold.
<i>-[RuPaul] Naysha Lopez.</i>
-I kind of lost her
in the performance
<i>to the other two.</i>
-Now she was eliminated,
and we brought Naysha back.
-She wants to be here so bad,
I can tell.
-Uh-huh.
-She's trying so hard,
but I don't know
if she is giving us enough.
<i>-[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
-In the performance,
she was the standout for me.
-She does have this mysterious
magnetic quality.
-On the runway, however,
there's no excuse
<i>for you to come out here</i>
<i>being that basic.</i>
No.
-I watch this show
all the time,
and you cannot wear
the same shoes
for the challenge
and the runway.
I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

Welcome to the grand finale
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race."
Yes, the tribe has gathered,
heeney. [laughs]
I know we‘re in the middle
of a presidential election,
but tonight this
is the race everybody‘s
talking about...
because together,
right here on Logo TV,
we can make America
gay again!
[cheers and applause]
And I got to tell you,
in this theater
you have my permission
to use any damn bathroom
you want.
[cheers and applause]
Well,
except mine, of course.
You hear that, Jiggly?
Tonight our legendary judges
are here.
Fresh from the drop-off
at Calabasas Junior High School,
it‘s Michelle Visage.
[cheers and applause]
[laughs]
Also here are Ross Mathews
and Carson Kressley.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Now, this season
we‘ve been to Oz and back,
but the competition
ain‘t over.
Bob The Drag Queen,
Kim Chi, and Naomi Smalls...
[cheers and applause]
Tonight one of you
will be crowned
America‘s next drag superstar,
but I have not made
my final decision,
and because we‘re still
keeping it 100,
I‘ve asked each of you
to prepare
a lip sync performance
to a song created just for you.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and to show the world
that you deserve to be
America‘s next drag superstar,
so good luck,
and don‘t fuck it up.
[cheers and applause]
Now, our top three queens
have snatched your attention
all season long,
and tonight
I‘ve challenged each of them
to slay the stage one last time.
Purse first,
a New York City girl
who puts the taint
in entertaintment,
give it up
for a demure little lady
we call
Bob The Drag Queen.

[audience chanting] Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!
[cheers and applause]
-Wow.
-[laughs]
Work it out for team humble.
[cheers and applause]
Now, while you catch
your breath,
let‘s talk to the judges.
Michelle Visage,
what‘d you think?
That was amazing.
Come on, choreography.
Phenomenal.
I‘m so proud of you.
And I love that you play safe.
Every one of your dancers
was wearing a hard hat.
I love that.
[laughter]
It‘s important.
I think you need to change
your name to Bob The Superstar.
Ooh.
Well, thank you, judges.
Now, Bob The Drag Queen,
from the moment
you entered the workroom
you had uniqueness, nerve,
and talent written all over you.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>-[Bob] My name is</i>
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
<i>I‘m hilarious, beautiful,</i>
<i>talented, and humble.</i>
<i>That‘s the biggest</i>
<i>pearl necklace I‘ve ever seen.</i>
-How you doing, RuPaul?
-[laughs]
I‘m sorry that I‘m late,
but "Uzo Abubu"
left the stage.
[laughing]
Well, then why did I waste
my time putting on this?
Oh, there‘s more.
This.
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.
<i>-[Bob] Insert shady</i>
<i>rattlesnake noise here.</i>
[rolls tongue]
-Bob, how‘s your head?
-No complaints.
<i>-[Bob] I‘m Bob The Drag Queen,</i>
<i>a queen for the people.</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[cheers and applause]
Now, Bob, when did you first
become aware of drag?
I used to watch
"To Wong Foo."
Yas!
I saw, like, this, like,
glamazonian, like,
goddess coming down
from the ceiling
wearing a big confederate flag.
I was like,
"Oh, this bitch is--"
when I say bitch,
I mean it, like,
the way you‘d call
your grandmother a bitch.
[laughter]
I was like, "This bitch
is pushing buttons, girl,"
and I loved it.
You excelled at so many
of the challenges.
Did you study the show
before you came on?
No,
I‘m just really talented.
[laughter]
You know, listen,
this is my favorite show.
This is what I thought I was
supposed to be doing
my whole life.
When I was performing in,
like, bars in New York City,
dodging beer bottles
literally,
I was like,
"This doesn‘t feel right.
There‘s something bigger
coming."
Lo and behold,
I found something bigger.
Her name is RuPaul,
and she blessed me.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Bob, at one point
in the season
the other queens
were rooting for you to fail.
-Mm-hmm.
-What did that feel like?
It felt like
I was doing it right.
[laughs]
I mean, no one‘s rooting
for the person doing the worst.
No one‘s like, "Oh, you‘re doing
bad. You should get out."
They‘re like,
"Ooh, she‘s doing so well.
Get her the fuck
out of here."
All right,
so we‘ve got some
fan questions over there.
[cheers and applause]
Hallelu, I‘m back,
RuPaul!
[laughter]
Tucker from Florida
wants to know,
"Does your humor come
from overcoming
a dark place in your life?"
Um, see, I mean,
I have the struggles
that a lot of y‘all homosexuals
here had, especially--
What?
They‘re--wait, wait--
They‘re--this--
[laughter]
These are homosexuals?
A few.
I had the same hardships
that everyone else here has,
and we all deal with it
in different ways.
If you find something
to filter your pain
and your anger into,
it‘ll flourish.
It really will.
Thank you, Shangela.
Now, Bob,
you blew everyone away
with your Snatch Game
impersonations.
Now, did you ever hear
from Uzo or Carol Channing?
Well, Uzo
tweeted at me
and was like,
"This was amazing,"
and I was like, "Thank you,"
and I am obsessed
with Carol Channing,
but she‘s just--she‘s 95.
It‘s hard to get
out of the house when you‘re 95.
I‘m 18, and it‘s hard
for me to get out, so.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, we did hear from
the one and only Carol Channing.
Take a look.
<i>Thank you, Bob,</i>
<i>for your colorful</i>
<i>impersonation of me.</i>
<i>I‘m so honored</i>
<i>to be a part of your history.</i>
<i>Oh, I‘m proud of that.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Oh, my God.
Yes.
So Bob, I know your brother‘s
over there, right?
Yeah, he‘s the one who‘s just
a shade darker than me.
I‘m 11:00.
He‘s midnight.
[laughter]
Justin, what was it
like growing up with Bob?
Bob used to cry
on my birthdays
‘cause it wasn‘t about him.
That‘s true.
That‘s true.
Now, Bob,
I know that your mother
couldn‘t be here
because of her health.
-Yes.
-Darn, you know,
it would have been
a great opportunity for us
to have a taped message
or something,
but we didn‘t--we don‘t have--
wait a minute.
Oh, actually,
we do have a taped message.
- Oh.
- Let‘s roll that.
- Hey.
-<i> Bob, this is your mother.</i>
<i>I‘m very proud of you.</i>
<i>I‘ve always believed in you,</i>
<i>even when you didn‘t</i>
<i>believe in yourself.</i>
<i>Continue to work hard</i>
<i>on your craft.</i>
<i>Always respect your fans.</i>
<i>Reach for the stars,</i>
<i>Chris, do the best you can.</i>
<i>Like I always tell you</i>
<i>and your brother,</i>
keep the first thing
the first thing,
and I love you.
[cheers and applause]
You got me.
You got me.
Oh, my goodness.
Now, Bob, what would it mean
to you to win $100,000?
$100,000 isn‘t the thing
because money comes and goes,
but winning this title,
that means something.
You get to go forth
and carry a legacy
and do something and make
a change in somebody‘s life
and put first things first
and do something.
Right, well--right, well--
Now, I‘ve watched
all 109 episodes
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
and I‘ve noticed
you have never once
walked into
the room purse first.
Oh, my God,
look at this.
Oh,
and it matches my outfit.
It‘s perfect.
I love it.
Purse first.
I love it.
[cheers and applause]
Give it up for Bob
The Drag Queen.
Up next we‘ve got
an Instagram superstar
who‘s about to
lisp sync for her life.
Now serving Kim Chi.

Kim Chi,
I love that song.
It‘s got a good beat,
and you can‘t dance to it.
[laughter]
All right, Kim Chi,
let‘s hear from the judges.
Michelle Visage,
what‘s the tea on Kim Chi?
I love that your purity
and your beautiful energy
took something that was normally
considered negative
and turned it into something
fun and beautiful.
Yes.
Nailed it.
[laughter]
Today Kim Chi
is on the menu,
and you are the main course.
Who‘s hungry?
Now, Kim Chi, you came
to this competition hungry.
You won the first challenge,
and then you stayed hungry.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>My name is Kim Chi.</i>
<i>-[Kim] I came to chop suey</i>
<i>the competition.</i>
<i>I‘m known for crazy,</i>
<i>over-the-top</i>
<i>pure anime fantasy.</i>
Animazing.
<i>I may across shy</i>
<i>because I am soft-spoken,</i>
but donut come for me
because I‘ll destroy you.
I do get concerned
about your walk.
It‘s very stiff, darling.
Exqueeze me?
My mom doesn‘t know
that I do drag.
What?
Kim Chi,
you didn‘t just get better.
You got fierce.
<i>I don‘t want to be</i>
<i>America‘s next drag superstar.</i>
<i>I am America‘s</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
Now, Kim Chi,
you were so honest
and vulnerable this season.
In fact,
watching the show back,
at one point
you made me ugly cry, girl,
so I hope you don‘t mind
if I ask you
some very personal questions.
First one, when was
the last time you fell down?
[laughter]
Actually, earlier today.
I‘m not even joking.
I tripped on my skirt,
and I fell over
the craft service table.
[laughter]
Now, everyone
is gagging on your looks,
just so many amazing looks.
What inspires you?
My inspiration comes
from a lot of random places.
I could be walking
down the street
and see a rock and be like,
"Oh, that rock is pretty.
Let me make a gown
inspired by the rock,"
so there‘s no one
set inspiration,
but everyday life and nature.
Now, is it true
you gave the $3,000
you won in
the first challenge
to your mother?
Why‘d you do that?
My mom works really hard to,
you know, pay the bills,
and she works as a server
at a Korean restaurant
currently,
and I want to do everything
that I can to help
my mom financially.
Yeah.
Have you told her
that you do drag yet?
I still have not,
but, you know, it‘s like--
She didn‘t watch the show?
I mean,
she‘s very Korean-American,
and she‘s really, like, not open
to American culture at all,
so I don‘t think--
yeah, I don‘t think
she‘ll ever find out
about "Drag Race."
Well, listen,
I am a firm believer in
things happen when
they‘re supposed to happen,
so right after this,
why don‘t we drive
over to your mother‘s house
and I tell her myself?
-Road trip?
-Road trip.
- Road trip.
- Yes.
Who‘s here
supporting you tonight?
I have my friend
Ryan, Diana, Amy, and Trixie.
So Diana, what do you think
of Kim Chi‘s journey?
I think Kim Chi
is the most creative, talented,
and hardworking person I know.
I‘m so happy
to be your friend,
and I want the best for you.
All right, now,
we‘ve got some fan questions
for you, Kim Chi.
Oh, look,
we have the Pit Crew coming d--
and they--
you forgot your pants, guys.
Kim Chi,
Tiara from Facebook asks,
"If you could
lose your virginity
to a member of the Pit Crew,
who would it be?"
Um, I‘m not trying
to catch anything,
so I‘m gonna say none of them,
but--
[audience groans, laughs]
Shade. Shade.
Shade!
[laughs]
Oh, thank you,
Pit Crew members.
I don‘t know what
to say after that.
All right, Kim Chi,
well, we have one more question.
Well, actually,
it‘s more of a statement.
Take a look.
Kim Chi,
I am supreme leader,
but you are supreme
drag queen.
You better work,
or else I put you
in a labor camp.
Kim Chi, it‘s Margaret Cho.
I‘m so proud of you.
You‘re so beautiful.
You are so funny, and I think
you are a good dancer.
[cheers and applause]
So Kim Chi,
what would it mean to you
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?
It would obviously
change my life.
I‘d be able to not be broke.
I‘d be able to afford
guacamole on my burrito bowl.
I‘d be able to start
my own makeup company,
which I would love to do,
and it would mean that
anybody who‘s ever felt
like they weren‘t
part of anything,
anybody that felt like
they couldn‘t be anything,
as long as you stay true
to who you are,
be creative, be original,
and your dreams
will eventually come true.
Well, Kim Chi,
read my lisp,
we love you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Kim Chi.
[cheers and applause]
Now it‘s time for our
final performance
of the night.
Oh, and by the way,
kittens,
you can buy these
top three songs right now
wherever fine music is sold,
and you can watch them
again and again
at logotv.com.
Now, our next queen
strutted her stuff
all the way to the top.
Please give a big supermodel
welcome to Naomi Smalls.

Legs for days.
Okay, Naomi, let‘s talk
to the judges. Michelle Visage?
Honey, whatever‘s on the menu,
I‘m buying two.
Look how far
you‘ve come, honey,
and you have proven tonight
that you have legs up
on the competition.
Yes, you do.
You came, you saw,
you contoured,
and you conquered.
Yes.
Thank you, Naomi Smalls.
Now, as the youngest queen
to compete this season,
you‘ve come a long way,
baby.
Let‘s take a look.
I am Naomi Smalls.
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.
<i>-[Naomi] Naomi has legs all</i>
<i>the way up to her asshole.</i>
<i>Naomi is a fashion girl.</i>
She‘s fucking fierce.
Bitches better beware.
Oh, all of that right there.
<i>I‘m giving you Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>strutting down</i>
<i>a Versace runway.</i>
I just thought
it was perfection.
This is how you win
this competition.
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.
This is my mom.
She‘s, like, the best mom ever.
Do you have a message
you want to say to your mother?
Thank you for everything
you‘ve ever done,
and I hope I can repay you
for the rest of my life.
I‘m Naomi Smalls,
and I promise
to represent you fiercely.
[cheers and applause]
Naomi, you have the fever
and the flavor for fashion.
Now, where does that come from?
I honestly don‘t know
because I grew up in, like,
a family
that was--sorry, guys,
not the most fashion-forward
or anything like that,
but I just remember,
like, looking at magazines
when I was a kid and just
being so obsessed with them,
and I wanted to look
like these amazing supermodels
-that were in the glossy pages.
-Sure, yeah.
Now, halfway through
the competition
you seemed to come to life.
What happened?
I was so scared
in the beginning
of standing out and--like,
for the wrong reasons,
but when it comes
to Snatch Game,
you can‘t hide anywhere,
and being in the bottom two
and having to lip
sync for my life
just put that fire
underneath my ass
to take chances and stand out
for all the right reasons.
-Yeah, you did really well.
-Thank you.
Now, Naomi,
we have a taped message
from one fierce queen.
Let‘s take a look.
Hi, Naomi.
Now, in Westeros
there‘s only room
for one queen,
but in Ru‘s queendom, girl,
I can‘t wait to see
you take that crown.
Now...Cersei that walk.
[cheers and applause]
-I love that.
-So good.
Now, we have some
fan questions.
G-G-G-Gia?
-Herminio from Mexico...
-Hi, Herminio.
Would like to know
how did it feel
when Naomi Campbell
checked you online?
[laughs] It was, like,
the biggest moment of my life.
What did she say?
Well, she followed me
on Instagram,
and then she had,
like, this interview saying,
"I really am loving that
Naomi Smalls," and I, like--
I love that.
Tell me this.
What would it mean to you
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?
It would mean
the world to me
to be America‘s
next drag superstar.
Just to get that
stamp of approval
from you and carry on
your legacy would be--
<i>-[Crowd] Yeah, supermodel,</i>
<i>work!</i>
The biggest goal
I ever met in my life.
I love it.
Now, before we go,
I want to say hello
to your mother.
Where is she?
She‘s right there.
- Would you--where--
Oh, there she is.
Hi.
So June,
what was it like
raising a leggy supermodel?
Well, I‘m a little shocked
that he didn‘t get
fashion tips from me.
I had no idea.
He has always been amazing.
-Really?
-Yes.
Did you buy the fashion
magazines, or did--
No, but I did start buying
the wigs and the shoes
and the--
[cheers and applause]
Now, besides Naomi,
how many kids did you raise?
-12 altogether.
-Wow.
Wow.
Naomi, where are
your other brothers
and sisters tonight?
Well, they‘re
all over the world.
They‘re actually
all over this theater too.
Well, let‘s bring them out,
the Von Trapp family singers.
[laughter]
Come on out.
Where are they?
Oh! Oh! How are you?
- Hi, sweetie.
- How are you?
-How are you?
-Ahh!
You know,
like I always say,
the family that drags together
slays together.
Let‘s hear it
for the legendary,
all legs, no dairy,
Naomi Smalls.
Now, we‘re just moments
away from crowning
America‘s next drag superstar,
but first it‘s time
to bring back my girls.
[cheers and applause]
Starting with a nerdy bird,
a glam rock rebel,
and one cuckoo queen.
My name is
Dax ExclamationPoint.
What‘s up, nerds?
<i>-[Dax] My look is very</i>
<i>inspired by, like, science</i>
<i>fiction</i>
<i>and comics,</i>
<i>strong, bad bitches</i>
<i>who don‘t take any crap</i>
<i>from anybody else.</i>
Show me your
exclamation point.
Yeah!
All right, ladies,
let‘s turn up the juice
and see what shakes loose.
<i>Laila is,</i>
<i>like, a whory quasi--</i>
I don‘t want to say gothy,
but, like, gothy.
<i>-[Tyler] My biggest concern is</i>
<i>that I‘m gonna</i>
<i>fade into the background.</i>
I‘m here too.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
Laila McQueen,
neither one of you
survived that lip sync.
Sashay away.
<i>-[Dax] Both of us?</i>
Really?
How you doing,
mis amores?
My name is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Do you want to see my cuckoo?
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
I need a space
for this junk in the trunk.
<i>-[Cynthia] I‘m sexy as a</i>
<i>goddess is.</i>
<i>I‘m funny as a clown.</i>
♪ I am sickening ♪
<i>[record scratches]</i>
Did my teeth look yellow?
No.
[cheers and applause]
Dax ExclamationPoint
and Laila McQueen, welcome back.
-Hello.
-Hey, Ru.
So Dax, I hear that the song
"I Will Survive"
is haunting you
everywhere you go.
-Is that true?
-Yes,
like, literally everywhere I go,
like, it could be a gas station,
grocery store, anywhere,
it just happens to come on.
Listen, if I were you two,
I would seize the moment.
I would record another song.
I would s--call it
"I Didn‘t Survive."
You know?
It‘d be a huge hit.
But seriously, there are
no losers on "Drag Race."
Dax, what‘s life been like
since you were on the show?
Honestly, life
has been absolutely amazing.
Like, the fans
have been phenomenal.
I mean, obviously, like,
I don‘t have as many fans as,
like, you know, Kim Chi
or Bob or Naomi.
That‘s fine.
It‘s fine,
but the ones
I do have are phenomenal.
Now, I‘ve got a confession
to make.
Laila McQueen
and I have a secret past.
I deny it, but there‘s proof.
Take a look.
[groans]
That little pixie to the right
of me is Laila McQueen
when I was not
running for president
in Manchester, New Hampshire.
You know, my grandmother
calls you Ron Paul.
[laughter]
Now, did you ever
imagine at that point
that you would be on this stage?
Oh, absolutely not.
I mean, I was performing in,
like, function halls
and Mexican restaurants.
Like, I never imagined being
here or anywhere else
around the world.
So now, what‘s happened
to you because of "Drag Race"?
I get to go everywhere
and meet the people
that love the work I do
and embrace so much love
that I never thought
I would see.
All that at the truck stop?
[laughter]
So Dax, Laila,
you aren‘t just surviving.
-You are thriving.
-Thank you.
Next up,
straight from Santee Alley,
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Now, since the show,
you‘ve been through it,
haven‘t you, girl?
Yes, actually the episode
that I been eliminated,
I was experience symptoms.
I‘m here to celebrate that.
-Wow.
-Yes.
And how do you feel right now?
I‘m in the discharge process
already right now,
so I feel amazing.
-I feel fantastic.
-Good. Yeah.
Did any of your drag sisters
reach out to you?
Yes, one special person,
and it‘s Acid Betty.
- That Acid Betty?
- That Acid Betty.
Yeah, Acid Betty.
She came to visit me as soon
as she knew
that I was diagnosed.
She was taking care of me.
She was like, "Bitch,
you‘re not alone.
I got your back."
I think the positive attitude
from all my entire
new sisterhood
helped me to recovery
and helped me
to be more positive every day.
Wow.
I love it.
Well, Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
we are cuckoo for your cuckoo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now a queen
who always picks up when I call
and a badass
in total control of herself.
Let‘s take a look.
The beauty is here.
My name is Naysha Lopez.
I spend money.
I don‘t do drag on a dime.
Naysha Lopez, sashay away.
How soon can you get here?
Bitches, I‘m back!
Face, body, glamour.
Your ass is real?
Yes. Realness, boo.
This acid trip is all real.
My drag style is completely over
the top, punk unicorn realness.
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she‘s a bitch.
I‘m not gonna be unprepared
because of you, boo.
Acid Betty,
you‘ve taken us
on one wild trip.
Now, Naysha Lopez, Michelle
and I have a running bet, okay?
That ass of yours, is it real?
So listen, Ru, I--
[laughter]
I eat well.
I work out.
I have 10 ccs
of medical grade silicon.
I--no.
[laughter]
So on the show
you said your ass was real.
My ass is real.
However, have I had
some enhancements
to the body-ody-ody?
-Yeah.
-Yes, I have.
Ah.
[laughing]
Now, you missed
the Madonna runway storyline.
- Yes.
- What would you have worn?
I‘m a very creative person,
and what I had going on
was another kimono.
What?
What is it with these queens
and kimonos?
Naysha, thanks for gracing us
with your gorgeous beauty
and that booty twice.
Yes.
Next, Acid Betty.
Now, are you really here,
or am I having a flashback?
Now, you turned out some killer
looks this season.
-[crowd whooping]
-Thank you.
How have fans been to you?
I love the fans.
They are the best, the best.
The best thing
of this show are the fans.
The love is so intense,
and it‘s wonderful.
I actually had a kid
that I met at DragCon,
and they decided that
they were gonna go into fashion
and got a full
scholarship to FIDM
because of seeing me
on the TV show.
-Wow. Wow.
-That‘s really great.
Now, Acid Betty,
you took a lot of heat
for your Nancy Grace
impersonation,
but some people really,
really liked it.
Take a look.
Acid Betty,
I loved watching you be me,
but frankly,
speaking professionally,
you got a raw deal.
You were robbed.
No tea, no shade,
but unleash the lawyers.
We got a case here.
-That‘s fierce.
-I love it.
Aci, I could go
on talking to you all night,
but I refuse
to say anything further
until I lawyer up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Acid Betty.
Now, the best way to describe
our next three queens
is brassy, Brooklyn,
and Britney, bitch.
Good morning.
My name is Robbie Turner,
and I‘m the kindest queen
you‘ll ever meet.
♪ I want you to be hot
and saucy ♪
♪ ♪
-Yes, Marilyn.
-She‘s in a league of her own.
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.
-Oh!
-Oh!
Too real?
Whoo! Thorgy
with a T-H and orgy,
and I feel incredible.
I‘m colorful.
I‘m fun,
and I‘m a fashion clown.
This is harder on me
than it is for you guys.
No, it‘s not.
<i>-[Thorgy] I can be campy,</i>
<i>but also I can be,</i>
<i>like, fucking fierce.</i>
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.
Yes!
It‘d Derrick, bitch.
<i>-[Derrick] I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>
I also have a career
with my wigs on.
You‘ll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.
You have to give us more.
That is not a Britney reference.
-Oh!
-Oh!
That‘s how you go out
in style, girls.
Now, Robbie Turner,
how does someone so young know
so much about classic Hollywood?
My mother and father
wouldn‘t allow us to watch
contemporary films,
so we watched
classic Hollywood films
all the time, so I thought
they were contemporary.
So you can imagine
little baby Robbie
when she‘s like, "Judy Garland
died many moons ago,"
and it‘s like, "What?"
Now, what was your favorite
moment on the show?
On my birthday
I won the singing challenge
with the le chicken wings,
and Debbie Harry came back
and said happy birthday to me.
I‘m like, um,
I don‘t see the problem
with this birthday at all--
"Drag Race,"
Debbie, chicken wings.
[laughter]
Robbie, thank you so much
for all the classic sass.
Oh, and by the way,
I will be sending you a bill
for that broken light bulb
that you did.
Uh-huh.
Up next, hey, there,
Thorgy girl.
Hey, Ru.
Yeah!
[cheers and applause]
Now, like Michelle and I,
you and Bob
have a very complicated
relationship.
Tell me about it.
I love to argue
and fight about everything.
I love it.
There‘s always a way
to tear things apart
and make them better.
Bob can take it from me.
He‘ll just listen
to me talk and go,
"I still don‘t like you."
[laughter]
But when people see me
and Bob doing that,
they‘re like, "Oh, you guys
really don‘t like each other."
I‘m like, "I just love
fighting with him so much,"
but I‘m just in love
with Bob very much.
Now, you have dreams
of starting a thorchestra?
-Is that right?
-Yeah.
What is a--what‘s
a thorchestra?
Well,
ever since I was playing violin
and then I got into,
like, the art of drag,
I wanted to conduct, like,
a 40-piece orchestra.
I wanted to travel the world.
I want, like, Rufus Wainwright
to wheel out on a piano
and be like, "Oh,
my friend Rufus
is here to sing a song."
That‘s a great idea.
Will you play a little something
for us right now?
Sure.
Oh, my God!
[laughter]

[high notes]
[cheers and applause]
Thank you, guys.
Well, Thorgy,
I cannot wait to see
what you‘re gonna do next.
Whoo!
Up next, the 100th queen
to prance into
my workroom--
♪ Hey, Derrick ♪
Whoo!
Now, you struggled to get
out of the Britney box,
-as it was called.
-Yes.
What‘s your relationship
with Britney now?
I will always do Britney.
I‘m not leaving that behind.
Of course I wanted
to come on the show
to expand what I already do
and take it to the next level,
and I feel like not only can I
do Britney now, I can do drag.
I‘m doing drag right now.
Now, Derrick,
throughout the season
you were not afraid
to speak your mind loudly,
especially with Bob and Naomi.
You have any regrets about that?
Everything?
Oh, gosh, it‘s hard
because I watch it back,
I‘m like, "Oh, wow,
I shouldn‘t have said that.
Probably shouldn‘t have had
that drink and untucked,"
[laughter]
and yes,
I have a hard time
taking criticism
because I‘ve never been
criticized like that before.
Doing Britney was
what I‘ve always done,
and I was praised for that,
and now coming
into this competition
it was almost looked down
upon that that was something
that I was known to do.
And I learned so much
from Naomi,
and she taught me
how to block my brows,
and I think I‘m doing it now.
Thank you, Derrick,
and I will always think of you
as my genie in a bottle.
Yes, I know
that‘s a Christina song,
but I‘ve run
out of Britney references!
-Give me a break.
-Yes.
We love you, Derrick Barry.
[laughing]
Now, we are moments
away from finding out
if Bob The Drag Queen, Kim Chi,
or Naomi Smalls will be crowned
America‘s next drag superstar,
but first the queen
who has turned this season
on its head.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>Laissez les bon temps roulez.</i>
<i>My name is Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>and I don‘t get ready.</i>
I stay ready.
[snapping]
<i>-[Chi Chi] My drag is that</i>
<i>real southern dragged out style</i>
<i>of drag.</i>
<i>Prove to us</i>
<i>that you‘re a champion.</i>
<i>Not only have you guys</i>
<i>taught me how to be</i>
<i>a better entertainer,</i>
but you have taught me
how to be a better person,
and $100,000 cannot buy that.
[snaps]
Yes, Louisiana glamour.
When you came to "Drag Race,"
you had quit two jobs
to be on the show.
How many jobs do you have now?
I have one job, Ru,
and I‘m a full-time drag queen!
That‘s what‘s up.
That‘s what‘s up.
How do fans
react when they meet you?
Oh, my God, first time in
New York, I‘m in Times Square,
and the shortest little
Hispanic woman
stopped me in the street,
and she just instantly
start crying.
-Wow.
-She explained it to me
that I represented
all of the people
in the world to her
that are out there
struggling to make ends meet
and who have a dream,
and the dream has come true.
Dreams come true, y‘all.
Dreams come true.
And speaking of dreams,
the "Dreamgirls" lip sync
that you did,
oh, honey,
that was legendary,
and I‘m not the only one
who thought so.
Take a look at this.
<i>You, Miss Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>are a true inspiration.</i>
<i>I tell you</i>
<i>that your heartfelt rendition</i>
<i>of "And I‘m Telling You"</i>
<i>moved me,</i>
<i>and honey, when those bees</i>
<i>start flying right</i>
<i>after you and I hit</i>
<i>our high note, honey,</i>
<i>you gave me life,</i>
<i>and I‘m gonna make you</i>
<i>an official Dreamgirl.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Do you have anything else
you‘d like to say?
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
You have changed
my life forever.
Thank you.
You made my dreams come true.
That is the sweetest thing.
I really appreciate that.

Yeah,
it was you being a bitch.
Well, this is my second week
in the bottom three.
I am so happy to still be here.
I was in shock
that it was not you lip-syncing.
It was Naysha.
[Derrick] But Chris and Debbie
thought I stood out.
Chris was like, "I think
you could impersonate Debbie.
And we'll take you out on tour."
They may have been on drugs.
I want a drug test.
Yeah,
I didn't hear you get that.
-But--
-I did get told
that my performance

Which you didn't get told.
All right.
Derrick, I think
you just missed the point,
-but it's not a big deal.
-Okay.
Well, I don't know
if there was a point.
It's just Bob talking
is your point all the time.
But you'll do, like,
side shady comments,
and it's funny,
but when I do side shady

-No. No, but what you--

It'll be, like, five minutes.
Lord have mercy.
The two of you, honey.
That is a pot boiling.
Derrick's, like,
"I ain't never
make jokes about anyone ever."
Hey, Bob.
If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,
can you give me any tips?
Ooh hoo hoo!
If you want to do, like,
memorable drag next week,
-I can give you some tips.
-[laughs]
So all I need to do
is not wear a wig
and I'll be told by
the judges that I'm pretty.
-Babe.
-Didn't I remind you guys?
I said, "In about five minutes,
she'd make a shady comment
out of nowhere"?
And I did.
What I said wasn't meant
to hurt your feelings.
You're trying to be spiteful.
You see the difference?
Your intentions
weren't to hurt me?
No, they weren't to hurt.
If I wanted to hurt you,
you'd be cryin'
right now, bitch.
I will never cry
over you at all.
Don't give me a challenge.
I work on the strip with
really big drag personalities.
So if you think
you're gonna come for me,
I am not that innocent.

<i>There's nothing to it.</i>

[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Wow.
Ladies.
For this week's maxi challenge,
we're going to break
out of the studio
as we drive
along the Hollywood freeway
looking for fresh roadkill.
Then, back in the workroom,
you'll need to transform
the furry little pelts
into evening gowns
that scream
"#CritterCouture."
Oh, hell,
who am I kiddin'?
It's time to play
the Snatch Game.
[cheers and applause]
[laughing]
#SnatchGame.
Now, you know how it works.
Impersonate a celebrity,
fill in the blanks,
and stake your claim
as a front-runner
in this competition.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[applause]
Who you doin', baby?
I was gonna do Nancy Grace.
Which is brilliant by the way.
-Yeah, I think it's funny.
-Because she's so, so funny.
-Over the top. Right.
-Oh, she's the craziest.
And just have outrage
at every--everything.
Every corner.
I'm impersonating
Nancy Grace, herself,
because she seems
like a major bitch,
and I can relate to that.
Robbie,
what are you thinkin' about?
-I'm doing Diana Vreeland.
-Who?
She was the first
editor in chief
-of "Vogue" in the '60s.
-Oh.
Do you think
that's a hair obscure?
No.
Not at all.
I have been practicing
Diana Vreeland for months.
Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme,
my Seattle sister wives,
won Snatch Game each year
that they were on.
So there's a lot
of pressure on me to be great.
What character
are you doing?
Well, I was going
to do Whoopi Goldberg.
"The Color Purple" is, like,
one of my favorite movies.
And it's so quotable.
Everyone knows
"The Color Purple."
-Yeah.
-I've been working on it
since I found out I was gonna
be on the show.
And I cannot wait to be able
to prove that I am a performer.
I'm not just a runway queen.
Who are you doing?
I'm torn
between Whoopi Goldberg,
Uzo Aduba,
who is an actress on, um,
-"Orange Is The New Black"...
-Oh, yeah.
And my last choice
is probably my favorite,
but I look the least like her,
is Carol Channing.
Why would you do--well.
<i>I know some folks</i>
<i>are gonna question</i>
why is a 6'2" black man
doing Carol Channing, but it's
because I feel a connection
with Carol Channing.
-I really do.
-See, isn't this not--
-Miss Celie?
-[laughs]
You really do look like
Miss Celie.
I sure is ugly.
I want to show you how much
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.
So Bob basically has,
like, ten characters
that he could possibly do.
All the sudden, he's got
the "Sister Act" outfit on.
He is, like, really giving
that Whoopi look.
I think that if you hit a man,
a man has the right
to knock you out.
You don't want
to get hit by a man,
don't go around hittin' people.
That's all I'm sayin'.
This is gonna
be the Whoopi Game
instead of the Snatch Game.
I'm realizing,
"Oh, shit.
I might be out
of my league here."
So I'm gonna have to go
with my plan B backup.
Bob is so excited
for Snatch Game,
that he's changed
his character, like, 90 times.
I think these
are the moves
you got to do
to be Uzo Aduba.
But the brightest bulbs
have a way of dimming suddenly
or just going out.
Today's challenge--
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Is gonna be Snatch Game.
<i>It's a celebrity impersonation,</i>
<i>so you have</i>
<i>to make people laugh.</i>
So I'm gonna be busier
than a one-legged cat
in a sandbox tryin'
to win this challenge.
Hey, celebrities.
[all] Hey!
Are you ready
to snatch my attention?
[all cheer]
-Hi, Chi Chi.
-Mama Ru.
[laughs]
Who are you doing?
-I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.
-Uh-huh.
How are you gonna make
Eartha funny?
Um, I know
that she played Catwoman
and I have two cats at home.
I'm just gonna play off--
Well, that--there it is!
You've got two cats at home.
To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,
and you've got to make me laugh.
-Yeah.
-All right. See you out there.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Hi, Kim Chi.
Have you decided on what
character you're gonna portray?
Um, there's two characters
I'm debating between.
First one is...Pearl.
Is there something on my face?
[laughs]
I started doing drag
with Pearl,
<i>who was on season 7,</i>
<i>so I know her quirks</i>
<i>really well.</i>
Right. Right.
And who's your other character?
The other one
is kind of obscure.
-Uh-huh.
-Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.
-Kimmy?
-Kimmy, yeah.
Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,
but if I turn
the North Korean dictator
into a drag version of him,
it would be a chance
<i>for me to show</i>
<i>another side of Kim Chi</i>
that's a little fucked up.
Huh.
That's interesting.
Listen, whatever works for you.
Just so long as
you make me laugh.
Kimmy Jong-what?
<i>A made-up character,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>
I really hope that
lands her in the bottom.
<i>-♪ Hey, Derrick ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Hey, Ru ♪</i>
Are you gonna do Brittney?
It's an obvious choice.
But this is my chance
to show everyone
that I'm more than
-just a Brittney impersonator.
-Uh-huh.
And so
I think I'm gonna go
with Laura Bell Bundy's
character.
Yes,
she's the country singer
-Broadway star.
-Right.
And she made up
all these characters,
and Shocantelle
-is my favorite one.
-Uh-huh.
She is a black girl
trapped in a white girl's body.
Ah.
Can I see a little bit
of your Laura Bell Bundy
character?
Hello, RuPaul.
I am here.
My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.
You know, sometimes
the most obvious thing
is the thing to do.
You just have to decide
where you want to go.
Stakes are high.
There's $100,000 on the line.
Yeah, that's true.
-All right, Derrick.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Oh, Lord.
-Thorgy Thor.
-That's me.
Wait a minute, let me see.
I'm getting, uh,
-Charles Manson.
-No.
-No?
-Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.
How are you gonna make
Michael Jackson funny?
His little quirks.
His little movements
that I have down.
Yeah.
Who's your biggest
competition here?
You know, I'm gonna say Bob.
You know, what you're asking us
to do in this season,
Bob is really excelling at,
which is pissing me off.
Well, let me tell you this,
Thorgy.
And this might help you.
You second-guess
and you take it into your head.
-Constantly.
-This is an opportunity
for you to feel confident
going with your gut
and not overthinking things.
-Yeah.
-All right, Thorgy.
-I'll see you out there.
-Okay.
All right, ladies.
Gather round.
Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is
"Night of 100 Madonnas."
[all cheer]
Madonna has so many
iconic looks.
<i>I can't wait to see</i>
<i>what everybody comes up with.</i>
It's gonna be amazing.
So express yourself,
'cause it's a celebration.
-[all cheer]
-So don't fuck it up.
-Holiday.
-Bye.
Bye, Ru.
<i>[drum roll, triumphant music]</i>
Welcome to Snatch Game!
Let's meet
our supermodel contestants.
"Vogue" cover girl Chanel Iman.
Hey.
[laughs]
And "Sports Illustrated"
bombshell Gigi Hadid.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, darling.
I'm so excited.
Are you ready
to meet our stars?
-We are.
-Yes.
First up, the king of pop,
Michael Jackson.
Was Billie Jean
really your lover?
I love everyone.
[scatting]
-The king of pop is here.
-[giggles]
Next, we have the sister
of the supreme leader
of North Korea, Kimmy Jong-un.
Anyoung haseyo.
[laughs]
Oh, my goodness.
I just know my emails
are gonna get hacked
after this show airs.
You know what I mean?
[laughs]
Next up, television host
and former prosecutor,
Nancy Grace is here.
-Hello, Nancy.
-You know,
I'm worried about
the children, RuPaul.
There's reefer smokers
influencing them every day.
All right.
All right.
Up next, legendary "Vogue"
fashion editor,
Diana Vreeland.
RuPaul!
What's in this season, Diana?
How the hell should I know?
Up next, reality superstar,
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.
New York is in
the mutha-fuckin' house.
[laughs]
Up next,
Eartha Kitt is here.
How are you?
You're not wearing
any panties, are you?
Who wears panties?
What are those?
All right, up next,
Britney Jean Spears is here.
I don't wear panties either.
You don't
wear panties either?
Especially when I get
out of cars.
[laughter]
All right.
From "Orange Is The New Black",
Uzo Aduba is here.
Don't say anything stupid.
Don't say anything stupid.
Uh, how you doin', RuPaul?
Are you ready
to play the game?
I'm excited.
I don't know
why you all gaggin'.
She bring it to you
every season.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.
Welcome back to Snatch Game.
Here's how the game works.
I ask a question,
and you give an answer
that you think will match
our supermodel contestants.
[giggles]
First question.
Gigi Hadid.
There's a new dating app
for drag queens.
When you join,
the first question they ask
is, "How big is your blank?"
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.
How big is your wig?
I love that!
Let's go to our superstars
and find out
if you got any matches.
Okay.
Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un
from North Korea.
The first question
they ask is, "How big is your"?
I wrote down
weapons of ass destruction.
Weapons of ass destruction.
Not a match.
[laughing] I--yeah.
Well, thank you,
the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un.
Ms. Eartha Kitt.
Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...
[laughter]
But I said,
"Big furry balls."
How big is your big
furry balls?
Honey, get your mind
out of the gutter.
Of course.
-[laughing]
-[purring]
Prosecutor Nancy Grace.
Well, as everybody knows,
not only do I do newscasting,
but I also was on another show
where I danced.
So I said, "How big
are your bunions?"
What do you do for bunions?
Well, I was told
you can get 'em shaved off.
That's what they do.
I'm about to get that done.
All right.
Sorry, Gigi.
Not a match.
Let's move on to
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.
How big is your clock?
Because drag queens
love a big-ass clock, right?
[feeble laughter]
Ru seems to be throwing Naomi
every bone she can find.
Do you like a big clock,
yourself?
But this dog won't catch.
Chanel Iman.
It's your turn now, darling.
The big bad wolf
is a drag queen.
Instead of huffing,
and puffing,
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.
Shakes?
She gonna shake
the house down.
Shake that ass.
Mm.
All right, well,
let's go to our celebrities
and find out
if you've got a match.
Let's start
with Latoya's brother,
Michael Jackson.
I just said,
"Takes a long nap
in a bed
with everyone they know."
-Michael, that's crazy.
-Thank you.
[laughter]
Mm-hmm.
Let's move on
down to Diana Vreeland.
I used to work
for "Vogue" magazine.
But I heard that now
"Vogue" means a dance.
So I think they vogue
the house down.
Girl.
This performance is poo.
And you're from the same town
as Jinkx and Dela?
Ooh, girl.
Them girls is gonna--
I was about to say
they gonna hang you,
but I ain't gonna say that.
[laughs]
Eartha Kitt.
Instead of huffing, puffing
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.
She licks the house.
Ooh.
Licks the house down.
And speaking of lick,
it's time for my bath.
What?
Oh, you--
[laughs]
[giggles]
[laughter]
Ha, ha.
That's what cats do.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Eartha Kitt
didn't do that, Chi Chi.
Let's move on down
to Britney Jean.
She reads the house down.
That's not a match,
unfortunately, Chanel Iman.
But has Eartha Kitt
got your tongue?
I've had that tongue before.
-You have?
-Good girls gone bad.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
You should do
that one more time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I would be very
popular in prison.
[laughter]
All right.
Crazy Eyes.
[laughs]
Because you pretty,
I just wrote a poem...
-Yeah.
-To Iman.
A-Once a queen named Iman
remind me of the Sun.
Instead of her
supermodel life,
She can be...
my wife.
[laughter]
Unfortunately, Chanel,
that is not a match.
Next question.
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.
Lady Bunny has an unusual way
of celebrating gay pride.
Instead of the rainbow flag,
she hangs her blank
out the window.
Her tucking panties.
Let's go to the king
of pop and hear
if you have a match.
Oh, Ru.
It's not a match,
but I said, "She waves
her blanket."
-Say "Hi."
-Oh, hi, Blanket.
-Hi, Blanket.
-Hi, hi. Bye-bye.
Oh, please be careful.
You don't want Blanket to fall.
-No.
-Oh, thank you.
Yes.
[scatting]
Moving on down
to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.
When I think of Pride,
I think of...my hair.
So I said $800 weave?
That's an $800 weave?
Well, of course.
Blended.
Yes.
Yes.
<i>Naomi's "New York"?</i>
I'm sorry, Gigi.
You didn't get
a match this time.
Maybe next time.
Well, look who's here.
I'm sorry
that I'm late.
But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo
left the stage
and she asked me
if I would fill in.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Carol Channing.
Oh, thank you.
[laughter]
All right.
Chanel Iman.
Sally the Supermodel
is so lactose intolerant,
when the photographer
says, "cheese," she blanks.
-Sneezes.
-She sneezes!
Let's go down to Nancy Grace.
She sends out an Amber Alert.
Nancy Grace is terrible.
It's important
to keep the children
safe from the boozers
and the users
and the reefer smokers.
<i>It's lifeless.</i>
It's basically Acid Betty
turned into Boring Betty.
Let's move on down
to Britney Spears,
the princess of pop.
She, "Oops.
I did it again."
-Ahh.
-[giggles]
Do you mean
between me down there?
She had diarrhea.
[laughter]
All right,
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.
I've worked with Sally
for so long.
She pops a pill, RuPaul.
She pops a pill.
There is so much talk
about drugs.
I have-haven't taken
anything but Lipitor
for the past ten years.
You don't really
get a buzz off of that.
Now, is there an anal option?
I might happen to have a Fleet
or two in my home.
A Fleet enema.
Now you're talkin'
my language.
If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.
By the way, Eartha,
I didn't know
that was you down there.
-It's me, darling.
-From here,
I couldn't tell if you were
Della Reese or Luther Vandross.
I couldn't see.
These aren't even
my good glasses.
But back to
the matter at hand.
I just wrote "corn".
-That's always a good answer.
-You know, there's no dairy.
And it comes out the way
you put it in, RuPaul.
Well, listen.
On that note, I am sorry, folks,
but we are well out of time.
It was a really
close game,
but the winner is...
[drum roll]
Charo!
<i>[record scratches]</i>
[screaming]
[lively music]
She won!
-I win!
-You won!
She won!
[screaming]
[laughs]
Mwah!
What?
I can't believe she--
[laughter]
Always the first.
<i>It's elimination day,</i>
and it is the
Night of the 100 Madonnas.
And as I'm pulling out
my kimono,
I see Thorgy's also
pulling out a red kimono.
Great minds think alike?
In New York, it's funny.
It's like we're always put
in these boxes of, like,
what people's expectations
of who we are as, you know,
-drag artists?
-Yes.
Now, even people
are putting Brooklyn in a box.
Brooklyn doesn't accept me.
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of queens at home</i>
<i>who do not interact with me.</i>
It sucks that none of them
ask me to be a part
of their community.
So I don't fit in anywhere.
There are certain definitions
of "drag."
You know, and there's,
like, "I'm put in it 'cause
I'm the 'look queen.'"
I've had fights
with those people
where they're like, "Oh,
you're not a drag queen.
-You just do looks."
-Yes. Mm-hmm.
<i>It hurts me, actually,</i>
<i>that I'm a lone soldier.</i>
And I think
that's that huge wall
that I put in between me
and myself and everybody else.
I think this show's
a great platform, though,
because it kind of shows
that we do something more
than just stand around
-and serve booze.
-Yup.
You know, or sit around
and be a bitch.
Yeah.
You know,
I do all these shows.
I make all these things.
But I'm also a musician.
What I really want to do is,
like, do a grand,
like, event,
like, "Thorgy
-and the Thorchestra."
-Fabulous.
Like, a 40-piece orchestra,
and I want to conduct in drag.
<i>I am a professional violinist,</i>
<i>violist, cellist.</i>
<i>You know, I've played</i>
<i>at Carnegie Hall many times.</i>
<i>I feel like I'm</i>
<i>the perfect medium</i>
<i>to kind of appeal to, like,</i>
<i>the younger generation</i>
and make Classical music cool.
It's a throwback to, like,
events where, like,
you dressed up just to get
on the red carpet.
I love that.
Do you have any siblings, Bob?
I have two brothers, actually.
-Uh-huh.
-How many do you have?
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.
-You said you were adopted?
-Yeah.
Did they have a talk where
they were, like, "You know--"
Where they went, like, one day,
like, "Well, just so you know."
Well,
it's--like it's very obvious
that I'm adopted.
These are my parents.
So growing up
with white parents.
A rainbow family.
Like, this is my mom.
She's gorgeous.
Yeah, she's, like,
the best mom ever.
I'm literally the only gay one
in my family.
<i>And I have</i>
<i>a Christian background,</i>
<i>and I've heard stories of kids</i>
<i>being shunned from the family</i>
<i>and all that.</i>
<i>And my mom has done nothing</i>
<i>but make me feel accepted.</i>
And, she's just
an amazing woman.
I love my mom.
Growing up, I literally had,
like, the best parents
and best childhood.
Did you ever feel a--a need
to just study up on black stuff?
Kind of.
It wasn't a weird thing
until I got to high school,
middle school.
People were throwing out
all these, like,
black references.
And I was, like, "Wait.
What does that mean?"
Did you grow up with,
like, black culture
was, like, second-hand?
I grew up
in an all-black family.
I went to all-black high school,
all-black elementary school
and a majority
black middle school.
Like, I get called "Oreo,"
like, all the time.
-It's obnoxious.
-Or, like, "Oh,
he's kind of cute
for a black guy."
Oh, don't even get me started
on being cute for a black guy.
It's kind
of a--it's really obnoxious.
Wait, I think you're kind
of cute for a black guy, Naomi.
Thank you, Kimberly Chi.
Kind of, though.

-[Carson] Kung fu fightin'.
-[Michelle] This is, like,
the Victoria's
Secret section of Madonna.
[Carson] I like that material,
girl.
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
She's keepin' her baby.
It may have a few holes
in it, but--
[laughter]
<i>My Madonna look today</i>
<i>is from "Bedtime Stories,"</i>
<i>where she's pregnant,</i>
<i>giving birth to doves.</i>
<i>This outfit</i>
<i>represents who I am,</i>
<i>because obviously</i>
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>creative enough to think of it.</i>
[RuPaul] I think she just
flipped us the bird.
[Michelle] Bye, bye, birdie.
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.
[Michelle] She's in a league
of her own.
[RuPaul] There's no crying
in baseball, Robbie!
<i>I feel so cute.</i>
<i>I've got my cute little dress.</i>
<i>It's all hand-painted</i>
<i>with my little patches.</i>
[RuPaul] I wonder if she's
a pitcher or a catcher.
[Michelle] Me too.
[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.
You're gonna poke somebody's
eyes out with those things.
[Michelle] If you're lucky.
<i>When you think of Madonna,</i>
<i>you think of the cone bra.</i>
<i>-Bitch, I look good.</i>
<i>-[RuPaul] Oh, yeah.</i>
It's--she's totally
expressing herself.
I think she likes
a little hanky-panky.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-[Michelle] Oh!
[RuPaul] Not to be confused
with Bob the camp counselor.
[Chanel] I love.
<i>My favorite Madonna look</i>
<i>is Madonna at the GLAAD Awards</i>
<i>when she dressed</i>
<i>like a boy scout.</i>
<i>And it is a huge</i>
<i>political statement.</i>
<i>And I'm not in a kimono!</i>
[RuPaul] Get a load
of those Girl Scout cookies.
[Michelle] Yes!
[RuPaul] And she earned a badge
for walking children in nature.
[laughter]
<i>♪ The realness ♪</i>
Welcome, ladies.
When I call your name,
please step forward
and strike a pose.
[whispers indistinctly]
Kim Chi.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
You're both safe.
Thank you.
You may leave the stage.
Oh, the power of good-bye.
[laughs]
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Tonight
on the runway,
I don't know
if you guys had some kind of
symbiotic message
to each other,
but there's a lot of kimonos
which is very interesting.
Thorgy, you did your take on it.
You kept it in geisha,
but still Thorgy's in there.
The Michael Jackson
was so good.
I loved all of it.
You kept character
better than anyone.
It was everything for me.
[laughs]
Up next, Acid Betty.
I was not expecting
to see "Bedtime Stories"
and the whole
bird-fly-out thing.
-So kudos to that.
-Thank you.
I think your make-up
is okay tonight.
It's nothing spectacular.
But where I was really let down,
was in the Snatch Game, Betty.
It didn't look like her.
It was like the wig
and the make-up,
you were like
a white Chaka Khan.
I didn't get
any Nancy Grace from it.
It felt like
you were just being you.
It was just a fail
all the way around.
I wasn't sure how to turn
such a serious woman funny.
I needed like a nasal,
angry southern voice.
And then she leans in,
and she wants to talk
to you on the TV
like she's in your living room.
[laughter]
I wish I had you as a coach.
Okay.
All right.
Up next, Robbie Turnter.
I really enjoyed your catwalk
because it was really fun
and playful.
I was really excited
about Diana.
And I--I think that most people
may not know who that is.
So I think that
how iconic she was,
and the voice and everything,
you kind of have to shove
that in people's faces
for them to get it.
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.
Punk took my voice away.
My voice kept cracking,
and I was going in and out
during Diana Vreeland.
Well,
we could hear you perfectly.
It's just, we weren't impressed
with what was being said.
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
It's becoming quite
predictable
for Naomi to come out
in basically, lingerie.
This is where we go, "Oh, maybe
I should switch it up now."
In Snatch Game,
I got lost with the boobs.
I think if you would have just
stuffed it to the max,
it would of made the character
a lot more obvious to me.
That was your moment
to go O-T-P.
I was very underwhelmed
with my performance.
It was not coming out,
and I'm, like,
so embarrassed about it.
All right.
Thank you, Naomi.
Up next, Derrick Barry.
So we did Britney, huh?
I am so grateful.
Oh, God.
You done good, girl.
Me and Gigi really,
really loved your
Britney performance yesterday.
You kept character
the whole time.
-You just were Britney.
-Thank you so much.
[RuPaul] Thank you, Derrick.
Bob The Drag Queen.
Tonight, on the runway.
Love it.
I love your Madonna look too.
And I know you're
a<i> huge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Madonna fan.</i>
And, like, one of
your biggest thing you said,
was when Madonna sent you,
like, a cease and desist?
-Yes!
-[laughs]
-Best moment of my life.
-[laughs]
The padding.
It's so good,
I wouldn't have known.
You are serving "womana."
This old luscious body.
The Snatch Game.
Uzo Aduba, amazing.
You were so good.
Then, we get a little
Carol Channing.
You gave us extra,
which was wonderful.
I do want to caution you,
however.
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.
Just keep that in
the back of your mind.
Mm-hmm.
All right, ladies.
Well, I think
we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Now, just between us
material squirrels.
-[Michelle] [laughs]
-What do you think?
Thorgy Thor.
Her Michael Jackson,
I thought was divine.
She was really good
at making fun of things
that are a little taboo.
She stayed in character
the entire time.
I really felt
like Michael was there.
-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
-Her runway was very creative.
But her Nancy Grace
was more like Nancy Disgrace.
Ooh, child.
How does a drag queen
do Nancy Grace
and she doesn't even
have the wig right?
You need a little
helmet-y blonde.
And then you need a few
little Nancy Grace-isms.
And none of that happened.
It was just like,
she didn't even know
who Nancy Grace was.
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.
The "League of Their Own" look
stood out from the rest.
-I would give it a B plus.
-We love Diana Vreeland.
We do, indeed.
Everything was wrong about it.
Why didn't she go
for the blown-back hair?
With the--
with the bump at the top.
Yes!
The worst part
of the whole thing tonight
with Robbie, was the--
[coughs feebly]
[whispers]
"I have no voice."
-Uh-huh.
-All of a sudden,
you don't have a voice anymore?
And I think she needs
to get out of her head
and get into my car.
Okay.
All right, Billy Ocean.
Naomi Smalls did
Tiffany Pollard. New York.
[Michelle] She didn't
do New York.
-She did not do New York.
-She wasn't New York.
She wasn't Connecticut.
She wasn't New Jersey.
She wasn't Long Island.
I don't know what she was.
But, Naomi's was my favorite
of the kimonos.
She made me want to wear it,
but I don't know
if it really screamed "Madonna."
[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.
The Britney blew me away.
I was so excited for every time
that she was going
to answer a question.
The runway thing,
I always find her a bit
timid on the runway.
When you're on the catwalk,
you've got to just
give it all you got.
You know, I once asked Iman
what is on her mind
on the runway.
And she looked at me dead
in the eyes and said, "Africa."
[laughs]
[Carson] That's what I do
when I go to bars.
-Oh, really?
-Yes. Think about Africa.
Oh-kerr!
Oh--
[trills, clicks tongue]
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
-She flipped the script.
Come back as an African-American
Carol Channing
doing a<i> fabulous</i>
<i>impersonation of her.</i>
-Right.
-And the Madonna thing,
it was the most
well put together
thought-out costume.
I didn't even know
leg pads were a thing.
There's a lot goin'
on on the stage
that would blow your mind, Gigi.
-Uh-huh.
-Show-and-tell backstage after?
Oh, I don't know
if you ready.
[laughter]
[claps]
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls...
[whispers]
Now.
Thorgy Thor.
Your Michael Jackson
was off the wall.
And your Madonna look
was something to remember.
Bob The Drag Queen.
I's was crazy
about your Snatch Game.
And on the runway,
you are one unapologetic bitch.
Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[applause]
You've won a collection
of handbags and wallets
from Lux De Ville
valued at $7,000.
Wow.
[all "oohing"]
[laughs]
Wow.
Whoo!
I took a risk, and it paid off.
Bob and Thorgy,
you may join the other girls.
Derrick Barry.
You are safe.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Acid Betty,
your runway was
an immaculate conception.
But your Nancy Grace
left us asking,
"Who's that girl?"
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
I totally agree
with Snatch Game.
It sucked.
But I think Snatch Game sucks.
Robbie Turner,
your runway was a hit.
But your Snatch Game
was a swing and a miss.
Naomi Smalls,
your runway look was borderline.
But your impersonation
of "New York"
bordered on "New Jersey."
Naomi Smalls.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Robbie Turner,
you are safe.
Thank you.
Two queens stand before me.
As always, I've consulted
with the judges.
But quite frankly,
I don't give a
fuck what they say.
Because the final decision
is mine to make.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life!

I'm not about to go home

<i>let go like this.</i>
-Fabulous.
-We did it.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Who's going first? Naomi.
-Yes.
-Okay.
(Naomi) So my platform
is being a supermodel,
and I want the whole world
to look beautiful.
And action.
America's drag president
is signing up for
speeches, debates, interviews--
Cut. Deliver it more.
Punch the words, you know?
Action.
America's first drag president
must speak as--
Fuck. Sorry.
Cut.
It's all about attitude.
This is a shady
political campaign.
I know
you know how to be shady.
[laughter]
Have you been watching
this season?
[laughs]
For my thing,
I'm using food as a metaphor,
and I'm smearing Naomi
by how skinny she is,
and we shouldn't trust her.
The biggest worry
I have for this challenge
is being able to speak clearly
and the judges being able to
understand my sense of "humor."
Here we go.
And action.
She acts like
she's the skinniest queen,
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.
More forcefully.
Remember to enunciate.
-All right.
-Action.
She acts like she's
the skinniest queen,
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.
Cut.
I think I'm seeing the words
as they're coming out of
your mouth, like, on paper.
Let that all go.
Let's move on.
Moving on.
Let's do the B-roll.
Action.
-What a fat ass.
-Cut.
The inflection
should go down at the end.
Not, "What a fat ass?"
But, "What a fat ass."
What a fat ass.
(both) What a fat ass.
What a fat ass.
You went up again.
I'm nervous for Kim
just because she did get
a lot of notes,
and she's not
feeling confident,
so I'm scared
that my friend could go home.
-Good, move on.
-Okay.
Thorgy Thor
and Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
I ain't gonna lie.
I'm a little nervous,
but I just want to present
in a professional way.
All right, Chi Chi,
you're up.
And action.
Thorgy Thor
is always caught looking
like she works
for children's parties.
Do you really want Bozo
running your country?
-I think not.
-Cut.
Okay, you sounded like
John Wayne,
which is really weird.
[laughs]
I say lose the deep voice.
It's a little too literal
and deadpan.
Like, it needs
a little bit of flair.
Yes.
You got that great
Louisiana accent.
I'm struggling with this
because where I'm from,
being country
is not the thing to be.
<i>I kind of want</i>
<i>to seem presidential.</i>
Damn.
Thorgy Thor for president.
Go for it, and give it
all you got.
I'm just gonna shorten it.
-Okay.
-All right.
And action.
My name is Thorgy Thor,
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president
of the United States of America.
[laughs]
Good job. Next scene.
Um...
[quietly]
"Freshmen year of college,
"threw up in the dorm.
[muttering indistinctly]
"She...
Comforts."
That's a better word.
Okay, let's hear it.
[laughs]
Read, lady.
Sorry.
No, I just like to kid.
(Chi Chi)
<i>Here we go again.</i>
Thorgy is changing ideas
as she's going along.
What is this?
What is that?
Ticktock, ticktock.
(Chi Chi)<i> She's just</i>
<i>all over the place,</i>
and it's pissing me off.
-It looks expensive.
-Focus, Thorgy. Focus.
-Sorry.
-And action.
Chi Chi's hand always
goes straight for the bottle..
-Great, cut. Perfect.
-That was excellent.
I think we got everything.
-No, B-roll now.
-Oh, yeah.
Fuck,
I forgot about all this.
All right, this
is gonna be simple.
-It's gonna be easy.
-(Michelle Visage) Action.
What are they gonna do
with canned food, by the way?
[Thorgy Thor chuckles]
Um...
Do you want a shot
of Chi Chi drinking booze?
'Cause you said her arm always
reaches for the booze.
-I think I'm good.
-You're done with Chi Chi?
Yeah, that's it.
Okay. Thank you, ladies.
<i>[lively music]</i>
Bring your ass up in here.
Walk into the club
with this purse.
-Bam.
-[laughter]
I'm gonna do my makeup
right away.
It's time to get
ready for today's runway:
black-and-white realness.
We are taking inspiration from
what Detox did on her season.
Are you really
doing all whiteface?
Yes.
Someone to finally stand up
for white people.
[laughter]
Bob, you're quite a political
person, if you will.
I like getting into politics.
It's actually fun.
<i>(Bob) My slogan is actually</i>
<i>my real-life slogan.</i>
Bob The Drag Queen:
a queen for the people.
I live my life by this.
I was in Albany,
in the capitol building,
when marriage equality passed.
In 2010, me and a couple
of my friends
decided to get together
and do something
about the inequalities
we experience
in the gay community,
<i>and we decided to do something</i>
<i>called Drag Queen</i>
<i>Weddings for Equality,</i>
<i>and we would do</i>
<i>these demonstrations</i>
<i>in Times Square</i>
<i>every single Saturday,</i>
until there was marriage
equality in New York state,
<i>(Bob) and I got arrested</i>
<i>at Bryant Park</i>
<i>for blocking traffic.</i>
<i>They fucking</i>
<i>threw my ass in jail,</i>
<i>in full drag, girl.</i>
Like, you don't have
to go get arrested
but just something,
something as simple as voting.
It is really important
because politicians,
they literally make very real
and very, very important
decisions for you.
Like, you could've done maybe
something about it
before it happened.
Well, you can definitely
do something about it.
So, Kim Chi.
Yes, Derrick Barry?
Did you grow up
in North or South Korea?
I grew up in--
[laughs]
You can't leave
North Korea.
It's not somewhere
where you, like--
-It's not a vacation spot.
-And if you leave,
like, your entire,
like, family,
your friends, like,
all of them will be killed.
I was born here in America,
and I went to elementary school
in South Korea.
Would you go back
to South Korea or no?
Oh, definitely, but there's
no drag culture there.
There's hardly
any gay culture.
Wow.
One day
I would love to be able
to perform in South Korea
and actually have people
come out to see me.
<i>(Kim Chi) I may be the first</i>
<i>Korean drag queen</i>
to ever be featured
on television.
Like, Americans
have it so good here.
They don't even
realize it, you know?
So true.
So, so true.

(RuPaul)
Welcome, candidates.
First up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
Let's take a look
at your shady political ad.
[claps]
Hi.
I'm Bob The Drag Queen,
a queen for the people.
And as a public servant,
I believe in serving the people.
That's why I want BJs
for every single American.
That's right, better jobs
for every American.
Buy yourself something pretty.
I believe in
strong drag family values.
I adopted these three
needy drag babies,
and Derrick Barry
only had one baby...
for breakfast.
<i>[eerie music]</i>
[laughter]
[chomping]
Bob The Drag Queen
has a plan...
the gay agenda--
and it's designed by lesbians,
so you know it works.
[laughter]
Bob The Drag Queen
for president.
Why?
Because I didn't
eat a fucking baby.
This ad was paid for
by my Uncle Steve.
He got money, girl.
[laughter]
I loved that
you threw so much shade
that you made your opponent
look like an absolute maniac.
You did an excellent job.
Strange.
You have a very small
amount of time
to tell your story,
to get the laugh.
I think it was tight,
and it worked.
You demonstrated gravitas.
I'm gonna throw
a challenge at you.
I would love to see
a fully-realized
glamasaurus Rex.
Okay.
All right, next up,
Derrick Barry.
Think Derrick Barry
because this fairy
thinks fairly.
As a Las Vegas local,
I'm comfortable taking
a gamble with your money.
However, Bob is only comfortable
stealing from defenseless people
on the mean streets
of New York City.
[cackles]
I'm a very traditional woman.
However, Bob spends
his time dropping acid
with his friend Betty
and engaging in orgies
with his friend Thorgy.
I'm gonna spend my time
incorporating drag 101 classes
in schools across America.
However, Bob visits
sick children in the hospital,
and instead of
making them laugh,
he laughs at them.
[laughing]
Who is Bob,
and what is he hiding?
[cackles]
This ad was paid for
by Chad Michaels,
All Stars Winner,
celebrity female impersonator
-of the world.
-[laughter]
-That was good, Derrick.
-Good job.
You came across
like you didn't really believe
what you were saying,
which is perfect
for a politician.
I mean, you nailed it.
It was Michele Bachmann
realness.
If you really were going
for Michele Bachmann, though,
you would've looked
at the wrong camera.
Baby,
the shade on your opponent,
it was dead-on.
You went in
on your competition.
It was an actual,
true smear.
Runway look,
a little underwhelmed.
Don't just give us that same
old kind of pretty makeup.
Just show us something
completely different.
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
Beauty is pain,
and I believe America
needs to toughen up.
A president needs to be
able to carry herself.
How is Kim Chi gonna do that
when she can't even
walk in heels?
[laughing]
America's first drag president
must give speeches,
interviews, and debates.
It's gonna be hard
to understand Kim Chi
when you're dodging saliva
through that strong lisp.
[laughter]
When I'm elected, there will be
no more parking tickets,
and officers will be trained to
give free injectable cosmetics.
Free Restylane for all!
I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise
to represent you fiercely.
[camera flashes]
This ad was paid for
by citizens
against non-lacefront wigs.
[laughter]
You made some campaign
promises
that really appeal to me.
[laughter]
I loved that
your commercial was really
all about being
a drag president,
about being fabulous.
Tonight on the runway, wow.
I mean, you look ultra
glamorous.
(Carson Kressley) And then
the hip with the padding.
Yeah, the padding
is phenomenal.
I think it's my favorite look
on the runway.
Thank you.
Up next, Kim Chi.
Let's take a look.
Hi, I'm Kim Chi,
and you want me
as your first drag president.
Naomi Smalls says
beauty is pain,
but is she aware of
the consequences of her actions?
America is a kitchen
that needs a strong chef
and never trust a skinny cook.
Small body, small mind.
She thinks she's
the skinniest queen,
but her waist is 22 inches.
What a fat ass.
Shady gays believe in no fats,
no fems, and no Asians.
As someone who is
all of the above,
I understand your pain.
My name is Kim Chi,
and say hello to yellow.
This ad was paid
out of my own pocket
because no one cares.
Do you?
[laughter]
When you came on,
you didn't break.
You did the whole mime thing.
But the best part
was your makeup.
Absolutely stunning.
But your ad.
I don't think it really got
the job done as far as
what the challenge was,
which was to be shady.
We did have
to work quite a bit
with you and your inflections.
-It was challenging.
-It was challenging.
It's just--I don't think
you're a big speaker.
I do have, like, a bit
of a fear of public speaking,
so to be able
to just enunciate clearly
is something I've struggled
with for a long time,
and I tried my best and--
Are you okay, boo?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I wouldn't be so hard
on myself if I were you.
It's just that you've got
some really tough competitors,
and we're down to that place
where we have to really
give harsh critiques, you know?
-Next up, Thorgy Thor.
-Hello.
Let's take a look
at your political shadiness.
Shoo.
Hello, good Americans.
My name is Thorgy Thor,
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president
of the United States of America.
You need somebody you can trust.
I've never told a lie,
and I'm not about to begin now.
This is my real hair.
My opponent Chi Chi DeVayne
once drank too many
wine coolers in college,
and she threw up on the floor.
Now she visits
recovering addicts
and feeds food to the homeless?
I'm not buying it.
Chi Chi's hand always
goes straight for the bottle.
My top priority is health care.
That's why I'm sending
a very expensive bottle
of champagne
to every home in America.
Cheers to
your health and mine.
[laughs]
Whoo!
Thorgy Thor for president,
because I'm more powerful
than you.
Hmm.
-[laughs]
-All right.
[applause]
Let's start
with your runway look.
It's not the most glamorous look
on the runway.
I think you look
like a dead Boy George.
I was very entertained
by your character.
I thought it was
a little Joan Crawford,
Faye Dunaway...
-Thank you.
-Over-the-top.
But I got totally confused
when you were
passing out the food,
and then you didn't see
anything about the booze,
and I was kind of--
I got a little lost on that.
Michelle even asked you,
"Don't you want to do, like,
a boozy cutaway of Chi Chi?"
And we never saw that.
And in an ad of this length,
you need to show us,
not tell us,
so that was a fail for me.
There was, like, no smear
in that smear campaign.
Also, there was no tagline,
like, no paid-for line.
The difficult thing
was to cut down
exactly what material
I wanted to come across
with this character.
There were too many ideas.
That's been
a critique of you
throughout the competition
is learning how to edit.
You're right.
I could keep--
I always just keep going,
keep going, and going.
It is difficult to shut
my thought processes down.
Thank you, Thorgy.
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.
Okay.
<i>I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>and I approve</i>
<i>this message, girl.</i>
I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,
and I should be
your next drag president
because I'm real, chill,
and my makeup don't peel.
<i>But my opponent Thorgy Thor</i>
<i>is always caught looking</i>
<i>like she works</i>
<i>for children's parties.</i>
<i>Do you really want a clown</i>
<i>running your country?</i>
<i>I think not.</i>
Meanwhile,
I'm working to ensure
that every American
has a pot to piss in
and a window to throw it out.
And in that same pot,
there'll be chitlins
boiling for all.
<i>Thorgy want America</i>
<i>to walk around</i>
<i>with horrible hip pads</i>
<i>that resemble Peggy Bundy.</i>
<i>Who wants to walk around</i>
<i>with a FUPA?</i>
America says,
"Not me, Thorgy Thor."
(voice)<i> This message</i>
<i>has been paid for</i>
<i>by citizens who like to eat</i>
<i>rare and unusual animal parts.</i>
-Oh!
-[laughter]
Well.
I really love
this sassy character.
However, your smear campaign,
you could've drug her ass
through the mud
a whole lot more,
is all I'm gonna
really tell you.
The look was a bit
shocking to me.
You're a drag queen president.
I didn't feel like there was
any "zjooshing" up.
You were, like,
rocking the Wanda Sykes
as assistant
in "Monster-in-Law" look.
I wasn't a fan.
I do think there really
wasn't any smear in there,
and I think for both of you,
you were too nice to each other.
Just remember
what the challenge is.
You came in
in kind of a character,
and I think we just had
to push you a little bit
for you to be in your skin.
And that's the key for you,
is to just own
that bayou charm.
[sighs]
Where I come from,
it's damn hard
to get out of the ghetto,
to get out of that,
and I think that's why I kind
of--I don't want to be ghetto.
You know what I mean?
Because I feel like--
Let me just tell you this.
Let me stop you here.
Just be you.
Honey, that's why we sent you
a plane ticket.
You know, we don't need you
to be somebody else.
I do want to say
that this my sixth season
doing this,
and I have not seen such
a strong set of girls before.
There is not one of you
that was terrible at all.
This is what
we're up against as judges.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
Just between us swing voters,
what do you think?
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob nailed it.
She's great at the comedy.
She was great at the writing.
She was great at the acting.
Bob had gravitas
in that campaign.
You are in love
with that word.
I still don't even
know what it means.
-I know, I want to--tell me.
-It means "heft."
Like a fat ass kind of heft?
Gravit-ass.
(RuPaul) Derrick Barry.
When she was Derrick Bachmann,
I think she smeared Bob,
and she smeared him well.
She had a really good, campy,
fun time with him.
Those two have a history
of being rivals,
and they made it
work for them.
This is like what
I do every week
with Michelle Visage.
[laughter]
Naomi Smalls.
She was the only one
that threw actual shade.
And she's so likeable.
Now, that runway,
she was padded for Jesus.
Gorgeous.
Naomi has risen
to the occasion,
and that's the kind of progress
we love in this competition.
(RuPaul) Kim Chi.
Her shade part
with Naomi was "eh."
I didn't know whether or not
she was doing a campaign ad
or if she was doing a food ad.
But this kid
is so imaginative,
and then she brought up
the no fats, no fems,
no Asians thing,
which was very political,
the fact that gay people
are fighting for fairness.
But, you know, on Craigslist,
you're free to be as racist
and body shaming as possible.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm gonna take that
off my profile.
[laughter]
(RuPaul)
Thorgy Thor.
This runway tonight
was a swing and a miss.
I know she's wacky
and different,
but it should be cohesive.
The political campaign,
love the commitment
to the character
but it was kind
of too much about her.
She didn't do any
of the smear campaign at all,
and when she did, it was like,
"Oh, enough about you
but back to me."
Lots of ideas,
but you've got to land a punch.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Tonight on the runway,
that is the best she's looked
this entire competition.
Unfortunately,
I was not a fan of
the political campaign.
That wasn't somebody
that could be
the first drag queen president.
When Chi Chi walked out
to meet Carson and I,
I literally though it was
James Brown coming out.
[laughter]
Silence.
Mm.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls,
Mr. Gorbachev!
Bob The Drag Queen
and Derrick Barry,
condragulations,
you are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

It's time to play
The Snatch Game!
-How you doing, RuPaul?

-Well, I was told that you can
get them shaved off.
I'm about to get that done.

quite predictable
to come out in lingerie.
Maybe you should
switch it up now.

-I need, like, a nasal,
angry Southern voice.
And she leans in like she's
in your living room.
-I wish I had you as a coach.

you are the winner

Naomi Smalls,

-What a day.

-"Ladies, you have been
touched by fierceness.
Bob, love you.
See Jew in New York."
-Betty has
the most iconic looks,
<i>and that's my Brooklyn girl.</i>
<i>But she was always just,</i>
<i>like, in a bad mood,</i>
<i>putting things down.</i>
She deserved to go.
-It was literally the worst
feeling I've ever felt.
I'm just very embarrassed
and disappointed in myself.
I let Ru down, and I know
that he's disappointed in me,
and that's like
the worst feeling ever.
I'm so scared now.
Feel like I have to wear, like,
a fucking turtleneck
that's to the floor.
-Was everything else you
brought here a bra and a panty?
-No.
-Two piece and a biscuit?
[laughter]
-I mean, I work hard
for my body and I love my body.
-I don't think the judges
are telling you
to be ashamed of your body.
I think they just
want to see one time
where you show them
something different.
-Where you wear clothing.
[laughter]
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] The other</i>
<i>queens think that what I do</i>
doesn't take a lot of effort,
and that's totally not true.
I put tons of work
into my drag aesthetic,
so it's frustrating.
Well, Bob, congratulations.
-Thank you.
-Yeah, congratulations, Bob.
-I had a lot of fun.
-Yeah.
-My reaction to Bob's win
is this...
Always.
I'm just, like, sick of it.
-I came in a close second,
though--they really liked me.
-I'm the first one to win two,
I won two!
I'm gonna try to get three.
Has anyone ever
won three before?
-Bob, shut up.
-I'm really proud of myself
and I feel like the other girls
are really gunning for me now.
They're like, "Oh, you think
you all that, bitch?"
<i>But I don't mean</i>
<i>to come across that way.</i>
I'm just having fun.
I'm just, like, living my dream,
making people laugh,

You may be from New York, honey,

I'd hit that baby one more time.

No one knows whether

no one's gonna be
calling you at all.

You say it takes you an hour

Why does it look

-Beauty.
-It is a known fact that
Derrick Barry is not very smart.
When she heard "Britney Spears,"
she said, "Does she?
I prefer fencing."

It is very hard to have
an intelligent conversation
with Derrick Barry.

is Robbie Turner's wig lines.

-So tell me, like, what's
your personal style like?
-It's very vintage.
-Me too.
-My wedding was a 1940s
vintage wedding dress.
<i>-Fabulous!</i>
<i>I love that.</i>
-Yeah.
-So, the Cowardly Lion.
We're gonna make, you know,
a cute little dress
or maybe a leotard
or I don't know.
I'm thinking.
-You have a big challenge.
-I do have a big challenge,
yeah.
-Oh, Robbie.
I agree with Christy.
<i>I think he's gonna</i>
<i>have a challenge,</i>
because based on
his poodle challenge
<i>a couple episodes ago,</i>
<i>Robbie's not the best</i>
<i>at construction,</i>
and especially with somebody
much smaller.
-So how do you fit
into your group?
'Cause here's the thing.
They're sick of me winning
all the time,
so they're all like,
"Ooh, Bob wins everything.
Everyone loves Bob."
In the first season of the show
there was a photoshoot
that we did,
And the photographer were giving
me all the attention
-Terra
-Who's Terra?
-The bitchy one.
-The one right here?
-Yeah.
-I can hear you.
-I mean, I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little nervous.
<i>I don't know if there's anyone</i>
<i>in "The Wizard of Oz"</i>
more the opposite of who I am
than Glinda the Good Witch.
And I think, honestly, a lot of
the girls want to see me do bad.
I am nervous!
-Why?
-You know you guys are all
fucking gunning for me to lose.
-Well, of course we are.
We just want you
to trip and fall, that's all.
-Ooh, hoo, hoo!
-Sometimes it's funny to watch
other people, like, squirm.
Especially Bob.
Too real?
-Our resources
are very limited.
-You know 'Masterchef"
competition. They only give
mustard and...
-But this ain't Masterchef...
They hate me they gotta give me
some...
You are not too worried about...
-I'm just worried about
being efficient.
<i>-[Chi Chi] I'm feeling a little</i>
<i>pressured about the outfits</i>
<i>today</i>
because so far the judges
seem to not like my style.
I keep saying that
I'm like the broke queen,
you know what I mean?
I just cannot get out
of my head.
-See, you can't do that.
Don't even claim that.
Don't even have that energy.
It ain't no "if."
It ain't "I'm trying,"
or "I can't."
No.
"I am,"
and "I'm doing it."
'Cause if I could do it,
you sure could do it.
-Mm-hmm.
-I didn't let
my height to get in my way
of my dreams.
Don't think small.
<i>-[Chi Chi] The lesson in "The</i>
<i>Wonderful Wizard of Oz" for</i>
<i>Dorothy</i>
is that she's searching for
something that she already has,
<i>so maybe I have</i>
<i>everything I need</i>
and I am a real-life Dorothy.
-Whatever you do,
I'ma wear it,
strut it,
and be confident in it, okay?
'Cause you know that's how
I roll.

-Hello, hello, hello!
both: Hi!
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hi, Kim Chi.
Hi, Briana.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hello.
-Now, Kim Chi, you're known
for really high concept,
Leigh Bowery style.
-Yeah.
-How does that translate
to a little person?
-Well, I ask her, like,
what are some of
your style inspirations?
And she said Jessica Rabbit
and...
both: Betty Boop.
-Cartoon makeup is
what I love doing,
so it's a match
made in heaven.
-Because of your
knowledge of design,
there are high expectations.
Does that make you nervous?
-It doesn't make me nervous,
'cause I feel like the first
challenge, I won,
and then I was in the bottom
right after that
and I've been safe since,
so I want to knock
this one out of the park.
-Good, good.
I'm looking forward to this.
-All right.
I'll not let you down.
-All right, kids.
Hey, guys.
-Hi, Ru. How are you?
-Hi, Brittney.
-Hi!
-Now, Brittney, have you
ever been made over before?
-No, I have never, but I was
on tour with Miley Cyrus--
-Miley Cyrus?
-Yeah!
She thought of the outfits,
and she made everything.
<i>So we had cones</i>
<i>coming from our boobs,</i>
all crazy stuff.
-Wow.
Thorgy, do you have any sketches
or anything?
-Actually, I just--that was
the stage we just got to.
-Okay.
All right.
Time is running out.
-I'm feeling the pressure.
-All right, Thorgy.
-Thanks a lot, Ru.
-Thanks, Brittney.
-Thank you.
-Cool.
-Hello!
both: Hi.
-So what do you have planned?
-Well, we are the Tin Woman,
and the Tin "Whoa, Man!"
-[laughs]
-So I was thinking
of creating
elements that can
go onto a body suit
or something like that.
-That's great, but haven't
you done that before?
<i>Wearing a body suit</i>
<i>or a bathing suit,</i>
and then putting something
on top of it?
We're looking for couture,
something inspired
by the Tin Woodsman,
so take it from there.
-I don't handle
losing very well,
so I will give this 120.
-Well, you say that while
you have a hatchet in your hand.
That kind of scares me.
[laughter]
All right, well, I'm gonna
let you get to it.
-[sighs]
Now I have to rethink ideas.
That really scares me.
Oh, God.
-All right, ladies,
gather round.
Gather round, ladies.
Now tomorrow, in addition
to your runway presentation,
I want each duo to perform
a dreamy interpretive dance
set in a poppy field.
Of course.
[laughs]
Ladies, good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
-This challenge
just went from my dream
to my biggest nightmare.
[pretends to cry]
-This week's maxi-challenge
is makeovers
<i>for the cast of</i>
<i>"Little Women: LA."</i>
-They're looking like they're
getting creative over there.
-Which one?
Oh, the Tin Man?
-Mm-hmm.
-I wouldn't be too worried
about Derrick.
-All right, let's do it.
-Okay.
-We're sleeping.
-Are we gonna lay down?
-Yeah.
-This whole time?
-Yeah.
It's finally time to rehearse
our interpretive dance routine.
To ask the question "Do I
understand interpretive dance?"
is to ask "Do I know
the entire pi formula?"
And the answer is "No."
-I woke up with a nightmare.
His face looks like
he's going for a dental checkup.
-Oh, my God.
Terra, you belong here with us.
-[laughs]
-Pow!
-Girl, what the hell
are you doing?
Like, she's just slapping
her little lady around.
-Fucking bitch!
-You gonna get a charge, girl.
You beating up on a little lady.
-Oh!
-I'm guessing we should
just play up the fact
that we're scarecrows.
-Okay.
-And maybe we can, like,
do like a cross, like--
-Should I go in front of you?
-Sure.
-And then it looks like
you put that leg out.
-I don't know what to do.
What's interpretive dance?
-Uh...
-Uh oh.
The Scarecrow people.
-Are they practicing?
What they doing?
-No, they both staring
at each other,
trying to figure it out.
[laughter]
-He ain't no choreographer.
He don't dance.
He was in the bottom last week.
-Uh oh.
-This is his time
to, like, step it up.
-I have no idea what the fuck
we're supposed to do.
-"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
-"What do you think?"
[both laugh]
-Y'all better stop
thinking and start doing.
[laughs]
-I love you.

Why is this machine
being a dick?
[machine stalling]
Oh, my God.
Do you want to see
something completely insane?
-[gasps]
What the fuck?
Why did you sew
it like this?
I don't even know
how you did this.
-No, I don't either.
Isn't that bizarre?
Apparently this fabric
cannot be sewn on.
So we've gone from a
beautiful, regal cape,
to making bustles to give us
sort of a regal flair.
I want to scream.
My brain just exploded.
-[screams]
Oh, shit!
[laughter]
-Yes, indeed.

-Oh, Lord. Bob, how much do
you have to do still?
-Way too much.
-I thought you were
almost done yesterday.
-I was.
My outfit fell apart.
-He had to remake
a new outfit.
-[Bob] So I get to
the workroom this morning,
<i>and try on my couture look,</i>
and the zipper
just like flies off.
<i>It falls apart, basically.</i>
Like, it is just non-functional.
<i>So I need to make</i>
<i>a new outfit.</i>
And on top of that,
I still have to do my makeup,
<i>I have to do Elena's makeup.</i>
I'm like F-M-L.
Oh, my God.
This is madness.
-So do you kind of
find it hard
being a, you know,
a little person?
-It was hard.
-I am made fun of
all the time.
-I get personally offended
by the word "midget."
Because "midget" doesn't
necessarily mean,
like, a person.
-Mm-hmm.
-It just means something small.
It's such a derogatory,
ugly word.
It, like, makes me cringe
when I hear it.
-Do you think it's
because people are just
afraid of what
they don't know?
-Yeah.
-You know what trips me out?
Is if I'm literally
at the mall walking,
and somebody's like, "Oh,
my gosh! Look at that midget!"
I'm like, "Are you serious?"
-People have
a long way to come.
-Yeah.
-I think that's why I feel so
comfortable around gay people,
'cause they get how I feel
because, you know,
they get treated
the same way.
-Right, exactly.
You can't stop being the height
that you are, you know?
-Yeah.
-It's like who you are.
-And you love
who you love.
-Right.
At the end of the day,
everybody just
wants to be loved.
Everybody just wants to fit in.
-Exactly.
-My confidence
didn't really build
until I had a child.
-So you could be strong
for your baby.
-Yes, and I had to
help her deal with it.
-Mm-hmm.
-I had to be an example.
She's average height,
and so
I was really hard on her, 'cause
I had to gain that respect.
-Yeah.
-At an early age,
because I knew by the time
she was seven or eight,
she was gonna be
taller than me.
And I refused to be
on somebody's talk show
saying "My kid
is whooping my ass."
-Yeah. [laughs]
-That was not gonna happen.

-[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Chi Chi
and Ti Ti DeVayne.
-[Marc Jacobs] I thought your
performance was really sweet.
<i>And the two of you</i>
<i>look really pretty.</i>
But I would like to
see it all pushed further.
-I have something to ask you.
I know you're not
a breast drag queen.
Do you ever
consider contouring?
-Yes, I tried to kind of
contour tonight.
-With what,
translucent powder, girl?
[laughter]
Because your waist
is not cinched.
We gotta balance out the man.
-[RuPaul] Next up,
Bob The Drag Queen--
not to be confused
with Bob The Court Reporter--
and Rob The Faux Queen.
-Elena, do you feel gorgeous?
-Yeah. I feel like
I'm in "Hunger Games."
[laughter]
-Totally.
Well, I thought
you really shone tonight,
and, Bob, I don't think
that's good for you.
Elena looks inspired
by the Good Witch,
and yours, I feel like I could
get that in a mall.
-I guess I thought
that was the challenge.
I was really wanting
to make sure that Elena
felt like a beautiful goddess,
you know what I mean?
-But you're the one competing.
-Okay.
-Next up, Naomi Smalls
and Jazzy Jems.
-Everyone should take a look
at Naomi right now.
This is how you win
this competition.
-Yeah, you did
an amazing job.
I mean, it just gave me
Scarecrow
in the most gorgeous way.
The look, the details,
the makeup.
I just thought
it was perfection.
-And you could not have asked
for a better partner--Jasmine,
with these straw leg warmers on.
[laughter]
It was just phenomenal.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Derrick
and Terra Barry.
-It just looks so homemade,
in the worst way.
-Uh, I'm not a seamstress,
but I did sew everything
on here.
-It's a piece of fabric.
We're, like, pretty far in
to the competition now.
You have to give us more.
That is not
a Britney reference.
-I have watched you in Vegas.
I know what
you're capable of,
and it just sort of saddens me
because you're better than
what you just did up there.
-Next up, Robbie
and Hedda Turner.
-I literally don't even know
what to make
out of what you're wearing.
Bustles can be flattering
when they're on a big gown.
This looks like just a bunch
of ruched up fabric stuck--
And we have to work
on that hairline.
-I guess I'm a little
more old school.
I come from big ol'
Christian hair women.
-Even Jan Crouch
found a way to blend.
-[laughs]
-Robbie!
We're at this point now.
It's, like, so frustrating,
because you are so talented
and all we want is
for you to bring it.
And we're missing it.
-All right, Kim Chi
and Miso Chi.
-I got a Kimbra, Feller,
"Voluptuous Horror of
Karen Black" sort of vibe,
and the look was fantastic.
<i>-I loved the beginning</i>
<i>runway walk,</i>
even though it was
a little wobbly.
You had a complete concept.
Great job tonight.
-Next up, Thorgy Thor
and Thorgeous.
-What I was
charmed by, really,
was when you eased on down
the road into your dance moves.
-Your look tonight,
I thought it was cohesive,
but it didn't wow me.
I'm not gonna remember in a
few weeks, driving in traffic,
thinking "Oh, God,
remember that look?"
You know?
-Ladies,
one final question:
who deserves to click their
heels and go back to Kansas?
Starting with Chi Chi DeVayne.
-[blows out air]
I'm sorry, Derrick, but
your outfit to me, was just...
a train wreck.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Based off this challenge,
I would pick Derrick as well.
-Naomi.
-Based on execution, I would
probably say Derrick's too.
-Derrick.
-Well, I would say
all three that said me,
but I know I have
to pick one.
I would say Chi Chi's.
It's hot-glued together.
It's cut fabric
with no detail.
-What say you,
Robbie Turner?
-Chi Chi's didn't
scream "Dorothy" to me.
-Kim Chi?
-I love her,
but I'm going to say Chi Chi,
only because
yesterday, when everyone
was just working hard,
she was just sitting there,
and that was a time
that she could have
spent on her outfit.
Sorry.
-Thorgy Thor, you're up.
-Kim Chi, you literally said
every word that I was gonna say.
I think in this competition
you have to apply
every single second
and I'm here to win,
so people like
Chi Chi piss me off.
-Yes, I did have extra time,
because I did hot glue
my outfit,
but I did what was
in my range of doing.
But that's how they feel, so
I respect y'all's opinion.
-All right, I think we've
heard enough, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Just between us
friends of Dorothy,
what do you think?
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
-I really didn't care about
the hot glue gun conspiracy,
issue, whatever.
[laughter]
Like--
-Gluegate!
-You know, there's a lot of
hot glue gunning going on,
even at the Met Ball.
-Really?
-I don't want
to name names, but--
-Please name names!
-Please do!
-Who's mad at a hot glue gun?
<i>BenDeLaCreme won</i>
<i>a fashion challenge</i>
<i>with a hot glued dress.</i>
-But here's the deal:
that outfit, at this point,
is nowhere near good enough.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Well, Bob The Drag Queen
made the biggest mistake
<i>you can make in show business:</i>
<i>you don't let someone</i>
<i>outshine you!</i>
-But Elena looked beautiful,
so he did his job there.
-I know that that was part
of the challenge,
but I wasn't looking at
Bob The Drag Queen tonight.
I was looking at Elena.
<i>-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.</i>
-Told her last week
I was getting bored
of seeing her in underwear,
so when she came out tonight
the way she did with something
creative, it was amazing.
-The look, from head to toe,
was flawless.
<i>The choreography was amazing.</i>
-I could not have
been more proud,
and I don't even know her.
[laughter]
<i>-Derrick Barry.</i>
-I'm banging my head against
the wall with Derrick
because you're just giving
me a bathing suit
<i>with something wrapped</i>
<i>around your waist, again.</i>
And putting two horse penises
on your shoulders...
-Oh!
-[laughs]
-Doesn't change it.
-I cannot.
-She's amazing as Britney.
And we still haven't
gotten past this, episode six!
-I know that
Britney's frustrated.
-She seems lost to me.
-You said "Britney."
Did you say "Britney"?
-I sure did, yeah.
-That's hilarious.
-But that's the point.
<i>-Robbie Turn-ter.</i>
<i>-Yes, we've seen</i>
way better looks before.
even this hair thing done better
by Kim Chi in episode one,
but I just can't make myself
hate it.
I would be so angry to see
Robbie go home.
-But how many times
is he gonna be excused?
She is holding herself back.
You saw it in
the acting challenge
and you're seeing it again.
-Kim Chi.
-I loved the look,
but the performance
was a little out there.
Didn't understand
the laying of the brooms...
[laughter]
<i>The collecting of the brooms.</i>
But, you know--
-The trading of the brooms.
-The trading of the brooms.
Returning of the brooms.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.
-Believe it or not, kids,
this is scaled back
for Thorgy.
<i>She edited, 'cause</i>
<i>she was much plainer.</i>
-I wasn't getting
drag queen glamour.
<i>And the wigs I thought</i>
<i>were a St. Patrick's Day</i>
markdown sort of situation.
-I didn't hate the Grinch pubes
wig that she came out with.
[laughter]
I liked it.
-She wasn't the best of the
night, and she wasn't the worst.
I--
-Silence!
I have made my decision.
Bring back my girls...
and Toto too!
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>
You're safe.
-Thank you.
[applause]
-Oh!
-Kim Chi.
<i>Your witch couture</i>
<i>slayed the house down.</i>
You're safe.
-Thank you.
-Naomi Smalls.
This week, you spun straw
into gold.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[cheers and applause]
You and Jasmine have each won
$1,000 worth of spa services
from The Spa on Rodeo.
-Thank you.
-Awesome.
-[Naomi Smalls] It feels amazing
that the legendary RuPaul
is saying my name
in a positive way.
<i>I am freaking out.</i>
-Bob The Drag Queen.
Your Glinda was not bewitching.
You are safe.
-Yeah!
-Thank you.
Thank you.
[exhales]
-Derrick Barry.
<i>Your tin couture</i>
<i>was rusted.</i>
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
Robbie Turner.
This week you are
not queen of the forest.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
your Disco Dorothy
did not inspire oohs or ahhs.
Robbie Turner.
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
-I'm pissed off.
Like, this is so unfair.
-Chi Chi.
You are safe.
You may join the other girls.
-Thank y'all so much.
-Yes!
-I guess I was hoping
for a miracle.
<i>Like they were gonna</i>
<i>pluck Chi Chi</i>
<i>and put her back in the bottom</i>
<i>two where she belongs.</i>
Fuck.
-Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip-synch
for your life.
[voice echoes]
<i>-This is it--I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to take Robbie down.</i>
I love her,
but I will send her home.
-Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.

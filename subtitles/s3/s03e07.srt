<i>Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:03,834
Snatch game!

3
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:06,900
- Yay!
- Okay.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,967
- Hi, how are you?

5
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,100
- Ooh, ooh!

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,033
- Naomi Campbell is
a cum-guzzling whore!

7
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:13,433
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.

8
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,633
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:15,967
- Stacy.

10
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:17,200
- Condragulations.

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,033
You are the winner
of this challenge.

12
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:23,500
- To see Stacy win,
and I'm in the bottom two?

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,567
W.T.F.?

14
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:27,300
- Delta Work.

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,400
Shantay, you stay.

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,233
This is the emancipation
of Mariah.

17
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,033
Now sashay away.

18
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:38,934
<i>And tonight...</i>

19
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:42,033
It's time to bare your souls.

20
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,734
<i>The queens have their cake...</i>

21
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,400
- Aw, thanks.

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,033
-<i> And eat it too.</i>

23
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,100
- I took a bite of it
and I swallowed.

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,233
- Oh, dear.

25
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,100

And may the best woman win!

34
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,867
- Morning.

35
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:40,433
- We're walking
into the workroom today.

36
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,066
And the whole entire room
is empty.

37
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,600
And at this point,
we're eight left,

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,834
and I need to step up my game.

39
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,066
- There's a message.

40
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,834
Aww.

41
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,233
- Cheers to Mariah.
- Mariah!

42
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,533
- Mug for days.
- Mug for days.

43
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,266
- I'm gonna erase it.

44
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,066
- The more people leave,
the happier I'll be.

45
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,100
It's just less noise in my ear.

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,567
I'm just an old granny,

47
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:05,300
and I just can't handle all
the yip-yap, chitter-chatter.

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,433
- So are you excited you won?

49
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:08,567
- I am.

50
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,200
Pulled that shit out
at the last minute, girl.

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,467
- I actually, like,
wasn't expecting it.

52
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:18,300
I don't know if Stacy's amazing
job last week was a fluke.

53
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,600
She's like the underdog that

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,700
people aren't paying
attention to.

55
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,967
- I'm proud of myself because,

56
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,333
you know, I had doubted myself
a few days ago.

57
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,867
There's people
in this competition

58
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,700
who feel like I'm not talented.

59
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,867
But I feel confident now.

60
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,600
So, you know, fuck these
other bitches, honey.

61
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,500
I feel like I'm gonna win
this shit.

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,800
- Heather.

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,433
- Heather wants to talk to us.
- Come hither, Heather.

64
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,166
- Heather, what are you making?

65
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,233
- I'm making my skirt, Heather.

66
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:41,900
Carmen, Manila, Delta and myself

67
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,433
have decided to call each
other "Heather."

68
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,567
Because we formed this clique

69
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,767
which looks a lot
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>

70
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,967
- We're basically
the pretty girls,

71
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,066
the top four.

72
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,533
And then there's
the other girls.

73
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,066
- Ooh, she left--
what did she leave?

74
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,433
Earrings, these are cute.

75
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,734
- We take a lot of pride
in what we do.

76
00:02:57,734 --> 00:03:00,233
And, um, I think that's where
we find a common ground.

77
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,433
So, so be it.

78
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,667
We're Heathers.

79
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,200
[laughter]

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,467
[siren wails]

81
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,233
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>

82
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,567
<i>You've got shemail.</i>

83
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,934
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

84
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,433
all: Hey.

85
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,967
-<i> I've got a little secret</i>
<i>I want to share with you.</i>

86
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,567
<i>I like cake.</i>

87
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,300
- Ooh!
- Oh!

88
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,500
-<i> Big, German chocolate cake.</i>

89
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
- Ooh.

90
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,767
-<i> If I could, I'd have a hot</i>
<i>cake in my mouth</i>

91
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>first thing every morning.</i>

92
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,533
- Me too.

93
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,600
-<i> If you love cock the way</i>
<i>I do, just be careful.</i>

94
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,900
<i>Don't bite off more</i>
<i>than you can chew.</i>

95
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,934
all: Oh, my God.

96
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,066
- I don't want
to eat anything crazy.

97
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,166
- It's cake.

98
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,200
- Oh, it's not cock?

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,233
- [laughing]

100
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,467
- Hello, hello, hello.

101
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,734
all: Hi!

102
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,100
- My girls.

103
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,867
Now, a drag superstar needs
to be able to serve womana,

104
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,233
even when she's stripped of her

105
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,834
wigs and padding and things
of that nature.

106
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,066
Now, I posed undraped
for a photograph in my book,

107
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,333
<i>Working It.</i>

108
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,300
And I did it without
compromising my Christianity.

109
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,066
I found the experience
so liberating,

110
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,500
I wanted to share it with you.

111
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,567
- Thank you.

112
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,300
- Now, for today's
mini-challenge,

113
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,667
you'll be posing for a tasteful,
intimate, feminine portrait.

114
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,533
And you'll be doing it
in the nude.

115
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,633
- Oh!

116
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,066
- Ooh!

117
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,300
- My heart just drops.

118
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,867
You know, I don't even like
to have sex naked.

119
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,300
- Now, in a moment you'll meet

120
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,734
celebrity photographer
Deborah Anderson,

121
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:35,433
who's renowned for
her artful nude portraits.

122
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,567
You have ten minutes to prepare.

123
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,200
You may use light makeup,

124
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,700
then it's time
to bare your souls.

125
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
Bye.

126
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,567
Let the games begin.

127
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,967
- Are you fucking serious?

128
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,166
My fat ass has got to take off
these clothes?

129
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,300
Y'all bitches is crazy.

130
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,433
- Oh, Jesus, take the wheel.

131
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,467
I just really don't want
to do this.

132
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,066
I have been single for a reason,

133
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,867
and now America is going
to find out why.

134
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:04,834
- Where is my bathrobe?

135
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,300
Oh, shit.

136
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,633
-<i> Hi, Stacy.</i>

137
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,967
<i>This is Deborah.</i>

138
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,233
- I have a piece of fabric
that you can use a little.

139
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,467
There's no pressure;

140
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,333
you do whatever feels
most comfortable to you.

141
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,500
- Let's get naked.

142
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
-<i> Serving womana.</i>

143
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,600
- All of a sudden I had

144
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,567
this spiritual awakening
that happened to me.

145
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,567
And I fell into it.

146
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,233
- Ooh, fabulous, fabulous.

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,834
Let's discuss the socks.

148
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,233
- Oh, right.
Gotta have these off.

149
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,333
- [laughing]
There you go, perfect.

150
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,533
Beautiful.

151
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,500
- You cannot knock the modeling
powers of Raja.

152
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Put me in front of a camera,

153
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,467
and I will pose you down.

154
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,467
- Beautiful, right there.

155
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,600
There you go, there you go.
Beautiful.

156
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Careful now,
not too much backside.

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,734
-<i> Too much ass.</i>

158
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,767
- I can't see anything.
- Yeah.

159
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,633
I wonder if you straighten
that top leg.

160
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:56,967
- There you go, there you go.
There.

161
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,633
- Yes.
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,200
A work of art.

163
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
- Bring that leg up, bring
that--beautiful, right there.

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,734
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

165
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:06,734
<i>Beautiful.</i>

166
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:07,734
<i>Fabulous.</i>

167
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,834
That body?

168
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,934
You kidding me?

169
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,100
Keep moving that face,
my darling.

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,233
It's like we've got
the same face in every frame.

171
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,834
I want choice, darling.
- Okay, I can do that.

172
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,133
- Otherwise, we're stuck
with one picture.

173
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,767
<i>Love.</i>

174
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,867
<i>Just watch where your light is.</i>

175
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,867
- You feel like you're
a little tentative here.

176
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,500
- It's horrible, the feeling
is just horrible.

177
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,066
I just want it to be over.

178
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,233
- Alexis, Alexis.
Look at me.

179
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,467
You're not there.

180
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,433
All I see is your nervousness.
Focus, focus.

181
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,567
Give me drama, okay?

182
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,367
We want the confidence,
we want the beauty.

183
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,533
And find that light.

184
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,734
-<i> Ooh, loving that.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>Loving, loving.</i>

185
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,300
Hi, Delta.

186
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,633
- Hi, how are you?

187
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,734
I'm so scared.

188
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,567
All I can think is
that this lady's

189
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,367
gonna freakin' laugh at me.

190
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,934
Deborah, nice to meet you.
- Oh, the joy.

191
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:54,934
I get a kiss, I love that.

192
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,100
- But I realize, this is it.

193
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,066
If I want to be the next drag
superstar, I have to do it

194
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,133
at all costs.

195
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,700
- If you indeed want to use it.

196
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,233
- I want to use every yard
of it.

197
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,367
[both laughing]

198
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,467
- Yeah, feel that light.

199
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:09,266
- There we go, there we go.
Beautiful.

200
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,166
Yes, loving that.
Loving that.

201
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,633
-<i> Gorgeous.</i>

202
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,900
<i>A new dawn for Delta.</i>

203
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,300
- And darling, we are done.

204
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,233
- Oh, cool.
- Awesome.

205
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,266
- [laughing]

206
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,734
- My biggest fear was met today.

207
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,133
I met it head-on.

208
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,133
I felt so liberated.

209
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,567
I would love to do it again.

210
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,834
- We won't be able to get you
to put clothes on anymore.

211
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,800
- No, I don't think so.
Carmen Carrera better watch out.

212
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,266
- [laughing]

213
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:38,233
Ladies, all I can say is
you give good flesh.

214
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,066
But one of your nude portraits

215
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,367
stood head and shoulders
above the rest.

216
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,367
Carmen Carrera.

217
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,367
-<i> Thank you.</i>

218
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,633
[applause]

219
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,700
Yay, I won.

220
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,934
Piece of cake.

221
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,500
- Now that we've all gagged on
Carmen's cheesecake photo,

222
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,600
I hope you've left room
for dessert.

223
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,066
For this week's main challenge,

224
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:10,066
each of you will be designing a
couture designer dress inspired

225
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:15,166
by one of these mouth-watering
cakes.

226
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,600
There's angel food,

227
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,567
red velvet, pineapple upside
down, chocolate lava,

228
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,066
cheesecake, princess cake,
carrot cake,

229
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,166
and my favorite,
strawberry shortcake.

230
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,834
[giggles]

231
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:27,867
Now, Carmen.

232
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,133
Because you won
the mini-challenge,

233
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,166
you will assign each queen
a cake.

234
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,066
I'm gonna start off
with this cheesecake.

235
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,166
- Aw.

236
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,667
- Thank you.

237
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,433
Carmen's gonna give me the one
with the boring colors.

238
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,734
I knew exactly
what she was doing.

239
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,300
- We'll go with
the pineapple upside down.

240
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,600
- One of my favorites.

241
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,633
- Mm...

242
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,133
We'll give it to Shangela.

243
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,467
- Aw, thanks.

244
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,667
Would you be happy with
a pineapple upside down cake?

245
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,200
- Who's got some shortcakes
here?

246
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,233
Yara.

247
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,066
- Whoo-hoo!
- Red velvet.

248
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,633
Mmm.

249
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,066
Stacy.
- My favorite.

250
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,734
- Angel food cake is next.

251
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,800
For the cool kids, I want to

252
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,367
make sure that they're taken
care of.

253
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,467
Delta Work.

254
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,467
- Aw.

255
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,333
- Carrot cake, Manila.

256
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,066
- Oh, yay!

257
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:20,266
- Chocolate lava,
that leaves one person.

258
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,066
- Thank you.

259
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:26,734
- And that leaves the princess
cake for the princess herself.

260
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,233
- Princess cake is the prettiest
one, so it's mine.

261
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,934
- Now to create
your perfect face, face,

262
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,934
face of cakes outfit,

263
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:38,567
you can use materials provided
by Michael Levine fabrics.

264
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,333
Your couture confection should
look good enough to eat.

265
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,567
Gentlemen, start your engines.

266
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,200
And may the best woman win.

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
See you later.

268
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,967
-<i> Whoo!</i>
<i>Got a cake, got a cake.</i>

269
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,300
<i>Got a cake, cake, cake.</i>

270
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,867
- I kind of need to be inspired
by my cake.

271
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,967
I need to taste it first.

272
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,333
Mm.

273
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,567
I'm getting an idea.

274
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,633
There's nothing I love more
than chocolate.

275
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,567
I could drip it
all over my naked,

276
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,333
lithe body over and over again

277
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,066
and just lick it off myself.

278
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,667
- Is anyone nervous?

279
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:08,934
Shangela?

280
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,500
- Evil bitch.
- Ha.

281
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,633
- The sewing challenges
in this competition

282
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,233
continue to be my downfall.

283
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,900
- When you put this together,
they create these barriers.

284
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
- Oh!

285
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,367
But what about the bottom?

286
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,834
- The fabric is not enough.

287
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,900
- Oh, no.

288
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,700
- No, this is the front.

289
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,900
This is just the front.

290
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
And where's the back?

291
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,333
You know what I mean?

292
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,800
- Right.

293
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,133
Now the question is, am I going
to fall in the hole,

294
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,233
or am I going to be able
to jump over that hole?

295
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,500
- So, Shangela,
what are you making?

296
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,834
- A dress.

297
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,166
Today's challenge is that we

298
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,467
have to create a high-fashion
couture outfit,

299
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:54,066
based on the type of cake
that we were assigned.

300
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:57,300
There are tons of girls left in
this competition that sew.

301
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,767
And here I am, still over there

302
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:02,433
trying to get the one-two
stitch down.

303
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,433
- Cuteness.

304
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,700
Heather, can you help me?

305
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,233
- Yes, Heather.

306
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,367
- I think it's hilarious we're
calling each other Heather now.

307
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,600
- Well, I mean, aren't we?

308
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,767
Those are our names.

309
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,433
- Like, didn't they all kill
each other?

310
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,433
- Well, yeah.
Only one Heather stands.

311
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,800
Right, Manila?

312
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,567
- Hello, my sweets.

313
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,433
all: Hi, Ru!

314
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,734
- Can I borrow a cup of sugar?

315
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,400
- Sure, darling.
- How you doing?

316
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,433
- I'm good, how are you?

317
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,767
- This cake is almost all gone.

318
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:30,767
- Well, not really.

319
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:31,967
It's just a few slices.

320
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,734
Part of the description
of this competition

321
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,200
was to do cake couture.

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,767
- You understand
what couture is?

324
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,433
- Yeah, pretty much.

325
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,200
- Pretty much.
- Yeah.

326
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,333
- One-of-a-kind,
special details.

327
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,867
- Honestly, I'm not a
high-fashion kind of drag queen.

328
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,433
So I think that's one of the
biggest obstacles I have

329
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,467
to overcome.

330
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,834
- All right,
I want to see fashion.

331
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,767
So I will see you
on the main stage.

332
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,333
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right.

333
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,333
Hey, Manila.

334
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,667
- Hi.

335
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,834
- So tell me about
your carrot cake couture dress.

336
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:05,967
- I'm kind of drawing from
Givenchy meets Jessica Rabbit

337
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,333
meets<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bunny.</i>

338
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,734
- Oh, that's a lot of ideas
going on there.

339
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,767
Are you sure you can incorporate
all of this?

340
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,100
- Well, I'm gonna try.
- Okay.

341
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,133
I can't wait to see it.

342
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,500
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

343
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,734
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.

344
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:21,233
- Now, of course this outfit
looks like cheesecake.

345
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,533
- I'm going for it.
- You're gonna go for it.

346
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,066
- That's the idea.

347
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:28,066
- Now, how are you gonna make
this more high-fashion couture?

348
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,567
- I will work with the style
of it.

349
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,066
It's not going to be
evening-gown Cinderella.

350
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,100
It's just gonna be
a high-fashion model.

351
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,166
- All right, kiddo.

352
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,734
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.

353
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,133
- Yes, thank you for visiting
me, Ru.

354
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,900
- All right, kiddo.

355
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,333
Yara Sofia.
- Yes.

356
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,600
- You're doing the strawberry
shortcake.

357
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,066
- Yes.

358
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,700
- Now, you sew for a living.
- I love to sew, I love it.

359
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,400
I'm gonna give the judges
a couture high-fashion dress,

360
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
but well-done.

361
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,567
I'm a strong, wicked bitch.

362
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,800
- All right, kiddo.

363
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,133
- Bye.
- Bye.

364
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,667
Raja.
- Hi, Ru.

365
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,900
- Chocolate lava cake.

366
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,967
- Hold me, Ru.

367
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,300
- [laughing]

368
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,867
- I took a bite of it,
and I swallowed.

369
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,367
- Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness.

370
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,900
- I swallowed it.
I'm a terrible model.

371
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,100
- But you had to bite it to get
your inspiration, right?

372
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,533
- Sure, sure.

373
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,467
- I've always been really
obsessed with different, like,

374
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:16,800
historical silhouettes.

375
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,867
So I just happened to have
these, like, French peignoirs,

376
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,133
and I was, like, maybe I can
kind of play with that with,

377
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,967
like, a little bit of an exotic,
Indian, spicy kind of thing.

378
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,200
- All right, get back to work.

379
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,667
- Okay, see you later.
- All right.

380
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,767
Delta Work.

381
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,834
- Hi, Ru.

382
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:31,834
- Angel food cake.

383
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:32,900
- Yes.
- Are you a fan?

384
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,934
- I am.

385
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,867
Of all the cakes
that you could go get,

386
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,066
it's the lowest in fat.

387
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,700
So I can eat the most of it.
- [laughing]

388
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,066
- I think I need to bring
something youthful.

389
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,200
- Yeah.

390
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,667
- And I think I need
to bring something fresh.

391
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,133
Because the characters that I've
been doing have always been

392
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,166
older than who I am.

393
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,633
- Right.

394
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,367
I think it's about making
something that's contemporary.

395
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,500
I know that that's what
the judges are looking for.

396
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,834
- I like that.
- Yeah.

397
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,967
I look forward to seeing
some fresh cake on the runway.

398
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,867
- I'm excited.
- All right, go for it.

399
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,900
- Thank you.
- Hey, Carmen.

400
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,934
- Hey, hey.

401
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,633
- Why did you choose
a princess cake?

402
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,367
- 'Cause I was just drawn
to the color.

403
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,100
- This is, like,
green and pink and white.

404
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,800
- But you're going
with just the pink here.

405
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,867
It's the Barbie interpretation
of a princess, isn't it?

406
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,166
- When I hear Barbie from Ru,
I'm like, "This is wrong."

407
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,567
I'm not trying
to be princess Barbie.

408
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,800
- Well, listen, I'm gonna let

409
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,700
you get back to creating
your Jersey couture.

410
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,767
- My Jersey couture, yes.

411
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:23,834
- Good luck.

412
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,867
- Thanks.
- All right.

413
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,066
Hey, Miss Shangela.

414
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,066
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?

415
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,367
- [deep breath]
I'm okay.

416
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,233
- On season two,
you had problems sewing.

417
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,533
- Yes.

418
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,867
- And it's what ultimately
got you eliminated.

419
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,500
How's it going this time?

420
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,533
- I don't know.

421
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,633
You know--

422
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,700
- You're nervous.
- I am.

423
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,266
- Has anyone offered to help you
out at all?

424
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,200
No?

425
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,467
Do you feel like the other girls
are not supporting you?

426
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,066
- I know this is a competition,

427
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,433
and everyone's out
for themselves.

428
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:57,633
- But you have helped
other girls.

429
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,967
Do you expect them to help you?

430
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,567
- I would--I would like that.

431
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,600
- Well, I think it starts
with you asking.

432
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,066
- What?
Seriously?

433
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:08,600
Like, Ru has been asking,
"Has anyone helped you today?"

434
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,133
And, bitch, she's made
the other girls her puppets.

435
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,467
- It's sometimes hard for me
to ask for help.

436
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,166
- Well--
- But I will, I will.

437
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,266
- Get in there
and make this happen.

438
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:21,400
Okay?
- Okay.

439
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,734
- All right.
Gather around, ladies.

440
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:26,633
Every time I watch one of those
cake decorating shows,

441
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:27,800
I say to myself,

442
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,567
"My queens could do a better job
in their sleep."

443
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:37,600
So in addition to finishing
your cake couture dresses,

444
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,967
you need to turn a real cake

445
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:43,800
into the ultimate edible
accessory.

446
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,066
- We have no time to make
these fucking dresses,

447
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,300
and now we gotta make a cake.

448
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,567
I don't want to see no more
motherfucking cake!

449
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,066
- Starting with a naked cake
and a look-alike doll,

450
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,100
the icing on the cake will be

451
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,767
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.

452
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:03,734
The end result should look
a little something like this.

453
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:08,600
You'll be debuting your
cake-stravaganza ensemble

454
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,300
tomorrow on the main stage.

455
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,066
And our guest judges will be two
sweet and stylish actresses.

456
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,367
The ever popular Sara Rue.

457
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,266
- Oh, my gosh!
- Ooh!

458
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,934
- And Eliza Dushku.

459
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,867
all: Ooh!

460
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,867
- Ladies, good luck.

461
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,567
And don't fuck it up.

462
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,066
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,600
all: Bye, Ru.

464
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,734
- Oh!

465
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,166
- I need to figure out
how the frick

466
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,734
I'm gonna decorate a cake.

467
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,066
- Now I got a cake to do too?

468
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,433
- I feel sick.

469
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:45,333
- This is gonna be a challenge
that we're gonna remember.

470
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,533
We have to not only create an
outfit for the runway look,

471
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:54,433
we have to create a cake that
represents who we are.

472
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,834
I don't even cook nothing
at home.

473
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:02,500
- Here we have our guest chef
from North Carolina.

474
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
What are you doing, girl?

475
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,633
- Uh, first I'm gonna ice
this motherfucker.

476
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,233
- Oh, really?

477
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,233
Ooh.

478
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,433
- You got to whip it good.

479
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,734
- Whippin' it, whippin' it,
whippin' it.

480
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,233
- No, no, whippin' is like this.

481
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,400
- No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

482
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm the chef.

483
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,834
- [laughing]
- Ew, that's not me.

484
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,066
That's some booger.

485
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,600
Who the fuck is that?

486
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,066
Yara's is beautiful.

487
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,700
- Yes, Yara, yours is hot.

488
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,400
Bitch, they retouched hers.

489
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,667
- Word of advice, do not leave
your cakes out in the rain.

490
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,066
- [laughing]

491
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,800
- Look at my Native American
[indistinct].

492
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,433
- What tribe are you from?
I don't really know.

493
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,467
- Lumbee Indian.

494
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,934
This is the traditional pinecone
circle.

495
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,500
- What's on the arm?

496
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,233
- Fancied-out shawl.

497
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,900
Being the only Native American
in this competition,

498
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,133
I thought it would be different,
you know,

499
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:53,066
not just to decorate the cake
in my own style,

500
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:58,066
but, you know,
to represent my heritage.

501
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:01,300
- I offered Shangela to help her
with her garment,

502
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,633
because, for me,
it's nice to see

503
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,867
that somebody actually takes
advice and trusts you.

504
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,166
Because in a competition
like this one,

505
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,367
it does tell me a lot
about Shangela.

506
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,233
It amazes me how you trust me.

507
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,600
- Yeah.

508
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,834
- When you know I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

509
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,066
- Oh, that's great.

510
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,133
That makes me feel real good
right about now.

511
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,900
Oh, I go on the outside
of your stitch?

512
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,100
- Even if you're going on top
of it, it doesn't matter.

513
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,200
You're just going to reinforce.

514
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
- It's okay,
I'm just reinforcing it.

515
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,500
Okay, cool.
Ooh.

516
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
Oh, crazy.

517
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,100
Oh, come on.

518
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,800
Work with mama, work with mama.

519
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,100
- Shangela gets the most
of her help from Alexis.

520
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,467
She gets makeup help,
now she's getting sewing help.

521
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,834
And if Alexis would have left
last challenge,

522
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,166
then maybe Shangela would have
just been sitting there,

523
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,433
confused.

524
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,467
- This machine,
this bitch's name is Bertha.

525
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:03,467
Work, Bertha!

526
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,500
Oh, fuck.

527
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,166
- Ugh, annoying.

528
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,967
- Now you know.

529
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:10,967
- Hey, Raja.

530
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,066
What does your family think

531
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,166
about you getting in drag
and stuff?

532
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,300
- Oh, they like it.

533
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,700
They know that I enjoy doing it.
So...

534
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,767
- That's all that matters, huh?

535
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,266
- Yeah, that's it.
What about you?

536
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,633
- My mom was, like,
really cool about it.

537
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,300
- And what about your dad,
where's he at?

538
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,834
- My father passed away
when I was two, in the '80s.

539
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:26,967
- Oh, babe.

540
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,400
- I met his family, like,
a year ago.

541
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,900
- Really?
- I didn't know them.

542
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,367
I didn't have any type
of relationship with them.

543
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,834
But, yeah,
it's just really weird.

544
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,567
Like, I'm trying to, like, find
out little by little as much

545
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:36,767
as I can about him.

546
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,700
Growing up, I had my mom,
I had my grandmother.

547
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,166
And it was enough for me.

548
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,867
But I always wondered, how would
my personality have changed,

549
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,367
having my father in my life?

550
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,734
But I'm very happy
for who I am now.

551
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,467
- What was the reaction,like,
when you met your dad's family?

552
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,567
- I wasn't going to keep it from
them that I was gay.

553
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,500
They kind of gagged
a little bit.

554
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,667
So after that shocker,
I was like,

555
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,100
"Oh, and I do drag
on top of that."

556
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,200
- Oh, awesome.

557
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,734
- And then they gagged again.

558
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,000
And after that,
everything's cool.

559
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,100
- Manila,<i> ven aqui.</i>

560
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,734
- Yes, mama.
How can I help you?

561
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,500
- When you won your challenge,

562
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,600
did you feel a little bit of
extra pressure after winning?

563
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,233
- Oh, for sure.

564
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,400
No, they're looking at you
even harder.

565
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,700
- Judging, and--

566
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,166
- 'Cause you were, like, you
were the best of the best.

567
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,734
And, like,
once you're at the top...

568
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:23,734
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,300
- The only way to go is down.

570
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,367
So, like, you have to prove it
to everyone.

571
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,500
And be, like, I'm gonna be
on the top again.

572
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,266
- I'm just trying to figure out
couture,

573
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,567
'cause I don't wear couture.

574
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:33,800
I don't know.

575
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,633
I felt very confident
at the beginning.

576
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,633
You know, Ru comes over.

577
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:41,367
And I went from maybe
a nine to, like, a three

578
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,834
in, like, ten minutes.

579
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,367
So I don't know
what to do anymore.

580
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,900
I mean, what do I do?

581
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,033
- What is this?

582
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,333
They're, like, strawberries?

583
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,767
- No, I don't know what the fuck
that was, girl.

584
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,734
I just designed it.

585
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,000
It doesn't even look couture.

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,033
- Huh?

587
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,100
- How would it look in here?

588
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,300
- Uh, like a football player.

589
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,266
- I don't know;
it was just an idea.

590
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,900
- I mean, I like
the asymmetrical look of it.

591
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,533
Yeah, do, like, one side.

592
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,500
Make it asymmetrical.

593
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,967
That's always more couture.

594
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,533
But I ain't gonna tell you how
to design your damn thing.

595
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,700
- [laughing]

596
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,233
- 'Cause, honey,
I'm gonna win this one.

597
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,900
Check.
- Okay.

598
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,300
[alarm clock ringing]

599
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:25,133
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh la la!

600
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,233
- Look at the mess.
- Look at this mess.

601
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,533
- Cake time.

602
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,200
- We're back in the workroom
this morning.

603
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,700
We have to decorate the cake.

604
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,066
And we have to finish our
costumes for today's runway.

605
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,600
- So this morning, I'm looking
at my sequined dress.

606
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,867
And I'm, like,

607
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,500
"Listen, these judges are gonna
read me down."

608
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,767
This dress isn't my style
of cake.

609
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,633
- Hey, Carmen.
- What are you doing?

610
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:46,934
What do you think
about the dress?

611
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:47,834
Tell me.

612
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,233
- About my dress?
- Yes.

613
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,867
- I found some really nice green
fabric today, thank God.

614
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,133
And I just whipped something up
real quick.

615
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,166
- Oh, so you sew.

616
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,600
- Well, I guess I do now.
- Yeah!

617
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,734
[laughing]

618
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:03,667
- Let me do your braid.

619
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,567
Oh, here you have...

620
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,133
It's pretty?
- Yeah, it's pretty.

621
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:10,066
Maybe, can we start it higher?

622
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,133
- Yes, it could be.

623
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:15,767
- Yara was helping Shangela
style her wig.

624
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,066
Yet again, help.
She needs a lot of help.

625
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,233
- She's like fucking doing
her hair.

626
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,233
- I know.

627
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,266
- It just really upsets me.

628
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,066
I'm representing myself here,

629
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,900
not the work of other people.

630
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,233
- Bless her helpless
little heart.

631
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,066
- For today's main challenge,

632
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,700
we actually have to design
a high-fashion cake look.

633
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,834
And we actually have
to decorate a cake.

634
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:44,700
- Oh, I've always wanted to put
safety pins on a child's cake.

635
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,133
- Oh, well.
Hallelu.

636
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,767
Can I make a suggestion,
just an artistic one?

637
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,934
- Yeah, most definitely.
- Just bring the corn up higher.

638
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:53,867
Right now it looks like corn
straight out of the can.

639
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,533
- Is that a read?

640
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,400
I didn't say anything about
that graffiti mess

641
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,100
that she had going on
on her cake.

642
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,166
- Ooh, work.

643
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,533
- But I decided
to take her advice

644
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,800
and add a couple more kernels.

645
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,834
Hallelu.

646
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,367
- What a beautiful corn
you've made.

647
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,066
- Yeah.
- Shangela.

648
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,667
- I need iridescent.

649
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,700
- Yara, do you think it's cute?

650
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,200
It looks like a cheesecake.

651
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,633
- Ooh, Alexis' costume.
She might be in trouble.

652
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,333
I mean, there's nothing more
unflattering

653
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,767
than to, you know, strap
a blanket around your waist.

654
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,066
- I'm freaking out.

655
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,533
I still have a lot
of finishing touches

656
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,467
on my runway look.

657
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,066
I really don't know how
I'm gonna finish this cake

658
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,367
and finish my outfit

659
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,266
before the runway time.

660
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,734
- Raja.
- What--

661
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh!

662
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
- Is there any way to get
a little bit more height here?

663
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,500
- Let me see, Stacy.

664
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,100
- Not with these.

665
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,633
- [laughing]
I was about to say.

666
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:00,600
- It looks like comfy couture.

667
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,867
Stacy's couture,
runway worthy outfit,

668
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,867
inspired by tights.

669
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,533
Hmm... bold move.

670
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,667
- I have the colors,
I have the white shoes.

671
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,100
I have capris.

672
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,567
I feel like it's couture.

673
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,800
[laughter]

674
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,300
- Hello!

675
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,633
- Hey!

676
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:40,567
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

677
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,166
Michelle Visage.

678
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,266
- RuPaul!

679
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,867
- Billy B.

680
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,333
Why, you old geezer.

681
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,500
- I'm hungry.

682
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,800
- Sara Rue.

683
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,433
- Hello.

684
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,100
- Love the name.
- Ooh, yeah.

685
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,433
I love yours.

686
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,233
- Eliza Dushku.

687
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:57,133
- That's right.

688
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,467
- Welcome to my dollhouse.

689
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,800
- I'm Susie stalker fan
right now.

690
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,734
I love you, Ru.
- Security.

691
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,734
- [laughing]

692
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,867
- This week,
we challenged our queens

693
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:09,533
to create cake-inspired
couture dresses

694
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,533
and then to decorate a doll cake

695
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:14,967
that expresses
their true drag persona.

696
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,934
Gentlemen, start your engines.

697
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,767
And may the best woman win.

698
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:27,066
Yara Sofia, serving
strawberry shortcake.

699
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,166
- Look at those stems.

700
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,066
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.

701
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:33,266
-<i> I'm bringing a Puerto Rican</i>
<i>strawberry shortcake.</i>

702
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,200
- Now, I see her berries.

703
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,367
But where's her twig?

704
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,266
- It's hiding in the vine.

705
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:40,800
- Serving carrot cake, Manila.

706
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,700
Ooh, as a blonde.

707
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
- What up, doc?

708
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,133
- Where's she hiding
that carrot?

709
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:48,400
-<i> I have my Madonna Louis</i>
<i>Vuitton rabbit ears.</i>

710
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,233
<i>I got my cute little</i>
<i>Samantha Jones belt on.</i>

711
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,467
<i>And I'm just going to pump down</i>
<i>that runway</i>

712
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,800
<i>like a starving model.</i>

713
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,100
- Trix are not for kids
with this one.

714
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,533
- Mm.
- That's right.

715
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,333
Alexis Mateo,

716
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,633
serving cheesecake.

717
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,533
- She's a high-end cheesecake.

718
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:08,400
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling high-fashion.</i>

719
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,867
<i>I just want to serve drama</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

720
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,266
- Designer cheesecake.

721
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:13,934
- A little bit
Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.

722
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:15,400
- [laughing]
- That's there, too.

723
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,600
Princess cake,
from Carmen Carrera.

724
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,500
- Of course.
- Of course.

725
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
-<i> I'm serving something</i>
<i>really different:</i>

726
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,934
<i>a different hairstyle.</i>

727
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,433
<i>I have the shaved side thing,</i>

728
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,767
<i>that, like, Cassie, and other</i>
<i>celebrities are doing.</i>

729
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,900
- Paris Hilton.
- Paris Hilton, that's right.

730
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,934
- Heatherette.

731
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,333
- Yes.
- Yes.

732
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,200
- Oh, here's one hot piece
of cake.

733
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
- Mm-hmm.
- Red velvet cake.

734
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,333
From Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw.

735
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,834
-<i> I have my puffiness going on.</i>

736
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,967
<i>I have my white</i>
<i>and my red velvet.</i>

737
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,300
<i>I know I look delicious, honey.</i>

738
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,834
- This would make me get
off my diet.

739
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:48,600
- Shangela,
pineapple upside down cake.

740
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,467
- It's like Barbra Streisand
meets pineapple cake

741
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,066
with a touch of Rapunzel.

742
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:56,066
-<i> I'm serving "pineapple upside</i>
<i>down keep turnin' me" cake.</i>

743
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:57,667
<i>I'm serving cake</i>
<i>on my shoulder,</i>

744
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:00,300
<i>and I'm definitely serving</i>
<i>cakes in the rear.</i>

745
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,734
- She's all pretty
with a cherry on top.

746
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,700
- Always gotta have the cherry.
It's the first thing to go.

747
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,734
- Yes, it is.

748
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,767
Delta Work,
angel food cake!

749
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,433
- [gasps] Look, it's the teen
angel food cake.

750
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:10,967
- It is teen angel.

751
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,500
-<i> I hit the stage today, and</i>
<i>I think it's undeniable that</i>

752
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,066
<i>I'm doing angel food cake.</i>

753
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,100
<i>I feel confident.</i>

754
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,834
<i>I know that there's no way</i>
<i>that I can land in the bottom.</i>

755
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,934
- Heaven must be missing
an angel food cake.

756
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,800
- Uh-huh.
Peggy Lee stole it.

757
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,667
- That is Raja,
serving chocolate lava cake.

758
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,967
-<i> I step out onto the runway,</i>

759
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,333
<i>and I am completely aware that</i>

760
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,433
<i>there's a possibility</i>
<i>of my undergarment showing.</i>

761
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,700
<i>But the rest of it</i>
<i>is pretty awesome.</i>

762
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,266
<i>And so what if a little bit</i>
<i>is showing underneath.</i>

763
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:42,734
- It's bubbling lava, honey.

764
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,500
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.

765
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
- And a glass of milk.

766
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,567
- Ooh!

767
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,934
- Welcome, ladies.

768
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,533
It's time
for the judges' critique.

769
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,533
Yara Sofia.

770
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,066
Tell us about your doll cake.

771
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,467
- This is mini-me.

772
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:03,066
She's wearing a national costume
with the Puerto Rican flag.

773
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,600
-<i> Echa pa'lante!</i>

774
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,567
- Yes!

775
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,333
- Now let's hear
from our judges.

776
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,567
- Did you have a run-in with
the police this morning?

777
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,066
Because someone beat the hell
out of your face.

778
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,734
- Thank you, thank you.

779
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,567
- I love the dress.

780
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:18,200
I knew instantly you were
strawberry shortcake.

781
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
- When you're wearing white,

782
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,133
wearing a darker undergarment
might not be the best.

783
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,133
Just 'cause it pulled me out
of the fantasy.

784
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,734
- Sara, a little inside
information.

785
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:30,500
There's a lot more than
a dark underwear going on

786
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,633
underneath there.

787
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,066
- [laughing]

788
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:39,967
- Let's move on to Stacy Layne
Bryant Matthews Lattisaw Q.

789
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,734
- As everybody knows,
I'm Native American.

790
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,400
I actually decorated

791
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,800
in a traditional regalia
for a female.

792
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,467
- You definitely pulled off
the red velvet.

793
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,467
And it made me hungry.

794
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:50,633
- Would you like to taste?

795
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,333
- You and I have this thing.
You know I do.

796
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,734
- [laughing]

797
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,066
- It's too simple.

798
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,066
- All of the interest
is up here.

799
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,734
It sort of looks like you had
a skid and have a strawberry

800
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,300
and then some glitter got in it.

801
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,500
- The outfit's not couture
in my eyes.

802
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,133
- All right.

803
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,767
Up next, it's Manila.

804
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,300
- This is little baby Manila,

805
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,166
and she took a little trip down
to Chinatown,

806
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:16,467
and she got a whole buttload
of fake designer purses

807
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:18,233
shoved up underneath this dress.

808
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,367
- When you first came out,
the belt, I loved it.

809
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,200
And then I hated it.
And then I loved it.

810
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,300
- Yeah, and you know.

811
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,367
Loving something and hating
something

812
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,400
at the same time
is very couture.

813
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,633
I mean, you've got
a lot going on.

814
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,100
- Yeah.
- Right, right.

815
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,333
- Your makeup here looks like
that you had an accident with

816
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:35,166
the flour when you
were making the cake.

817
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,500
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.

818
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Now tell me
about your doll cake.

819
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,633
- It screams Latina.

820
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:43,500
It screams passionate.

821
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,400
This doll is actually who I am.

822
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,967
Just in a cake.

823
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,867
- One thing that I think
about the skirt.

824
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,333
It's not particularly
flattering.

825
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,567
You have to admit.

826
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,333
I mean, there are bedspreads
made out of that.

827
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,600
- We girls are trying
to maintain a figure.

828
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,900
And, to me, that adds
unnecessary bulk.

829
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,200
- What is the material that you
used to wrap around your hair?

830
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,667
- It's just fabric.

831
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,300
- I feel like if you're gonna do
that,

832
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,100
like, really show that fabric
and make it precise,

833
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,333
so that it's really sleek.

834
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,834
- Is it plain?

835
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:15,867
Yes, but maybe that's how you
wanted to represent yourself.

836
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,266
- Up next, Raja.

837
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:21,800
- I wanted it to feel really
edgy and very straight

838
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
and punk and fun.

839
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,166
Sort of like me.

840
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,667
- You reminded me how much
I love chocolate.

841
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,100
For sure.

842
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,533
- Your makeup went a little bit
more spooky

843
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,967
than I think you meant for it.

844
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,867
It's too Goth, I think.

845
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,266
- I wanted to yell out when you
were walking, like,

846
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,967
"Oh, no, honey!
We see your white bloomers."

847
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,033
- I know.
- Now, Sara.

848
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,133
- Yes, Ru.

849
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,600
- Would you put that cake
in your mouth?

850
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,633
- No, I would rub it
all over my body.

851
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,233
- [laughing]

852
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,800
- I think that cake's amazing.

853
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
- All right.

854
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,200
Carmen Carrera.

855
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,467
- Thinking about my cake,

856
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,800
I just wanted to put a lot
of that, like, queen,

857
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,700
like, pageant girl,
that I have in me.

858
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,934
I just wanted it to be pretty
and sparkly.

859
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,967
- And you're very diamond
princess, like Trina.

860
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:04,166
And how'd you go from turning
your dress from pink to green?

861
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,400
- When me and you had spoke,

862
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,066
the minute you mentioned Barbie,

863
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:10,767
I was like, "I don't want to be
Barbie princess on the runway."

864
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:14,867
- The dress and the belt, and
I think your hair and all of

865
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:18,300
that--I'm not sure how it
becomes a princess,

866
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,934
except maybe the princess
of New Jersey.

867
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,100
- Being a Jersey girl,

868
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,533
I'm very proud to say
that you look

869
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,433
like the princess of New Jersey.

870
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,800
But here's the thing.

871
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,233
You're way sexier
than that doll.

872
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,700
You should have done her sexier.

873
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,100
- Can we just talk
about from the neck up?

874
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,066
This sort of, like, mohawk off
to the side

875
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:35,967
with those jewels,

876
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,800
it's gorgeous.

877
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,333
- Next up, Delta Work.

878
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,066
- I really like
what I'm wearing.

879
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,200
I thought I would sort of do
an inspiration of that

880
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
in, like, a little ball gown.

881
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,066
So I made sure that I had,
like, pearls.

882
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:49,433
And then there's rosettes on
here that mimic the rosettes

883
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,367
that are at the bottom--

884
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,900
- Oh, yes.
- Trim of, um, here.

885
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,900
- Delta, I loved
your look tonight.

886
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,800
I think it's glorious.

887
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,767
- Thank you so much.
- And your cake is on fire.

888
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,533
- It reminds me of that scene
in<i> Grease,</i>

889
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,700
where she's a beauty-school
dropout.

890
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,200
- Oh, yes!
- Frenchie.

891
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,934
- It just, like--yeah!
I just think it's great.

892
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:10,700
It made me happy
when you walked out.

893
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,967
I was, like, "Oh!"

894
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,934
- Up next, Shangela.

895
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,667
- The doll cake
is very Shangela.

896
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,333
Of course, corn has always
haunted me and I've embraced it.

897
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,266
As you can see,
the Shangela has a hand up.

898
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:23,300
She's saying hallelu.

899
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,567
- The dress, it's cute.

900
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,166
It didn't totally blow me away.

901
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,433
But I mean,
it makes sense for your cake.

902
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:32,433
- With the makeup, something
is freaking me out today.

903
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,533
You're much friendlier
and prettier of a person

904
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,800
than the way you're painted.

905
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,233
- All right, this is my question
for you, Shangela.

906
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:39,400
- Yes.

907
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,100
- All these queens
that I see in front of me,

908
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,066
I can tell that being a queen
is their life.

909
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,567
I question that about you.

910
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,967
Is being a drag queen
what you really want to do?

911
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,600
- Yes.

912
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,266
You know, some people have 20
years doing drag,

913
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,066
and I only have
a little over one.

914
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,233
- Understood.

915
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,867
- But I'm here
because I want to be here.

916
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:01,066
And I'm here because I want
to be the Next Drag Superstar.

917
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,100
100%.

918
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,667
- Okay.
- Shangela, one last question.

919
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:04,834
- Yes.

920
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,166
- Who do you think should go
home tonight?

921
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,867
- Carmen Carrera.

922
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:12,300
- Clearly I have to disagree
with Shangela.

923
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,467
I mean, I think that my outfit

924
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,900
is a little bit more
high-fashion than hers.

925
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,567
- I'll present the
same question to Stacy.

926
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,567
- Carmen.

927
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,800
There's high-fashion looks here,

928
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,066
but just don't feel
like she executed that.

929
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,066
- Same question.

930
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,066
Delta Work.
- Stacy.

931
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,734
You know, I think maybe Stacy
thinks, like,

932
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:31,400
sometimes, "Well, I'm big, so
there should be

933
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,834
some accommodation made."

934
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:35,500
And I don't allow
any accommodation for myself.

935
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,133
- Manila, I want a serious
answer from you.

936
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,467
- I would like to see
Shangela go.

937
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,233
She's just a loudmouth,

938
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:43,667
and she's always talking
and hallelu-ing.

939
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,800
- Raja.

940
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,633
- Stacy and Shangela,
get the fuck out.

941
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,934
- Tell me why.

942
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,133
- Oh, Stacy.

943
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,333
I--you know, I'm not sure
if she's ready.

944
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,667
And Shangela, although
your personality shines,

945
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,200
I think you should be
on season five or six.

946
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
That's where you should be.

947
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,066
- That's interesting, Ru,

948
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,133
because Raja's been in the game
for 20-plus years doing drag,

949
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,367
and I've been only for one.

950
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:05,200
And we're in the same
competition here.

951
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,166
- Well, girls.

952
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,633
I think we've heard enough.

953
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:12,333
While you go and untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,

954
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,633
the judges and I
will deliberate.

955
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,600
You may leave the stage.

956
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,767
Just between us girls.

957
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,066
Let's start with Yara Sofia.

958
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,200
The dress.
Would you wear that dress?

959
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,433
- No.

960
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,934
- She was supposed to recreate
a couture creation

961
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,066
of her cake that she was given,

962
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,467
which is a strawberry shortcake.

963
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,066
And I thought
that was interpreted

964
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,533
and executed flawlessly.

965
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,734
- She keeps building
in this competition

966
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,934
in ways that we really
didn't anticipate.

967
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,266
- She's the dark horse.

968
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,266
- The pro is her personality.

969
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,900
- Her cake was hysterical.

970
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,333
- It was.

971
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,367
Here, I'm gonna take a little
taste of her cake right now.

972
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,400
- Mm.
- Good?

973
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,500
- It's moist.

974
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,433
Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw Q.

975
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,934
- I am a sucker
for people's backstory.

976
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,600
And I think the fact
that she's from Swampville.

977
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,066
- Back Swamp, yeah.

978
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,300
- I don't want to fall in love
with somebody's backstory.

979
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,500
I want to fall in love with
what's on the stage.

980
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,066
- The reality of it tonight
is that she looked awful.

981
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,266
- Manila.

982
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:08,767
Now, Manila's dress
I thought was fantastic.

983
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:11,500
I wasn't crazy
about all the accessories.

984
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,567
- It was just kind of strange
and cartoony in a way.

985
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:18,533
- I was so obsessed with
that gray, cadaver makeup.

986
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,567
- I loved Manila.

987
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,834
I would have worn that dress.

988
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:22,333
Again, yes, I would have taken
off the carrot belt.

989
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,300
- Yeah.

990
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,500
- But, you know,
we all would've.

991
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,934
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.

992
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,300
I understand the silhouette.
I know what she was going for.

993
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,066
But the execution of it
wasn't fierce.

994
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:35,333
- The skirt looked like
the polyester bedspreads.

995
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,500
- Motel 6.

996
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,467
If you put a black light on it,
you'd run.

997
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,867
- Let's talk about Raja.

998
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:44,533
I was surprised about the
pantaloon storyline, you know.

999
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,333
- It happens.
I've been on red carpets.

1000
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,533
And sometimes, you know,
you just--it happens.

1001
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:52,166
I just think she is not to be
played with, and I like her.

1002
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,900
- Now, Sara, do you think
that her Depends...

1003
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,066
- Yeah?

1004
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,133
- Cost her the top spot?

1005
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,233
- It didn't bother me,
'cause it was such a--

1006
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:01,433
it was so clearly, like,

1007
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,133
"Whoops," you know,
she made a mistake.

1008
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:06,367
- The reason why I said that the
makeup went a little bit spooky

1009
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,767
is because I couldn't find
anything wrong with her.

1010
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,467
Her cake was a piece of art.

1011
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,367
- Carmen Carrera.

1012
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,200
- Like, if we could pick
"from the neck up winner,"

1013
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,567
she would be my winner.

1014
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:17,900
- When somebody gets their
16-year-old a car at Christmas,

1015
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,433
that's the bow that goes
on the top.

1016
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,834
- Her face looked pretty.
Her hair looked pretty.

1017
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,700
I loved the little tiara
that was on her head.

1018
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,567
But was it lower-level
than the other ones?

1019
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:25,567
Yes.

1020
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:26,934
- Delta Work.

1021
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,400
- She looked amazing
when she rounded the corner.

1022
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,767
And then, as she stood there,

1023
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:34,333
I saw more and more wrong
with the outfit.

1024
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,200
- I thought, quite honestly,
she looked gorgeous tonight.

1025
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
- Miss Shangela.

1026
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,767
- If you still don't know how
to beat your face,

1027
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:45,233
which is a huge part
of being a drag superstar,

1028
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,467
then you're not ready.

1029
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,500
- The other ones live
to be drag queens.

1030
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,700
She stands out as one who does
not live to be a drag queen.

1031
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,066
- It seemed to me tonight,

1032
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,367
that there was, like, a lot
of raw talent there.

1033
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,100
She just didn't quite know
what to do

1034
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,834
'cause she doesn't quite have
the training.

1035
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,500
- Well, then,
she shouldn't be here.

1036
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
- Right.
- Silence!

1037
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,867
I've made my decision.

1038
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:07,467
Bring back my girls.

1039
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,333
Welcome back, ladies.

1040
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,800
Based on your face of cakes
presentation on the main stage,

1041
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,066
I've made some decisions.

1042
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,967
Yara Sofia.

1043
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:24,166
Your strawberry shortcake
was sweet as pie.

1044
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,367
<i>Echa pa'lante.</i>

1045
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,133
You're safe.
- Thank you.

1046
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:28,367
- Delta Work.

1047
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:33,367
Your angel cake couture had
one too many layers.

1048
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:37,800
But the overall effect
was heavenly.

1049
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,667
You're safe.
- Thank you.

1050
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,333
- Stacy Layne Matthews.

1051
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,300
Your red velvet cake
was hard to swallow

1052
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
and not couture.

1053
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,633
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1054
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,767
- It just pisses me off
that a lot of these bitches

1055
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,100
look like shit.

1056
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,400
But, you know, I wanted to do
something different.

1057
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Everybody's wearing
fucking dresses.

1058
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,767
I should have made a dress
and called it a day

1059
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,533
and been the fiercest bitch
onstage.

1060
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:07,266
- Manila.
You doll cake was moist.

1061
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:10,934
And I want another piece.
You're safe.

1062
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,900
- Thank you.

1063
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,867
- Raja.

1064
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:17,700
Even though you flashed
your knickers,

1065
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,400
the judges couldn't stop
gushing over

1066
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,533
your chocolate lava couture.

1067
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,600
Condragulations.

1068
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,734
You're the winner
of this challenge.

1069
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:29,367
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree

1070
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,900
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.

1071
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,233
- Thank you so much.

1072
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:36,467
This is my second time winning
a challenge.

1073
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,300
And I think I deserved it.

1074
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,767
Because I have a master's degree
in fierce.

1075
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:46,367
I should be a professor.

1076
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,433
- Carmen Carrera.

1077
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:53,233
Your Jersey princess cake
couture did not hit the spot.

1078
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:55,333
Alexis Mateo.

1079
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,533
You're a sweet talker,
but your cheesecake couture

1080
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:01,233
struck a sour note
with the judges.

1081
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,834
Shangela.

1082
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:10,400
You and a sewing machine
are a recipe for disaster.

1083
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,500
Shangela, you're safe.

1084
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,333
Is there anything you'd like
to say?

1085
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,300
- I'm here
because I want to be here.

1086
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,133
And I appreciate
what you see in me.

1087
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,500
And I'm gonna continue
to show you

1088
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
that not only
am I an entertainer,

1089
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,800
but I am a drag queen.

1090
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,066
And I'm meant to be here.

1091
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:37,900
- Carmen Carrera.

1092
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,667
Bada-bing, you're safe.

1093
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,166
- Thank you, guys.

1094
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,066
- Alexis Mateo.

1095
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm sorry, my dear,

1096
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,467
but you are up for elimination.

1097
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,967
- I consider Stacy my friend
in this competition.

1098
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,400
But if you give me the choice
between me and her leaving,

1099
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,767
of course I'm gonna choose her.

1100
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:01,500
- Two queens stand before me.

1101
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,066
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1102
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:08,133
and save yourself
from elimination.

1103
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:16,066
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.

1104
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:21,834
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

Ladies.

1144

I've made my decision.

1145
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:58,100
Alexis Mateo.

1146

Shantay, you stay.

1147
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:10,533
Stacy Layne Matthews.

1148
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:13,100
You've come a long way
from Back Swamp.

1149
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,200
But from this moment on,
the world is watching.

1150
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,834
Be proud, be a star.

1151
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,633
But most of all, be a lady.

1152
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:24,600
Now sashay away.

1153
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,066
Thank you.

1155
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,800
- Love you.

1156
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,867
- Stacy.

1157
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:35,667
- I never thought that,

1158
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:36,867
coming from a small town
in North Carolina,

1159
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,266
that I would even be
in a place like this.

1160
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,467
So, you know, it's amazing.

1161
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:42,133
I'm just glad to have made it
this far.

1162
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,166
I'm very proud of myself.

1163
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,333
I'm happy with what I've done

1164
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,734
and what I brought
to the competition.

1165
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,233
Condragulations, ladies.

1166
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:52,066
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1167
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,900
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1168
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,533
Can I get an amen up in here?

1169
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,533
all: Amen!

1170
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,867
- All right.

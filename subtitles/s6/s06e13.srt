346
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:31,233
THEN NO ONE
CAN FAULT YOU FOR THAT.

347
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,867
- I HAD TO CUT MILK
OUT OF MY DIET

348
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,133
AND I WASN'T READY.

349
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,700
I'M NOT READY FOR SOY.

350
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,900
IT DOESN'T TASTE THE SAME!

351
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,166
- CAN I GET MY PHONE BACK?

352
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
- NUMBER 4.

353
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,000
- EVERY TIME WE GO
ON "UNTUCKED,"

354
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,633
ONE MINUTE THEY READING HOES,

355
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,934
THE NEXT ONE, THEY BOO-HOOING
INTO THEIR GLASSES.

356
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,367
I CAN'T TAKE IT!

357
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,934
- YOU GOT EVERYTHING FROM MAMA.
WE'RE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

358
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,400
YOU GOT THE BOOBIES.

359
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,333
WELL, MAMA AIN'T GOT A BUTT,
BUT YOU DO.

360
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,967
- [LAUGHTER]

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,367
- AND GET GHETTO IF YOU HAVE TO
WITH THESE GIRLS, OKAY?

362
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,367
SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME
WITH THAT MONEY.

363
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,734
- MY MOM'S A CHOLA,
SHE LIKES BIG COCKS, OKAY!

364
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:08,734

365
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:09,734
NUMBER 3.

366
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,467
- I FEEL VERY ATTACKED.

367
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,166
- RELAX, RELAX.

368
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,834
- AFTER THE STAND-UP,
LAGANJA BROKE DOWN...AGAIN.

369
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,100
- I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE

370
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,800
TO BE A DRAG QUEEN,
WHEN I'M...

371
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,333
- BREATHE, BREATHE.

372
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,467
- IF YOU ARE GOING TO CRY
THAT FUCKING MUCH,

373
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,100
GET A BETTER DAMN LASH ADHESIVE

374
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,133
AND WATERPROOF
FUCKING MASCARA.

375
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:34,767
- THE 5 Gs: GOOD GOD,
GANJA, GET A GRIP.

376
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
- THIS IS JUST TOO FUCKING MUCH.

377
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,266
YOU BROKE ME DOWN,
I FEEL LIKE SHIT,

378
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,233
I LOOK STUPID.

379
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,633
GOD, THIS FUCKING SUCKS.

380
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:47,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK
ALL THE TIME TO EPISODE 8

381
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,266
FOR PEOPLE TO TELL LAGANJA
THAT HER VOICE WAS ANNOYING.

382
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,000
COME ON! OKAY?

383
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,633
- THAT'S NOT FAIR, I'M SORRY,

384
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,867
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VOICES,
YOU KNOW?

385
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,967
I'VE BEEN TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE
MY VOICE WAS ANNOYING,

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,500
AND, YOU KNOW, NOW,
IT'S HOW I MAKE MY MONEYS.

387
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,000
- WORK, BITCH.

388
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,367
- NUMBER 2.

389
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,200
- I AM HIV POSITIVE.

390
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,800
I WANTED TO COME ON THIS SHOW,

391
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,133
AND I WANTED TO BE
THAT VOICE FOR PEOPLE

392
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:17,200
WHO ARE SCARED
TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THAT.

393
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,700
- TRINITY ADMITTED
THAT SHE HAS HIV,

394
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,767
WHICH I THINK
IS EXTREMELY BRAVE.

395
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,133
- I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU.

396
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,500
YOU TOLD ME
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,

397
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,934

00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,500
SO HERE WE ARE.

399
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,734

THAT TRINITY K. BONET'S MOTHER

400
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,333
SENT THAT BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE

401
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,934
AND THE FACT
THAT SHE JUST SEEMED,

402
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,100
LIKE, SO TEAM TRINITY,
I LOVE THAT.

403
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,467
I THINK ALL MOTHERS
SHOULD BE THAT OPEN

404
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,433
AND LOVING TO THEIR KIDS.

405
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,967

- [LAUGHTER]

410
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,433
- AND SOME PEOPLE
SHED REAL TEARS.

411
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,367
- I BELIEVE
EVERY LIVING CREATURE

412
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,333
IN THE UNIVERSE
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO LOVE

413
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,033
AND TO BE HAPPY.

414
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:08,600

- RU'S OUTFITS ARE ANNOYING,

517
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,400
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL,

518
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,400
AND I HATE HER.

519
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,767
- YOU'RE SWEET. I LOVE YOU.

520
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,400
THE TOP 5 JUDGE MENTAL MOMENTS.

521
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,734
- THE JUDGES GOT INTO IT
THIS SEASON, HONEY.

522
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,500
THEY WERE TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.

523
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,600
- NUMBER 5.

524
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,500
- I CAN SEE ADAM LAMBERT
WATCHING THESE THIGHS.

525
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,233
HE WANTS SOME CHICKEN LEG. 
I KNOW IT.

526
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,300
- ADAM AND APRIL CARRION

527
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,400
SITTING IN A TREE,

528
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:41,200
DOING SOMETHING WE CAN'T SEE.

529
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,367
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

530
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,300
- YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.
- OH, THANK YOU.

531
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,567
- GET A ROOM.

532
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,934
- BUT YOU CAN HEAR IT, AND IT
PROBABLY SOUNDS LIKE THIS.

533
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:51,233
[SUCKING NOISE]

534
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,367
AHH...

535
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,133
- NUMBER 4, THE OG DREAM GIRL,
SHERYL LEE RALPH.

536
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,800
- LOVE THE ORIGINAL DREAM GIRL.

537
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,900
COME ON, IT DOESN'T
GET BETTER THAN THAT,

538
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,533
AND SHE DON'T MIND TELLING IT
LIKE IT IS, EITHER.

539
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,800
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BEARD
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

540
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,467
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT.

541
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,667
PUT A CORK IN IT.

542
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,633
- PUT A CORK IN IT. I WAS LIKE--

543
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,734
- LITERALLY, SPEAK
WITH THAT CORK IN THE MOUTH.

544
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:18,133
IT WILL DO WONDERS
FOR ENUNCIATION.

545
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,467
- IT HELPS YOU ENUNCIATE
YOUR WORDS,

546
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,533
AND PEOPLE
CAN UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER.

547
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,000
- NUMBER 3, LEAH REMINI IS HERE.

548
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,967
- SO THE LIPSTICK
SHOULD STAY ON.

549
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,667
- SHE SAID IT LASTS
THROUGH ALL THAT.

550
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
- I LOVE LEAH REMINI AS A JUDGE,

551
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:35,500
SHE AND MICHELLE ARE JUST
LIKE THOSE TWO MUPPETS

552
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:38,066
WHO JUST
READ THE SHOW FOR FILTH.

553
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,033
- WHEN LEAH REMINI
AND MICHELLE VISAGE

554
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,400
WERE GETTING INTO IT, HONEY,

555
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,567
I WAS LIKE, "CAN THIS BE
THE 'UNTUCKED' EPISODE, PLEASE?"

556
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,133
- DID IT STAY ON
THROUGH THE TRICK OR NOT?

557
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,266
- YES.

558
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,633
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THAT.

559
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,600
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

560
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,867
- YEAH, YOU WERE
ON THE KING OF QUEENS?

561
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,233
I'M THE QUEEN OF QUEENS.

562
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,200
- I THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING
TO BE TOO FUNNY,

563
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,066
THEY WERE TRYING
TO OUTDO EACH OTHER,

564
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,500
AND THAT'S NOT A TEAM PLAYER.

565
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,233
- I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
YEAH, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

566
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,400
- HALLELUJAH.
- SO THEY CREATED A CHARACTER--

567
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:05,567
- PAUSE. ONE SECOND, RU.
- OKAY.

568
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,567
- MICHELLE JUST
SAID I WAS RIGHT,

569
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,633
SO IF WE COULD
JUST TAKE A MOMENT.

570
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,533
- I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
- [LAUGHTER]

571
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,166
- SPEAKING OF SISTERHOODS,

572
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,266
YOU HAVE MICHELLE VISAGE
AND SANTINO RICE GOING AT IT

573
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,400
LIKE THEY'RE HAVING
THEIR OWN FREAKING QUARRELS.

574
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,066
I--DO THEY JUST NOT
AGREE ON ANYTHING?

575
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,200
- NUMBER 2.

576
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,767
- HE WANTS TO SAY
WHATEVER I SAY, THE OPPOSITE.

577
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,567
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

578
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,100
- I THINK
THAT MICHELLE AND SANTINO

579
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,533
ARE DEFINITELY FIGHTING
A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS YEAR,

580
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:34,533
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
A 33% INCREASE IN SIDE EYE.

581
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:37,767
- IT WAS GREAT TO SEE BIANCA
DEL NERO IN THAT LIGHT.

582
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,200
- OR DEL RIO.

583
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,900
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE
WATCHING BIANCA DEL NERO'S PAST.

584
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:44,400
- DEL RIO?
- WHAT'D I SAY?

585
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,433
- DEL NERO.
- NO, DEL RIO.

586
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,166
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE SAID--

587
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,700
DEL NERO.
- I WOULD NEVER SAY "DEL NERO."

588
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,133
- YOU SAID IT TWO TIMES.
GO TO THE TAPE.

589
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,734
- WE HEARD YOU SAY IT TWICE.
- SHUT THE FUCK--NO.

590
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,767
- YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY
IF YOU THINK YOU DIDN'T SAY IT.

591
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,734
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE WATCHING

592
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,934
A TAPE FROM BIANCA DEL NERO.

593
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:01,867
[LAUGHS]

594
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
NOW YOU'RE NODDING,
YOU JUST SAID.

595
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,500
- THIRD TIME.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

596
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,867
- WHAT'S A DEL NERO?

597
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,033
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.

598
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:12,767
NUMBER 1. "DRAG RACE"
SUPER FAN KHLOE KARDASHIAN.

599
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,467
- KHLOE KARDASHIAN
IS SORT OF LIKE

600
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,867
THE HONEY BADGER OF DRAG.

601
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,367
SHE DOESN'T CARE.

602
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
- BASIC BITCHES NOT WANTED.

603
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,700
I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.

604
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,300
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE.

605
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,700
I'M A BIG GIRL.

606
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:27,233
- I LOVE ANYBODY'S WHO'S GOT
A LARGE AND IN-CHARGE PUSS.

607
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,700
- HASHTAG NO FILTER.

608
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:32,400
- NOW, DURING KHLOE KARDASHIAN'S
SECOND APPEARANCE THIS SEASON,

609
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:37,100
SHE PERFORMED ON THE MAIN STAGE
WITH RAVEN AND MANILA.

610
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,066
THE SEQUENCE WAS SUPPOSED TO AIR

611
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,967
ON "KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS,"

612
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,467
SO THIS FOOTAGE IS SO EXCLUSIVE,

613
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,033
IT GOT CUT FROM NOT JUST ONE,
BUT TWO SHOWS.

614
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,700
LOOK AT THAT BODY,
MY GOD, IT'S GORGEOUS.

615
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,433
- WHICH ONE? ME? OH.

616
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,900
- YOUR PADS ARE AMAZING.
- [LAUGHS]

617
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,934
- YES.

618
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,100
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE LIP-SYNCHING

619
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,233
ON THE STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE" AGAIN.

620
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:04,000
- ♪ SASHAY SHANTE
PANTHER ON THE RUNWAY ♪

621
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:07,567

00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,000
- WHOO! THANK YOU, BOO.

625
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:20,533
- RAVEN AND I LOST
TO KHLOE KARDASHIAN.

626
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:21,567
DAMN.

627
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,900
- UP NEXT,
THE TOP 5 SMACKDOWNS.

628
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:27,000
- YES, GOD, NESSA.

629
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,667
- ONE FINAL LOOK
AT OUR TOP 3 QUEENS.

630
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,467
AND WHY ARE THESE QUEENS
BLINDFOLDED?

631
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,033
- BITCH, GET INTO IT.

632
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,600
- FIND OUT
AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:

633
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:40,000
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.

634
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:43,633
[LAUGHS]

635
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,900
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."

636
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,934
NOW, HERE
AT THE "DRAG RACE,"

637
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,433
WE'RE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

638
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,433
AND LIKE EVERY FAMILY,

639
00:24:56,467 --> 00:25:00,000
WELL, SOMETIMES
SHIT DO GET REAL.

640
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:02,467
THE TOP 5 SMACKDOWNS.

641
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,533
NUMBER 5.

642
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,033
- BITCH, ANYBODY THAT COMES
DOWN THE RUNWAY

643
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,400
LOOKING LIKE THAT,

644
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,033
THINKING THAT THE TONY AWARDS,

645
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,066
I WANT TO GET INTO YOUR BRAIN,

646
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,367
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

647
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,867
- GIA IS VERY ONE-SIDED
WITH HER IDEA OF DRAG.

648
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,300
I COULD GO OFF
ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS

649
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:20,200
THAT SHE NEEDS TO FIX,
BUT I'D RATHER NOT.

650
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:23,066
- GIA'S DRAG IS ALL
ABOUT BEING FISHY,

651
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,900
GIVING THE ILLUSION OF A WOMAN,

652
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:28,233
AND MILK'S DRAG
IS KIND OF OPPOSITE THAT.

653
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,300
- I LOVE MILK'S DRAG.

654
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,100
I THINK THERE'S
AN AUTHENTICITY TO IT.

655
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,900
IT'S JUST HIS OWN PARTICULAR
THING, AND I LIVE.

656
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,133
I COMPLETELY LIVE FOR MILK.

657
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,567
- JUST GOT OFF THE BOAT,
YOU KNOW,

658
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,033
A LITTLE TRIP FROM ASIA.

659
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,967
JUST LANDED LIKE FRESH TILAPIA.

660
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,033
- WHY'S SHE SO PROUD OF TILAPIA?
IT'S LIKE THE CHEAPEST FISH.

661
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,967
- SASHAY AWAY.

662
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,767
- YOU GUYS ARE ALL STILL DUDES.

663
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,100
- NUMBER 4.

664
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,867
- NICE TO MEET YOU, COURTNEY.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.

665
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,066
MY NAME'S JOSLYN FOX.

666
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,533
- WHEN WE NEED A LOW-RENT
VERSION OF COURTNEY ACT,

667
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,567
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

668
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
[LAUGHTER]

669
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,800
- SOMETIMES IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOUR IDOL,

670
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,900
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.

671
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,700
- YOUR DRAG ISN'T AS POLISHED
AS OTHER DRAG

672
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:06,300
IN THE COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.

673
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,100
I'M NOT BEING MEAN.
I'M JUST BEING FACTUAL,

674
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,633
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IN ANY WAY TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

675
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,467
- IT WAS VERY BIG SISTER,
LITTLE SISTER, YOU KNOW?

676
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,700
THE LITTLE SISTER
IDOLIZING THE BIG SISTER,

677
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:20,667
AND THEN SHE WAKES UP
AND REALIZES THAT IT'S A MAN.

678
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,600
[LAUGHS]

679
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,800
- I'VE GOT MY LACE FRONT
GLUED DOWN.

680
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,333
I DO GLANCE OVER
AND NOTICE JOSLYN

681
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:32,000
GIVING A LITTLE SIDEBURN ACTION.

682
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:35,667
WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER
INTO A NICE LACE FRONT WIG.

683
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,200
- NUMBER 3.
- YOU WON A CHALLENGE.

684
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,667
- I WON THE FIRST CHALLENGE TOO.

685
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,200
- OH YOU DID? OH.

686
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,333
- I DID.

687
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,800
- I WASN'T THERE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.

688
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,533
- HONEY,
I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON,

689
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,567
SO I DIDN'T SEE THE ULTIMATE
SHADE SHOWDOWN COMING.

690
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,367
- WHY DID DARIENNE HATE
BEN SO MUCH?

691
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,633
- DARIENNE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE ME?

692
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,433
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

693
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,934
- OOH!

694
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,600
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT INTIMIDATES A GIRL MORE,

695
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,266
THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD
AT THE THINGS

696
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,100
THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT,
OR THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD

697
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,400
AT THE THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT.

698
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,000
- I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY
TO BE A COUGAR.

699
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,200
- [LAUGHS]

700
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,734
- AND A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
COUGARS ARE DELUSIONAL.

701
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:15,066
- DARIENNE DOES NOT LIKE DELA,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

702
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,767
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

703
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,400
- I'M NOT A MONSTER.

704
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,500
- NUMBER 2.

705
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,166
- I DO FEEL A LITTLE BIT SHAFTED
BY YOU TODAY.

706
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,467
- WHEN?

707
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,166
- I DON'T REMEMBER
THE EXACT COMMENT YOU SAID.

708
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,467
- WHAT DID SHE SAY, LAGANJA?
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.

709
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,767
- I TRIED
TO FIGURE IT OUT, LIKE,

710
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
WHAT IT IS I THOUGHT YOU SAID,

711
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,633
AND I THINK IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,

712
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:38,967
I WAS JUST REALLY EMOTIONAL
AND DISTRAUGHT AND ALREADY DOWN.

713
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,433
- BUT I FELT LIKE AT ONE POINT,
MAYBE EARLIER,

714
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,800
OR MAYBE YESTERDAY,

715
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,100
THAT POSSIBLY THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON

716
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,300
BETWEEN ADORE AND LAGANJA,

717
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,200
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER,
BUT I'M SORRY.

718
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,333
- NUMBER 1.

719
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,834
- FUCK THESE BITCHES.

720
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,433
ARE YOU IN A WHITESNAKE VIDEO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?

721
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,400
- SHE MOUTHED OFF
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

722
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,033
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE.

723
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,533
- I WILL SHOW YOU VERSATILITY

724
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,400
WHEN SANTINO
WINS A SEWING COMPETITION

725
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,367
AND VISAGE
WEARS A FUCKING TURTLENECK.

726
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,433
- AND THEN I LOVE THE FACT
THAT SHE THROWS THE TRUTH

727
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,400
BACK IN THEIR FACE.

728
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:09,467
- I'M MORE OF A BEYONCE MYSELF.

729
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,867
- AT LEAST BEYONCE'S DRESSES
HIT THE FLOOR.

730
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,734
- NOW, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.

731
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:17,333
BIANCA'S NOT A BITCH,
SHE'S RIGHT.

732
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,633
- WE'RE DRAG QUEENS
IN A FUCKING COMPETITION.

733
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,800
THE ONLY THING WORSE
IS FUCKING PRISON.

734
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,333
- NOW, LIKE TRUE SISTERS,

735
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:30,133
MY GIRLS ARE ALWAYS THERE
TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP.

736
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:35,033
LET'S COUNT DOWN THIS SEASON'S
TOP 3 SUPPORT HO'S.

737
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,166
NUMBER 3.

738
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
- WHEN EVERYBODY WAS BAGGING
ON MILK FOR HER LOOK,

739
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,967
JOSLYN WAS THE ONLY ONE
TO STICK UP FOR HER.

740
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,934
- YOU'RE IGNORANT.
I'M SORRY, IT'S IGNORANCE.

741
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,433
- OH, IGNORANT NOW.
- YES.

742
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,266
- OKAY, WELL, IGNORANT
WOULD BE ME NOT WANTING

743
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,433
TO BETTER EDUCATE MYSELF.

744
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,633
- WELL, EDUCATE YOURSELF.

745
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,900
- AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HER
WHAT SHE THINKS.

746
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,533
- NO, YOU'RE READING HER.

747
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,934
- OF COURSE,
WHEN A PERSON'S IGNORANT,

748
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,400
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.

749
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,600
[LAUGHS]

750
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,033
SO SHE GOT ALL BENT
OUT OF SHAPE,

751
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,600
AND IT WAS THE TRUTH.

752
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,567
- I'M NOT EDUCATED?

753
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,100
YOU LOOK
LIKE A FUCKING RECYCLING BIN.

754
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,467
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

755
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,467
- NUMBER 2.

756
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,600
YOU ARE BENDELACREME,

757
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:12,967
AND THAT'S THE CHARACTER
THAT YOU HAVE BUILT,

758
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,300
AND DON'T YOU CHANGE IT
FOR NOBODY.

759
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,100
- WHEN HER SISTERS
WERE FEELING DOWN

760
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,166
AFTER A ROUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE,

761
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
IT WAS NICE TO SEE
THAT TRINITY WAS ABLE

762
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,133
TO GO AROUND AND GIVE THEM
A LITTLE PEP TALK, YOU KNOW?

763
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,266
- DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP
OR FEEL BAD

764
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,667
BECAUSE COURTNEY,
YOUR COMPETITOR,

765
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,200
TOLD YOU
THAT YOUR LOOK IS NOT POLISHED.

766
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,166
- SHE WAS GIVING THEM A PEP TALK
LIKE SHE WAS A COACH

767
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,567
IN THE SUPER BOWL OR SOMETHING.

768
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
- EXACTLY.

769
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,767
- DID BEYONCE PERFORM
AT THE SUPER BOWL?

770
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,367
SHE WASN'T THE COACH, RIGHT?
[LAUGHS]

771
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,934
- NUMBER 1.

772
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,166
- REMEMBER, TRINITY,
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

773
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,734
YOU GOT THIS, BITCH.

774
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,567
- BIANCA HAS A SOFT SIDE,
AND SHE HELPS THE GIRLS.

775
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
- I THINK THAT BIANCA IS
ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE PERSON.

776
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,300
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY
A VERY SENSITIVE PERSON,

777
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,600
I'M IMAGINING.

778
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,767
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,

779
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,333
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER

780
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,500
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.

781
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,500
- I'M DOWN.

782
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,800
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.

783
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,633
- SECRETLY, SHE ALLOWED ADORE
TO BORROW ONE OF HER CORSETS

784
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:10,066
IN FRONT OF 9 CAMERAS.

785
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,166
WAY TO PLAY THE GAME, BITCH.

786
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,600
- COMING UP, LEGENDARY QUEENS
GIVE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE TOP 3.

787
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,233
- FOR SUCH A VICIOUS BITCH,
SHE SHO IS PURTY.

788
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,867
- CALM DOWN, BEYONCE.

789
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,700
- AND THE PIT CREW
SISSY THAT WALK.

790
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,100
- AY, DIOS MIO.

791
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,300
- AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:

792
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,767
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.

793
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,934
- OKAY?

794
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:36,800
- [LAUGHS]

795
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:42,166
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."

796
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
WITH JUST ONE WEEK
UNTIL WE CROWN

797
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:49,000
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME.

798
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,367
- PREGNANT PAUSE,
PREGNANT PAUSE.

799
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,367
- THE TIME HAS COME
TO SCHOOL THE CHILDREN

800
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,300
ON THE ABCs.

801
00:30:56,333 --> 00:31:00,367
LEARN IT, AND LEARN IT WELL.

802
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,367
- FUCK YEAH, I'M THE FIRST ONE!

803
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,934
- A YOUNG QUEEN BURSTING
WITH RAW TALENT,

804
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:10,633
AND THE ABILITY TO CHARM
HER WAY OUT OF...ANYTHING?

805
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,600
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT,
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,

806
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,367
AND I WANTED TO SHOW MY BODY.

807
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,033
- [LAUGHTER]

808
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,266
- ADORE HAS BABY JESUS EYES.
SHE JUST...

809
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,800
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE HER.

810
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,066
- I LOVE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE,

811
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,266
"MY DRESS DOESN'T HIT THE FLOOR,
AND I LOOK FUCKING COOL."

812
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,667
- YOU KNOW,
I LOVE THAT SHE'S GOT

813
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,367
A LITTLE BIT
OF MESSINESS TO HER.

814
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,667
I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT
UNDER THE ACRYLIC FINGERNAILS

815
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,900
IS KIND OF HOT SOMETIMES.

816
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,266
- I'M FUCKING HOOD.
I'M FROM AZUSA.

817
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,000
I'LL STAB A BITCH.

818
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,400
[LAUGHS]

819
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:39,433
- SHE TAKES THE CRITIQUES,
SHE TRIES TO GROW FROM THEM,

820
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,800
BUT SHE'S STILL LOVING IT.

821
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,500
- SHE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH WITH RU
IN THE WALKTHROUGH.

822
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:47,100
- I CAME HERE TO BE TOP 3,
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.

823
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:51,333
- YOU CAN TASTE
THAT SHE REALLY WANTED IT.

824
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,367
- OOH, GIRL, BITCH BROUGHT IT
FOR THE VIDEO SHOOT.

825
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,600
- HER SISSY
WAS SISSYING MY WALK.

826
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,166
SHE WAS GIVING ME SISSY SPACEK.

827
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,900
- SHE'S EAGER, SHE'S READY,
AND SHE SINGS.

828
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:06,633
- OH, AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE.

829
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,233
- OH, SHIT, SHE'S GOING
TO TAKE MY GIGS. I HATE HER.

830
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,200
- PARTY.

831
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,367
- ADORE MAY HAVE STARTED
WITH A WHIMPER,

832
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,033
BUT SHE ENDED WITH A BIG BANG.

833
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:20,500
WILL THIS FALLEN IDOL CONTINUE
HER RISE TO THE TIPPITY TOP?

834
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,533
- NOT TODAY, SATAN. NOT TODAY.

835
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:26,200
- BIANCA DEL RIO WAS
THIS SEASON'S MOUTH THAT ROARED.

836
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,400
- THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES.

837
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:31,100
- SHE'S A KILLER COMEDIAN,
A SEASONED QUEEN,

838
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,033
AND A DAMN SEAMSTRESS.

839
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,133
LOVE THAT DRESS.
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.

840
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,467
- THAT DRESS IS GORGEOUS.

841
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,734
- YOU CAN BORROW THIS ONE TOO.
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU, GIRL.

842
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,433
- NOT ONLY CAN SHE CUT
A DRESS PATTERN,

843
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:44,800
BUT SHE CAN CUT YOU TO FILTH.

844
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,734
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT YOUR MAMA.

845
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,100
MY NAME IS BIANCA.

846
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,967
- NOTHING GETS PAST BIANCA,
AND I LOVE THAT.

847
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,233
- AND I GOT TO THINKING
THAT IT WAS A CROCK OF SHIT.

848
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:57,200
- SHE'S THE BITCH
THAT I AGREE WITH.

849
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,800
- SHE KEEPS IT SO REAL,

850
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,266
AND EVERYTHING
THAT COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH

851
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,433
IS JUST ALL BRILLIANCE
ALL THE TIME.

852
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:05,133
- SHE'S A MAN WITH ONE EYE.

853
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,367
- AT THE BEAT OF HER EYELASH,

854
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,100
SHE COULD DROP
A FREAKING ONE-LINER.

855
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,200
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?

856
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,433
- WELL,
THEY'RE ALL HELPING ME OUT

857
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,033
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.

858
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:13,367
- [LAUGHS]

859
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,734
- I WAS PRETTY FLABBERGASTED
HOW SWEET BIANCA HAS TURNED OUT.

860
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,700
SHE'S ACTUALLY HELPED PEOPLE
DO THEIR MAKE-UP,

861
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:19,900
CINCHED THEIR BODY,

862
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:22,233
AND REACHED OUT
IN A TIME OF NEED.

863
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,433
- IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
CALL A HATEFUL BITCH LIKE ME.

864
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:29,000
- BUT IS SHE REALLY HELPING?
YOU NEVER KNOW.

865
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,500
THIS IS A COMPETITION, GIRLS.

866
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:31,834
- COME ON, SHAKE IT OFF.
SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF.

867
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:33,467
PRETEND IT'S GAS.
JUST LEAVE IT IN THE HALLWAY.

868
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,567
- BIANCA DEL RIO

869
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,000
IS A TAKE-NO-PRISONERS
PROFESSIONAL BITCH

870
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,000
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.

871
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:42,100
- YOU ALWAYS END
WITH A NASTY COMMENT.

872
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,800
- I ALWAYS BEGIN WITH ONE TOO!

873
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,767
- SHE'S A CUTTHROAT CONTENDER
FOR THE CROWN,

874
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,567
BUT SHE'S NOT ALONE.

875
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,667
- IS THIS "AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL"?

876
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,567
- ENTER COURTNEY ACT.

877
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,734
- I HONESTLY WANT TO JUST SKIN
YOU ALIVE AND WEAR YOUR BODY.

878
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,967
- A PROVEN SINGER AND SUPERSTAR
FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER,

879
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,467
COURTNEY ACT CAUGHT
OUR ATTENTION FROM DAY ONE.

880
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,533
- [SQUAWKS]

881
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:05,667
- [LAUGHS]

882
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,633
- OH, IF PRETTY HURTS,
COURTNEY IS MURDERING US.

883
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,633
- EVERY TIME SHE WALKS DOWN
THE RUNWAY, I'M LIKE,

884
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,500
"WHO LET THAT GIRL IN HERE?
CAN SOMEONE CALL SECURITY?

885
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,800
"THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN
WALKING AROUND

886
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,066
THE MAIN STAGE."

887
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,967
- SUCH A SHAME ABOUT THAT BODY.

888
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,600
I KNOW SHE WISHES SHE HAD
MY CURVES AND SWERVES, BABY.

889
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,633
- THE ONLY THING WRONG
I WOULD SAY IS, YOU'RE PERFECT.

890
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,000
- WELL, EVERYONE ELSE
IS RELYING ON UGLY.

891
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,000
WHY CAN'T I RELY ON PRETTY?

892
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,166
- [LAUGHTER]

893
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,800
- SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.

894
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:39,633
- ♪ I DON'T DRINK
OR EAT OR CUSS ♪

895
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,967
- I HATE THAT.

896
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,200
- JUST WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO HATE COURTNEY,

897
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,200
SHE DOES SOMETHING NICE.

898
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,467
YOU SHADY LITTLE BITCH.

899
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,300
- YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF
A NICE MAN

900
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,734
LOOKING JUST LIKE THAT.

901
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,133
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

902
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,467
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRDLY PROPORTIONED BODY.

903
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,033
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DO,
AND SO WHAT?

904
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:58,800
- COURTNEY HAS STAR QUALITY
WRITTEN ALL OVER HER.

905
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,033
- WOULDN'T IT BE SO EXCITING

906
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:04,233
TO HAVE AN AUSTRALIAN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?

907
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,800
- WILL THIS AUSSIE IMPORT
PULL AHEAD

908
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:11,300
AND LEAVE THESE DOMESTIC MODELS
IN HER DUST?

909
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,333
- COURTNEY DEFINITELY
HAS WHAT IT TAKES

910
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,500
TO BE AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR, BUT I--

911
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:16,734
- BIANCA SHOULD WIN.

912
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:20,200
- I LIKE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S 22, AND SHE'S--

913
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:24,100
- SILENCE.
I HAVE NOT MADE MY DECISION.

914
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:27,700
SO WHOSE TEAM
ARE YOU PLAYING FOR?

915
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:31,233
TEAM ADORE DELANO,
TEAM BIANCA DEL RIO,

916
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:33,233
OR TEAM COURTNEY ACT?

917
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:37,333
HASHTAG IT AND TELL THE WORLD
WHO YOU THINK SHOULD BE CROWNED

918
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,834
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.

919
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,000
- COULD WE JUST
CROWN THIS BITCH ALREADY?

920
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:45,000
- UP NEXT,
MY GIRLS GO BLINDLY

921
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,033
WHERE NO QUEENS
HAVE GONE BEFORE.

922
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,233
- OKAY.

923
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:51,800
- PLUS, THE WORLD VIDEO PREMIERE
OF "SISSY THAT WALK"

924
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,333
WHEN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:

925
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:56,166

926
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,934
[LAUGHS]

927
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,133
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."

928
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:09,166
ADORE DELANO, BIANCA DEL RIO,
COURTNEY ACT,

929
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,433
WHO DO YOU THINK

930
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:14,300
HAS THE BIGGEST CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE, AND TALENT?

931
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,500
STARTING NOW,

932
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:19,567
YOU'VE GOT ONE WEEK
TO LET ME AND THE WORLD KNOW.

933
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,567
RIGHT, GIRLS?

934
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,567
- YES, GOD.

935
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,867
- ABSOLUTELY.

936
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,567
- DON'T WEAR BACON.

937
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,567
- THIS SEASON,
I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED

938
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,133
FOR PROMOTING
TOO MANY OF MY PRODUCTS,

939
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,767
SO, TONIGHT

GONNA DO IS CHOOSE MY LOOK.

SAID TO JOSLYN ABOUT HER

- ADORE DELANO, HOW
ARE YOU DOING?

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,500
- OK, I'M FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO

255
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,767
COME NATURAL.

256
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,400
WHEN I WRITE SHIT DOWN, IT
GETS LIKE,

"OH, GOD, I'M--"

THIS TIES INTO THE CRITIQUE

00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,367
YOU GOT LAST WEEK ON
THE JUDGE'S PANEL, WHICH IS THAT

260
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,367
IF YOU'RE PREPARED,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

261
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,800
- RIGHT.

262
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,333
- ADORE'S REALLY CONFIDENT
IN CERTAIN AREAS, BUT IF IT'S

263
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,633
OUTSIDE OF HER COMFORT ZONE,
SHE KIND OF CRUMBLES.

264
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,667
I DON'T THINK SHE
TRUSTS HERSELF ENOUGH.

265
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,166
- CAN I HEAR A LITTLE
BIT OF YOUR OPENING?

HOW MANY STRAPS ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR FOR THE INTERVIEW?

- ZERO.

278
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,567

279
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,266
BEFORE THIS, DID YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CHAZ

280
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,667
OR GEORGIA HOLT?

281
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,133
- I LOVE CHAZ WITH
HIS TRANSITION.

282
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:27,033
I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY
FORTHCOMING, AND GEORGIA I

283
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:30,433
BECAME FAMILIAR WITH AFTER
THE LIFETIME DOCUMENTARY.

284
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,600
YOU KNOW, SHE LOST THE ROLE
TO MARILYN MONROE

285
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
FOR "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE"?

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,633
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

287
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,166
LOVE HER.
- YES.

288
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,967
SO YOUR BIG OPENING--
HAVE YOU WORKED ON THAT?

289
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,367
- I HAVE. I HAVE.

290
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,767
PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE WHO
CAME OUT OF CHER'S VAGINA

291
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,266
AND THE VAGINA
CHER CAME OUT OF.

292
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:50,533
- I'M JUST A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE TALKING

293
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:54,700
ABOUT CHER'S VAGINA
COULD POSSIBLY OFFEND

294
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,266
MOTHER AND SON.

295
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,934
- BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE ENTERTAINMENT LIES.

296
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,900
- YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT QUEEN THAT PISSED OFF

297
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,700
CHER'S FAMILY.

298
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,033
HELLO?

299
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,967
- LISTEN, WE'RE DOWN TO JUST
VERY FEW GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW,

300
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:11,900
WHEN THE GUMBO GETS THINNED
OUT, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH.

301
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,633
- I LIKE GUMBO, SO...

302
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:16,133
- HA HA HA!

303
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,900
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR YOU.

304
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,066
GET BACK TO IT.

305
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,367
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

306
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,500
HA HA HA!

307
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,834
DELA.

308
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:24,967
- HI, RU.

309
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,367
- SO THIS IS
A BIG CHALLENGE HERE.

310
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,700
- IT IS, YEAH.

311
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,633
- IS THIS CHALLENGE GONNA
ALLOW THE JUDGES TO SEE

312
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,266
THE REAL YOU?

313
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:35,300
- UM, I...I THINK SO.

314
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,333
I THINK IT'LL BE NICE TO
BE ABLE TO BE BRINGING SOME

315
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,734
VERSION OF THE CHARACTER,
BUT THEY CAN HAVE A GENUINE

316
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,300
CONVERSATION AND
REALLY BE LISTENING.

317
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,834
- RIGHT, AND BECAUSE DELA IS
A CHARACTER THAT YOU DO, I GET

318
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,900
A SENSE THAT YOU'RE
A BIT OF AN INTROVERT.

319
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,300
- I TEND TO BE
VERY PRIVATE MYSELF.

320
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,367
- SO THE QUESTION BECOMES,
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID

321
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,967
OF PEOPLE SEEING?

322
00:11:55,967 --> 00:12:00,500
- CERTAINLY, I CAN BE
MORE NEGATIVE, YOU KNOW.

323
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,600
I'VE STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION
A LOT IN MY LIFE, NOT FEELING

324
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,100
GOOD ENOUGH, NOT FEELING
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.

325
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,433
THIS CHARACTER IS SOMEBODY WHO
HELPED ME TO BE MORE POSITIVE,

326
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:15,500
AND I'M HOPING THAT NOW I CAN
HAVE HER LEARN FROM ME HOW TO,

327
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,934
YOU KNOW, HAVE MORE OF
THE HEART THAT I THINK THAT

328
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,333
THE JUDGES ARE DESCRIBING.

329
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,767
- ABSOLUTELY, I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ON THE MONEY THERE.

330
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:21,800
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.

331
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,066
- THANK YOU, RU.

332
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,734
- COURTNEY ACT.
- HOWDY, HOWDY.

333
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:26,867
- HOWDY, HOWDY.

334
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,433
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN INTERVIEW STAR.

335
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,567
- I KNOW. ISN'T
THAT EXCITING?

336
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,867
- TALK SHOW.
- YEAH.

337
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,400
I HAD A QUESTION.

338
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,934
I'VE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH FUN
IN THE COMPETITION,

339
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,400
AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE,
"OH, I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

340
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,734
I'M DOING A GOOD JOB."

341
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:41,266
AND THEN WHEN I GET TO THE
JUDGES, I KIND OF GET GOOD

342
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,967
FEEDBACK BUT A BIT
KIND OF LUKEWARM.

343
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:48,100
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF
YOU HAD ANY MAYBE SPECIFIC

344
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,533
POINTS OR THINGS THAT I
COULD PAY ATTENTION TO.

345
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,000
- YOU'RE VERY POLISHED.

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THAT, BUT
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR

347
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,433
ALSO HAS SOFT, TENDER
PARTS AND WHO'S ALSO AS

348
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,533
HARD AS STEEL.

349
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,700
- MMM.

350
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,967
- SO FULLY ROUNDED,

351
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,166
AND THIS IS THE
PERFECT CHALLENGE TO

352
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,767
PUT THAT TO THE TEST.

353
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:10,000
- RU'S ASKING ME TO GIVE
SOMETHING MORE, LIKE HUMANITY

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,633
AND VULNERABILITY, SO I NEED
TO WORK OUT HOW I CAN BRING

355
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,600
THAT INTO THE INTERVIEW.

356
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,533
- TRINITY K. BONET.

357
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,900
OH, MY GOODNESS,
THAT BREAKTHROUGH LAST WEEK.

358
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,467
YOU MUST FEEL ON TOP
OF THE WORLD.

359
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,734
- I DO. I DO.

360
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,900
- WHAT CAN YOU TAKE FROM
THAT BREAKTHROUGH AND APPLY TO

361
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,133
THIS CHALLENGE?

362
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,867
- I THINK THE ADVANTAGE OF
THIS CHALLENGE IS THAT I GET

363
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,967
TO BE MYSELF AND HAVE MY OWN
SENSE OF PERSONALITY AND PLAY

364
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,533
WITH THE QUESTIONS
THE WAY I CHOOSE TO.

365
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:39,734
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

366
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,033
- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

367
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,800
- YOU'VE COME VERY CLOSE,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T WON

368
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,934
A CHALLENGE YET.

369
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,667
- NO, AND THAT'S THE GOAL.

370
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,867
RU HAS GIVEN ME QUITE A FEW
CHANCES, SO NOW THAT I FEEL

371
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,800
LIKE I'M IN THE GAME, I
REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS.

372
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,367
- ALL RIGHT,
LADIES, GATHER ROUND.

373
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,667
NOW, TOMORROW ON THE MAIN STAGE,
WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR

WOMAN OF THE OCEAN, I'M REALLY

380
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,967
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

381
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,400
LIKE, HI, PAULA,
I'M A GIRL NOW.

382
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
- NOW, IN A FEW MOMENTS, YOU

383
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,333
LAUNCH YOUR TV
TALK SHOW CAREERS.

384
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,633
IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY BIG SHOW,

385
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,333
SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.

386
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,834
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

387
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,300
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S
A LOT TO JUGGLE.

388
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

389
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,166
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

390
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,567
- AND HE SAID THAT I'M VERY
POLISHED, BUT THEY'RE NOT

391
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,300
SEEING ANY HUMANNESS TO ME.

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,500
- LIKE, OBVIOUSLY, WE LOVE
PEOPLE WHO ARE, LIKE, GREAT

393
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,300
AT THINGS, BUT WE ALSO LOVE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WEAKNESSES.

394
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

395
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,033
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
RELATABLE, BUT YOU'RE

396
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,500
AN ALIEN, SO...

397
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,867
- [LAUGHS]

398
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:09,233
- I KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN
BE TOO POLISHED OR A LITTLE

399
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,700
BIT STEPFORDY.

400
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,600
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT
WILLING TO BE VULNERABLE,

401
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING,
I'M JUST HAPPY OR HAPPIER.

402
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,567
I CAN'T HELP IT.

403
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,133
THAT'S KIND OF HOW MY BRAIN
WORKS, OR I'VE--THROUGH A LOT

404
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:25,533
OF MEDITATION, I FIND THAT
MY LIFE IS VERY CAREFREE.

405
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,934
I HAVE, LIKE, A LOT OF
PASSION AND ENJOYMENT.

406
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:31,033

"THE RUPAUL SHOW."

421
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,567
HELLO, WELCOME TO

422
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,300
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.

AND I AM FILLING--
FILLING IN FOR RUPAUL TONIGHT.

AND GEORGIA HOLT.

428
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:27,133
THIS IS LIVE TV, SO I JUST AM
KIND OF SHAKING IN MY HEELS.

429
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,300
THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR.

430
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
LIKE, I'M FREAKING
OUT RIGHT NOW.

431
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,266
JUST SAY--OW, MY RING GOT

00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:37,600
HMM.

434
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,633
OH, OK.

435
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,700
WELL, LET ME
REFER TO MY NOTES.

436
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,133
I'M STILL FRESH.

437
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,700
SORRY.

438
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,033
SO I READ THAT YOU
WERE PERFORMING

439
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,500
AT THE AGE OF 7.

440
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,433
WERE YOU, LIKE, THE BIG,
LIKE, CHILDHOOD STAR OF YOUR,

441
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,767
LIKE, COMMUNITY?

442
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,200
- NO, HONEY, WE WERE
BROKE, AND IT WAS DURING

443
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,266
THE DEPRESSION.

444
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,700
- PARTY.

445
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
MY MOM ALWAYS PUSHES ME,
AND SO, LIKE, I WAS WONDERING,

446
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,133
WELL, DID YOU HAVE,
LIKE, A STAGE DADDY?

447
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,633
'CAUSE I CALL MY
MOM STAGE MAMA.

448
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:03,900
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

449
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,100
WE HAD NO MONEY.
- OH.

450
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,233
- AND THERE WAS NO FOOD.

451
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,367
SO I WOULD GO AND SING,
AND PEOPLE WOULD GIVE

452
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,734
ME NICKELS AND DIMES AND...

453
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:12,133
- RIGHT.

454
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,000
I'M HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME
WITH THIS TALK SHOW SHIT.

455
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,567
I DIDN'T KNOW SO
MUCH GOES INTO IT.

456
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,200
I THOUGHT YOU JUST
MEET YOUR GUEST,

457
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,367
YOU HAVE A PARTY,

458
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,133
YOU HAVE A CUTE LITTLE MUG.

459
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,266
I'M LIKE, "FUCK. SHIT'S
GETTING REAL."

460
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,567
OH, THAT'S AMAZING, THOUGH.

461
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:25,734
- IT WAS DURING
THE DEPRESSION.

462
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,367
- OK.
- YEP, YEAH.

463
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,867
- THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S SO COOL.

464
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:33,600
- IN YOUR ORIGINAL BOOK,
"FAMILY OUTING," YOU DISCUSSED

465
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
HOW AT 13 THAT
YOU FELT DIFFERENT.

466
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
- RIGHT.
- COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?

467
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,500
- SURE. AS MY
HORMONES STARTED TO GO,

468
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,800
I HAD AN ATTRACTION TOWARDS

469
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,266
WOMEN, AND SO I NATURALLY JUST
MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT I

470
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:48,266
MUST BE GAY AND THAT MUST BE
WHAT ALL THESE FEELINGS ARE.

471
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,633
- NOW, OF COURSE,
IN 1995, YOU CAME

472
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,700
OUT PUBLICLY.

473
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,000
WHAT WAS YOUR
FATHER'S THOUGHTS?

474
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,066
- HE WAS COMFORTABLE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST PERSON

475
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,967
IN THE FAMILY THAT I
TALKED TO WAS MY GRANDMA.

476
00:17:56,967 --> 00:18:00,200
- REALLY?

477
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,433
- AND, OF COURSE,
SHE WAS AMAZING.

478
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,266
- AND THEN
THE MAGICAL EXPERIENCE

479
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,400
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."

480
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,100
HOW WAS THAT?

481
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,767
- BIANCA TALKED TO ME
A LOT AND KIND OF IGNORED MY

482
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,834
GRANDMOTHER A LITTLE BIT, SO
I WAS THROWING HER THESE KIND

483
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:19,467
OF BALLS OF, LIKE, "HERE,
LET'S INCLUDE HER IN THIS."

484
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,400
- WAS IT LIBERATING TO
BE IN THAT MOMENT?

485
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,333
YOU KNOW, LEARNING THE DANCES
AND DEALING WITH ALL OF IT IS

486
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,800
PRETTY GREAT.

487
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,767
OH, GREAT, SO THE STAGE
MANAGER'S TELLING ME I'VE GOT

488
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,567
TO WRAP IT UP, AND I HAVEN'T
ASKED MISS GEORGIA ANYTHING.

489
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,166
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO,
SO VERY MUCH.

490
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,166
SHIT.
- HA HA HA!

491
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,233
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED, YOU KNOW.

492
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,900
NOT NERVOUS EXCITED,
BUT REALLY EXCITED.

493
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
AND I HAVE A TON OF
QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS.

494
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,033
WELL, CHAD.

495
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:47,333
CHAD, I KNOW THAT YOU DO A
LOT IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

496
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,333
- TRINITY KEPT CALLING ME
CHAD, AND GOLDEN RULE--YOU GOT

497
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,967
TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON
THAT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.

498
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,800
- OK, SO CHAD, ARE YOU
A BOXER OR BRIEF TYPE OF GUY?

499
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,500
- THAT, TO ME, WAS A PROBLEM.

500
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,667
- HA HA HA!

501
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:04,400
- CHAD, IF YOU HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT ON A--

502
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,700
ON A DATE WITH MEGAN FOX,
ANGELINA JOLIE, OR--

503
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,166
I NEED ONE MORE PERSON.

504
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,700
IT WAS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE.

505
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,667
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ME
OR IF IT WAS THEM.

506
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,533
THIS INTERVIEW WAS WEIRD.

507
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:25,800
HA HA. WELL, THANK YOU
CHAD BONO AND GEORGIA HOLT.

508
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,667
- GEORGIA, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE
JUST RELEASED YOUR FIRST

509
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,967
EVER ALBUM.

510
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:32,166
YOU RECORDED THE ALBUM 30 YEARS
AGO, AND THEN 30 YEARS

511
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,500
LATER, YOU FIND THESE TAPES.

512
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,867
THAT MUST BE KIND OF COOL.

513
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,367
- CHER ASKED ME, "MOM, WHAT'D
YOU DO WITH THOSE TAPES?"

514
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,000
AND I SAID, "HONEY, I THINK
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE."

515
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,533
- THIS MUST BE A PRETTY
WELL-ORGANIZED GARAGE.

516
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,433
LIKE, 30--
- HA HA HA!

517
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,333
- I MEAN, I'VE GOT THINGS
FROM, YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO

518
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,500
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

519
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,867
- I SAVE EVERYTHING.

520
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,266
- IT'S NOT AN EPISODE OF
"HOARDERS" WAITING TO HAPPEN,

521
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,533
I'M GUESSING. OR IS IT?

522
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,667
- NO.
- NO.

523
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,433
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE
THE DOCUMENTARY "BECOMING CHAZ."

524
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,734
- MM-HMM.

525
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,633
- AND WHAT WAS THE DECISION
THAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO

526
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,600
SO PUBLIC WITH SUCH
A PERSONAL THING?

527
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,433
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
A NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE I KNEW I

528
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,867
WAS TRANSGENDER BUT WAS AFRAID
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

529
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,967
AND SO IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR
ME TO KIND OF GIVE THAT BACK.

530
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:13,133
I FIGURED THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE
OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO ARE--

531
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,300
WHO ARE STUCK.

532
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,333
- THAT'S SO COOL.

533
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,433
- COURTNEY CAME ACROSS
VERY PROFESSIONAL

534
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,700
AND VERY LIKEABLE.

535
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,667
I THOUGHT SHE HAD A LOT OF
CHARM, DIDN'T YOU THINK, CHAZ?

536
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,934
- I DID, ABSOLUTELY.

537
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,233
- HA HA HA!
- NO.

538
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,467
I LOVE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.

539
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,433
A HUGE THING FOR
AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.

540
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,734
- SO, CHAZ, ARE THERE ANY KIND
OF TRAITS THAT YOU WOULD SAY

541
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,500
THAT YOU REALLY KIND OF
PULLED FROM YOUR MOTHER CHER?

542
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,333
- NO.

543
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,166
- NO? HEH.
UM, RIGHT.

544
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,700
NOW, BESIDES THE DROP IN THE
IQ AND REMEMBERING TO PUT THE

545
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,533
SEAT DOWN, HAS THEIR BEEN,
LIKE, HARD THINGS THAT YOU'VE

546
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,100
HAD TO, LIKE, ADJUST
TO NOW BEING A MAN?

547
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,233
- NO, NOT REALLY.

548
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,567
- HA HA HA!

549
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:57,033
- GEORGIA, ARE THERE ANYTHING
ABOUT, LIKE, THE MUSIC TODAY--

550
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,567
DO YOU--DO YOU CONSIDER,
LIKE, MAYBE DOING A TOUR

551
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,800
OF YOUR ALBUM?

552
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,934
- HA HA HA! NOT AT 87.

553
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,333
- NO?
- NO.

554
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:10,533
- RIGHT, AND I HAVE ONE MORE
QUESTION FOR YOU, MY DEAR.

555
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,500
ARE YOU...

556
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,400
♪ PURE CHEROKEE ♪

557
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
- HA HA!

558
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,166
I DON'T KNOW, SHE JUST
WAS FUN TO ME.

559
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,734
- BUT SHE SEEMED TO
BE GETTING THROWN.

560
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,500
JEWELRY SEEMED TO BE FALLING
OFF OF HER, AND SHE SEEMED

561
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,333
A LITTLE PHYSICALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

562
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:30,300
- WELL, GEORGIA, WHAT IS IT
LIKE TO HAVE AN ALBUM THAT YOU

563
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,500
RECORDED 31 YEARS AGO
HITTING THE CHARTS RIGHT NOW?

564
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,967
- IT FEELS FANTASTIC.

565
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,400
I STARTED IN SINGING WHEN I
WAS 6 DURING THE DEPRESSION.

566
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,600
- MY GOODNESS.

567
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,066
- YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO KNOW ANYTHING

568
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,367
ABOUT THE DEPRESSION.

569
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,500
- WELL, I'VE
EXPERIENCED OTHER KINDS

570
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,700
OF DEPRESSION, BUT...

571
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,834
- HA HA HA! VERY FUNNY.

572
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,133
- AND, NOW, CHAZ, YOU
ALSO HAVE A RECENT PROJECT,

573
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,533
"INDEPENDENCE DAY."

574
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,800
- YEAH, WE ACTUALLY
CLOSE TONIGHT.

575
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,767
- HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CHANCE
TO SEE CHAZ'S MUSICAL AT ALL?

576
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,633
- I HAVEN'T.
- IT'S CLOSING NIGHT.

577
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,934
- I KNOW IT.
I KNOW IT.

578
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,533
- COULD YOU MAYBE HUM
US A FEW BARS?

579
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,100
MAYBE GEORGIA WILL JUST--
MAYBE SHE COULD GET

580
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,867
A SNEAK PEEK RIGHT NOW?

581
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:01,934
- VERY FUNNY.

582
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,500
- I ACTUALLY REALLY
LIKED BENDELACREME.

583
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,633
I THOUGHT SHE ASKED SMART
AND INTERESTING QUESTIONS.

584
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,934
- THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.
- YOU WERE GOOD.

585
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,333
WELL DONE.
- WELL DONE.

586
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,367
- PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME OUT TWICE SINCE

587
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:16,367
COMING OUT OF CHER AND SOMEONE
WHO'S CAME BACK 66 YEARS

588
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:20,000
AFTER CHER CAME OUT OF HER.

589
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU

590
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,967
BETTER, GEORGIA.

591
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:23,967
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.

592
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,400
- REALLY?
- I LOVE YOUR CD.

593
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,266
"I'M JUST YOUR YESTERDAY"--
WILL THAT END UP ON CHER'S

594
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,233
NEW ALBUM?

595
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:29,266
- I DON'T KNOW.

596
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,166
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
RECORDING HER PART.

597
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,233
- OK.

598
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,367
- AND I DON'T REMEMBER
RECORDING MY PART.

599
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,533
- OK, WELL, I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT I HAD

600
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,367
FOR BREAKFAST TODAY,
SO WE'RE EVEN.

601
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,633
HEE HEE HEE. NOW, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR A LAST-MINUTE DECISION

602
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,433
AT THE ABORTION CLINIC,
THE WORLD WOULDN'T

603
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:44,533
HAVE KNOWN CHER.

604
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,900
ARE YOU PRO LIFE?

605
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,867
HAS YOUR STANCE CHANGED AT
ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME?

606
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,500
- I THINK--I ACTUALLY--
I DON'T--I REALLY DON'T

607
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,800
KNOW HOW I FEEL.

608
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,000
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSING TO ME, AND I WAS

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
TRYING TO THINK OF HOW
TO, YOU KNOW, RECOVER.

610
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,300
- YEAH, IT WAS PUTTING HER
ON THE SPOT IN A WAY THAT YOU

611
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,200
DON'T--YOU KNOW, WHY
WOULD YOU EVER ASK THAT?

612
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,433
- HEE HEE. I FEEL SOME REALLY
GOOD RAPPORT BETWEEN ME,

613
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,667
CHAZ, AND GEORGIA.

614
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,533
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE I'VE
KNOWN THEM ALL MY LIFE,

615
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,467

OPENING UP TO ME.

00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,400
[LAUGHTER]

687
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,533
- BE AFRAID.
- YES.

688
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,000
- BE VERY AFRAID.
- YES.

689
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,333
- I'M JUST BUZZING
DOWN THE RUNAWAY.

690
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,767
I'M FEELING THE FANTASY.

691
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,367
- SHE'S GOT SOME
FLY CHOREOGRAPHY.

692
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:03,000
- YEAH, SHE'S A FLY GIRL.

693
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
SHE BUGGING.

694
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,133
NEXT UP, BIANCA DEL RIO,
CHEETAH GIRL.

695
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,700
- CAN A QUEEN REALLY
CHANGE HER SPOTS?

696
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,900
- YOU KNOW THE SAYING--
BIG CATS ARE DANGEROUS,

697
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,834
BUT A LITTLE PUSSY
NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

698
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,100
- THAT IS SOME POINTER
SISTERS HAIR RIGHT THERE.

699
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
- SHE'S SO EXCITED.

700
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,567
- HMM.

701
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,800
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.

702
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
SHE'S A RED FOX.

703
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
- SHE'S A COCK.

704
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,066
- YES, SHE IS.

705
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,600
- OHH!

706
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,800
- I'VE GOT MY TALONS AND MY
FEATHERS, AND I'M SHOWING OFF

707
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,166
SOME SKIN, AND I'M FEELING
REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.

708
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:37,900
- I THINK IT'S SOME KIND
OF JUNGLE PUSSY...CAT.

709
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,467
[LAUGHTER]

710
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:44,100
- FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA,
TRINITY K. BONET, THE PHOENIX.

711
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,700
- SHE'S AWFULLY
PLUCKED TONIGHT.

712
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,900
- YES.

713
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,433
- I AM GIVING YOU BIRDS OF
A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER

714
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,800
RHYTHMS, AND I LOOK
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.

715
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
- DRESSED TO QUILL.

716
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
YOU BETTER SISSY THAT SQUAWK.

717
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,233
[LAUGHTER]

718
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,133
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.

719
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,633
- OH.
- MM.

720
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,000
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

721
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,967
HEAVEN MUST BE
MISSING AN ANGEL.

722
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,200
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THOSE WINGS.

723
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,467
- YES.

724
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,900
PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF.

725
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,233
- I'M GIVING
SOME REGAL EAGLE.

726
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:12,767
I WANT TO SEE THIS ON BLOGS.

727
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,166
I WANT TO SEE
THIS ON FACEBOOK.

728
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,867
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA
TOP THIS SHIT.

729
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:19,000
- MM, THINK I'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN.

730
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,266
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH.

731
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:23,200
BABY, THESE GIRLS ARE
GIVING PRODUCTION VALUE.

732
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,266
- OK.

733
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,533
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.

734
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,700
WELCOME, LADIES.

735
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
IT'S TIME FOR THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.

736
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,233
FIRST UP, DARIENNE LAKE.

737
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,834
- WELL, DARIENNE, IT'S COLDER
IN HERE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.

738
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,266
- OOH.

739
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,367
[LAUGHTER]

740
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:37,900
- TONIGHT YOUR
LOOK IS INSPIRED.

741
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,033
I LOVE THE GRAY HAIR,
AND YOUR FACE LOOKS GORGEOUS.

742
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,066
AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
YOU SEEMED REALLY NERVOUS.

743
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,433
- REALLY?
- YOU DID.

744
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:48,367
- YEAH, I GOT THE SENSE THAT
YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.

745
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,867
YOU CAME IN MIDDLE OF
THE PACK TO ME.

746
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,266
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT
UP, ADORE DELANO.

747
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,400
- HI.

748
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,934
- WHAT WILD LIFE ANIMAL
ARE YOU REPRESENTING?

749
00:27:56,934 --> 00:27:58,934
- LIKE, A PANTHER,
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO LOOK LIKE

750
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:00,533
A MORTAL KOMBAT CHARACTER.

751
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,467
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS LOOK.

752
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,734
LOVE THE FACE.

753
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:04,867
I LOVE YOUR MAKEUP.

754
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:07,834
I LOVE YOU, BUT ALL THESE
PIECES--IT'S JUST NOT

755
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,900
ELEVATING IT UP ENOUGH.

756
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,500
- I'M HEARING YOU CONVERSE.

757
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,533
I'M GOING,
"I KNOW THIS PERSON."

758
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,133
- SEASON 7 "AMERICAN"--

759
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:16,800
- YES, "AMERICAN IDOL."

760
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,367
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
BUT WHAT I'D LIKE IS TO

761
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,700
NOT SEE THIS MASK.

762
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,934
IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO
THE AMAZING PERSONALITY THAT I

763
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,400
REMEMBER SO WELL.

764
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,567
- YOU JUST SEEMED REALLY
NERVOUS DURING OUR INTERVIEW.

765
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,700
- I WAS.

766
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,300
- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
YOU WERE REALLY STRUGGLING

767
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,533
THROUGH IT.

768
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,400
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME,

769
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,934
FLY, FLY, FLY, FLY.

770
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,133
HA HA HA!

771
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,166
- I THINK YOU DID A GREAT
JOB WITH THE INTERVIEWS.

772
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,533
YOU WERE REALLY UP-TO-DATE
ON EVERYTHING THAT BOTH

773
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:44,633
OF US WERE DOING.

774
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,367
YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.

775
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,567
- THERE'S A SENSE OF
SOMETHING'S BEEN DROPPED,

776
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,867
AND IT'S SO MUCH
MORE ENDEARING.

777
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:53,834
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BLAME IT ON BIANCA DEL RIO.

778
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,133
- ALWAYS BLAMING ME.

779
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,500
[LAUGHTER]

780
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,700
- I LOVE HOW YOU DID THE BODY
PAINT AND THE FACE PAINT TO

781
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,867
MATCH WITH THE DRESS.

782
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:02,333
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT.
- THANK YOU.

783
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,066
- BUT WITH THE INTERVIEW,
YOU WEREN'T REALLY FOCUSING

784
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,166
ON THE OTHER PERSON THAT WAS
THERE, WHICH WAS MY GRANDMA.

785
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,767
- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR
MISS GEORGIA THAT I WANTED TO

786
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,900
ASK, BUT TIME MANAGEMENT
DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.

787
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,367
- IS THERE A QUESTION YOU'D
LIKE TO ASK GEORGIA NOW?

788
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,667
- WELL, I WANTED TO ASK
THEM IF THEY BELIEVE

789
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,033
IN LIFE AFTER LOVE.

790
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,734
[LAUGHTER]

791
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,200
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.

792
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,467
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX
ON THE RUNWAY.

793
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:23,600
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?

794
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,233
- I'M A GLAMAZONIAN
WARRIOR PRINCESS.

795
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,467
I'M FRIENDS WITH ALL
THE ANIMALS,

796
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,867
AND THEN I TAKE THEM,
AND I SKIN THEM ALIVE.

797
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,233
I'M THE DIANE SAWYER
OF THE JUNGLE.

798
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,800
- I'M NOT SEEING WHAT I
WANT FROM YOU WITH THIS.

799
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,967
IT'S NOT QUITE
ANIMAL ENOUGH.

800
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,400
- NOW, ON TO THE TALK SHOW.

801
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,734
YOU HAD ME WITH YOU, THEN
DECIDED TO GO ALL HARD NEWS.

802
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:48,667
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT ABORTION?

803
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,100
- UH...

804
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,900
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.

805
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,000
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.

806
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,233
- YOU SAY YOUR CHARACTER
SKINS ANIMALS ALIVE.

807
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:03,800
WELL, IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE
SKINNING YOUR GUESTS ALIVE.

808
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,800
- HA HA HA!

809
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
HA HA HA!

810
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,934
[ENGINE REVS]

811
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:14,734
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.

812
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,433
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.

813
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,734
- GEORGIA, WERE YOU OFFENDED?

814
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,433
- I WAS UNEASY.
IT MADE ME UNEASY.

815
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,700
- THAT WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF
MY BIGGEST MISTAKES I'VE EVER

816
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,066
MADE BECAUSE I JUST ADORE YOU,
AND IT BREAKS MY HEART, AND I

817
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:31,400
WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF
I IN ANY WAY OFFENDED YOU.

818
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,734
- THANK YOU, HONEY.
THANK YOU.

819
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:35,266
EVERYTHING YOU SAID WAS VERY
SWEET, AND I APPRECIATE IT.

820
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,467
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY GREAT UP UNTIL

821
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,100
THAT ONE REMARK.

822
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,767
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.

823
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,066
- HOWDY.

824
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:46,767
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH IN MY
HETEROSEXUALITY TO SAY WOW.

825
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,734
- HA HA AH!
YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE.

826
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,266
I LIKE HANCOCK.

827
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,200
[LAUGHTER]

828
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,600
- THE SECOND I SAW YOU ON
CAMERA, I WAS ENGAGED, AND I

829
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,767
FELT LIKE YOU WERE A
GIRLFRIEND, AND THAT'S REALLY

830
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:02,433
IMPORTANT TO A VIEWER TO FEEL
LIKE THEY CAN RELATE TO YOU.

831
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,900
- NEXT STOP, TRINITY K. BONET.

832
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,667
- YOUR WHOLE LOOK, EVERYTHING
IS SO WELL THOUGHT OUT.

833
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,133
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL--
JUST GORGEOUS.

834
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,700
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW...

835
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,066
RULE NUMBER ONE, WHEN YOU HAVE

836
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,467
A GUEST, YOU NEED
TO KNOW THEIR NAME.

837
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:20,700
YOU KEPT CALLING CHAZ "CHAD,"
AND THAT IN AND OF ITSELF

838
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,033
WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

839
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,800
- WHEN MY NERVES GET THE
BEST OF ME, IT TAKES A TOLL.

840
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,433
- TRINITY, HONEY, I
STARTED WORKING ON TELEVISION

841
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:31,066
IN 1949, BUT DOING
THE SHOW TODAY, I WAS NERVOUS,

842
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,467
AND I'M AN OLD PRO, YOU KNOW?

843
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:37,333
SO YOU'LL GET OVER IT,
AND YOU'LL BECOME SO PROUD.

844
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,066
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
THANK YOU.

845
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,433
- MM-HMM.

846
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,033
- I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

847
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,934
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,

848
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,266
THE JUDGES
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.

850
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,166
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US CHATTY CATHYS,

851
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,533
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

852
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,867
LET'S START WITH
DARIENNE LAKE.

853
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:58,667
- I LOVED HER COSTUME, BUT
HER INTERVIEW--I THINK THAT

854
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,000
THE NERVES GOT TO HER.

855
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,834
I REMEMBER THAT SHE GAVE
A CHER IMPERSONATION, AND IT WAS

856
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,233
LIKE YOU COULD HEAR CRICKETS.

857
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,567
[LAUGHTER]

858
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:08,000
- YEAH, I MEAN, GIVE ME,
YOU KNOW, CHAD MICHAELS OR--

859
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,567
- TOTALLY.
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

860
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:12,533
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
ADORE DELANO.

861
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:16,700
- I WAS HOPING TO SEE THAT
SAME SASSINESS AND SMART MOUTH

862
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,633
THAT I CAME TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH ON "AMERICAN IDOL,"

863
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,166
BUT I DIDN'T GET
TO SEE IT TODAY.

864
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,567
- SHE WAS SO NERVOUS,
SHE COULDN'T GROUND HERSELF.

865
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,934
I THINK SHE PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE HAD HER NOTES WRITTEN

866
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,934
SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T
BE CONFUSED.

867
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,133
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I
SAID 10 SECONDS AGO.

868
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:33,200
[LAUGHTER]

869
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,100
- SHE EPITOMIZES THAT YOUNG KID
WHO HASN'T QUITE CONNECTED

870
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,767
THE DOTS WITH HER TALENT, HER
INTELLECT, AND THIS CHALLENGE

871
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:42,266
REALLY SHOWED THAT, YOU KNOW.

872
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,500
YOU MAKE ONE MISSTEP, AND--

873
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,834
- AND THEN MERLE COMES BACK?

874
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,200
[LAUGHTER]

875
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,367
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME?

876
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,133
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO BENDELACREME.

877
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,433
- I THOUGHT HER
COSTUME WAS INCREDIBLE.

878
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:55,667
SHE EVIDENTLY HAS STUDIED
FLIES WALKING ACROSS

879
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,233
THE FLOOR, BECAUSE SHE
DID IT PERFECT.

880
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,867
- YEAH, WE'RE
SEEING BENDELA NOW.

881
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:03,467
THERE'S THIS WALL THAT'S
BEEN KIND OF KNOCKED DOWN,

882
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,467
AND THAT TRANSLATED
IN HER TALK SHOW.

883
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,934
DESPITE WEARING THE MOST
HIDEOUS COLOR EVER CREATED...

884
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,500
- HA HA HA!

885
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,100
- SHE WAS FANTASTIC.

886
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,400
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

887
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,133
BIANCA DEL RIO.

888
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:17,233
- THE THING ABOUT BIANCA
IS, SHE'S SO SMART

889
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,700
AND PROFESSIONAL THAT SHE MADE
IT ABOUT THAT, AND SHE FORGOT

890
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,333
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU

891
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,166
DO A TALK SHOW, LIKE
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT

892
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,567
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.

893
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:29,367
- YEAH, IT PROBABLY COMES
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO BEING MORE

894
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:32,467
OF A NIGHT CLUB HOST WHERE
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION TO THE

895
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:34,700
AUDIENCE, YOU REALLY DON'T
CARE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

896
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,934
HA HA HA!

897
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,867
- BUT THAT JUST TAKES A
LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE.

898
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:41,166
SHE'S GOT ALL THE IMPORTANT
INGREDIENTS TO DO THIS WELL IF

899
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,900
SHE WANTS TO DO
THIS PROFESSIONALLY.

900
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,266
- ALL RIGHT,
UP NEXT, JOSLYN FOX.

901
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,934
- THERE WAS NO ANIMAL
INTERPRETATION

902
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,200
IN THAT WHATSOEVER.

903
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,166
SHE STUCK SOME FEATHERS
ON HER HEAD AND...

904
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,367
- CALLED IT MACARONI.

905
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,567
- OK?

906
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,967
AND I DON'T GIVE
A FRIAR TUCK WHO YOU ARE.

907
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,100
YOU DON'T BE SHOWING
ME THAT WITH A MEATY TUCK

908
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,200
LIKE THAT.

909
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,567
- THAT WAS A MEATY TUCK.

910
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:02,066
- AS A TALK SHOW HOST, THE
BIGGEST THING WITH HER HOSTING

911
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,500
WAS HER LACK OF TACT,
ESPECIALLY

912
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,133
WITH SENSITIVE ISSUES.

913
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:09,133
- BUT WHAT I DO APPRECIATE
IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE DID

914
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,066
BRING THAT UP TO HER TODAY,
SHE WAS TEARFUL ABOUT IT,

915
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,400
AND I FELT THAT THAT
WAS VERY GENUINE OF HER.

916
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,266
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
COURTNEY ACT.

917
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:19,000
- DO THE OTHER QUEENS JUST
SHIT BACKSTAGE WHEN SHE PUTS

918
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,934
ON WHAT SHE'S GONNA PUT
ON FOR THE RUNWAY?

919
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,834
BECAUSE THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE.

920
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:26,734
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
I THOUGHT SHE DID A GOOD JOB,

921
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,367
BUT THEN ONE MINUTE IN,
SHE JUST PLUMMETED ENERGY-WISE.

922
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,133
- I DIDN'T FEEL
THE ENERGY DIP, HONESTLY.

923
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,333
- NOR DID I.

924
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,000
- IT WAS CONVERSATIONAL.
IT JUST WORKED.

925
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,300
- I AGREE.

926
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,533
I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS
VERY, VERY LIKEABLE AND FUN.

927
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:43,033
- I WOULD SAY THAT HER
AND BENDELACREME WERE MY TWO

928
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:44,600
FAVORITE, JUST NECK AND NECK.

929
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,200
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO TRINITY K. BONET.

930
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,367
- LOVED HER RUNWAY LOOK.

931
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,900
IT ALL WORKED TOGETHER.

932
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,800
- BUT IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO MAKE UP FOR HOW ABYSMAL HER

933
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,033
TALK SHOW WENT FOR HER.

934
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,100
- RIGHT.

935
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,667
WITH THE BIGGEST FAUX PAS
OF ALL, NOT KNOWING

936
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,900
THE GUEST'S NAME.

937
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,166
- HELLO, SHE CALLED HIM CHAD.

938
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,266
[LAUGHTER]

939
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,800
- SO RULE NUMBER ONE,
KNOW YOUR GUEST'S NAME.

940
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,567
- ALL RIGHT, SILENCE.

941
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,200
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

942
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,600
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.

943
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
[ENGINE REVS]

944
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,767
- HA HA HA!

945
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,200
HA HA HA!

946
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,934
[ENGINE REVS]

947
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,767
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

948
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:20,867
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.

949
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:26,767
BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU ARE SAFE.

950
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,367
BENDELACREME,
YOU ARE SAFE.

951
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:41,533
COURTNEY ACT, AS A TALK SHOW
HOST, YOU WERE UNFLAPPABLE,

952
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:46,266
AND ON THE MAIN STAGE,
YOU SOARED.

953
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,233
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THIS

954
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,433
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.

955
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:50,567
- THANK YOU.

956
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,867
[APPLAUSE]

957
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:55,166
- YOU'VE WON A WIG WARDROBE
FROM OUTFITTERS WIG

958
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:59,633
AND A YEAR'S SUPPLY
OF HAIR CARE FROM AQUAGE.

959
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:02,633
- SECOND WIN.

960
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:05,633
- DARIENNE LAKE...

961
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,266
YOU ARE SAFE.

962
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,300
ADORE DELANO.

963
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,533
YOU, MY DEAR, ARE
ONE WILD CHILD,

964
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:22,934
BUT IN THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE,
YOU WERE EATEN ALIVE.

965
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:28,400
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.

966
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,767
TRINITY K. BONET.

967
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:36,200
ON THE RUNWAY, YOU ARE
A FIERCE, FEATHERED FIREBIRD.

968
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,100
UNFORTUNATELY, ON THE TALK SHOW,
YOU LAID AN EGG.

969
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,834
JOSLYN FOX, YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE.

970
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:50,233
IN THE CHALLENGE, YOU PUT
YOUR HIGH-HEELED FOOT

971
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,567
IN YOUR MOUTH.

972
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,734
JOSLYN FOX...

973
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,367
YOU'RE SAFE.

974
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:01,734
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.

975
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:04,100
TRINITY, I'M SORRY,
MY DEAR, BUT YOU ARE UP

976
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,567
FOR ELIMINATION.

977
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,867
- I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN TRINITY SEND A LOT

978
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,233
OF BITCHES HOME WITH HER
LIP SYNC SINCE SHE TURNS IT

979
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,400
THE FUCK OUT.

980
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA FAINT.

981
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,767
- LADIES, PRIOR TO TONIGHT,
YOU WERE ASKED TO PREPARE

982
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:26,033
A LIP-SYNCH PERFORMANCE OF
VIBEOLOGY BY PAULA ABDUL.

983
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:31,100
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO
IMPRESS ME AND SAVE YOURSELF

984
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,166
FROM ELIMINATION.

985
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:44,400
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.

986
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,100
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

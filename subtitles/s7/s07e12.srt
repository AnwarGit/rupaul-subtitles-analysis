I didn't even know who my father was.

So how could he know anything about me?

146

147

00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,607
[whispering] Trying on their shit.

167
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,979
While Kennedy and I completely appreciate

168
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,215
what these kids are trying to do
with their modern take on drag,

169
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,686
old-school is the only school, honey.

170
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,755
They're in the corner playing dress-up
like it's kindergarten.

171
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,157
It's a walk-off.

172
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,327
[Pearl humming]

173
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,063
[whispering] Shut the fuck up...

174
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,300
{\an8}Ginger and Kennedy's final runway looks
are a mystery

175
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,737
{\an8}except for huge, gigantic
pageant girl hair.

176
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,808
<i>They're competing</i>
<i>for who can have the biggest hair </i>

177
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,278
on top of who is
America's next drag superstar.

178
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,714
All this bullshit
and they pulling out sleepers.

179
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,949
It will be comfortable
for their plane ride home.

180
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,788
{\an8}This is your time to make a statement.

181
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,124
<i>And the shit you pulling out...</i>

182
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,095
Girl...

183
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,897
-Hi.
-Violet, darling.

184
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,966
So when you auditioned for the show,

185
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,335
how far did you imagine yourself coming?

186
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,205
Oh, the winner. The crown... Girl.

187
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,508
Where did you get this confidence?
You have a lot of it.

188
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,012
Growing up, I was put
on the back burner for sure.

189
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,748
My sister had lots of stuff
she was going through.

190
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,518
I had to be my own support system,
my own biggest fan, so...

191
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,620
It sounds kind of lonely.

192
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,190
There's really no shoulder
for Violet to cry on.

193
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,692
-Besides my own.
-Right.

194
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,428
That's what you're showing
in this competition,

195
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,364
because you won
shadiest queen, remember?

196
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,600
-Did I?
-Did that hurt your feelings?

197
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,802
Kind of, but I knew that wasn't the case.

198
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,639
I was like, "I need to work harder
to show these girls who I really am."

199
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,409
I think the biggest thing
that I've learned

200
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,111
is to just be aware
of your first impressions,

201
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,749
because it could be difficult
to change someone's first impression.

202
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:28,487
I know that you're only 22, and you think,
"Well, a lot of people have this."

203
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,457
Let me tell you,
a lot of people don't have it.

204
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,726
You are really special.

205
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,063
A lot of people will take a lifetime
to get where you are.

206
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,532
-Thank you so much, Ru.
-Thank you.

207
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,170
-Pearl, darling, welcome to lunch.
-Thank you.

208
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,706
-Did you think you'd make it this far?
-Uh-uh.

209
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,941
You didn't? Have you surprised yourself?

210
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:53,179
I surprised myself coming in here
and retreating into "my shell."

211
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,048
I've never had these moments
of clamming up.

212
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,417
You were ready to tap out at one point.

213
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,420
I definitely was hurting, yeah.

214
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,489
But I'm all bark and no bite.

215
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,326
The thing is that I know your potential,
and I wanted to see it,

216
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,496
and I was feeling that it wasn't there.

217
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,998
-What was baby Pearl like?
-Baby Pearl?

218
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,835
-Yeah. Like, say, seven years old.
-Oh...

219
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,370
God!

220
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,441
When I was seven, you know,
I was scared shitless all the time.

221
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,645
I was going through
some pretty traumatic times.

222
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:31,817
It was just mental, emotional, physical,
psychological torment every day.

223
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:37,990
That's pretty rough. When I first met you,
I felt there was something else going on,

224
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,961
-and it felt like a traumatic issue to me.
-Yeah.

225
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,797
I'm not the kind of person
that opens up a lot.

226
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:51,170
So every time I do, it makes the weight
feel a bit more lifted off my shoulders.

227
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,606
Oh boy, has there been
a transformation in you.

228
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,342
At this point,
nothing can break my spirit.

229
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,611
Good. Well, condragulations.

-The last day.

343
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,783
It is the last time
that we are entering the workroom,

344
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,219
and at this point in the competition,

345
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,456
we're pretty much evenly divided
right down the middle.

346
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:22,995
On one end of the room, you have
Violet and Pearl, the "pretty girls,"

347
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,697

We don't call them that.

350
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,240
[Ginger Minj] I want to know
your first impressions that first day.

351
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,011
Pearl, when she came in,
and she was like, "Um,

352
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,381
I have a face chin on,
and blah, blah, blah."

353
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,450
-I was like, "This stupid bitch."
-"She's stoned."

354
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,819
"She's high as a kite out of her mind,"

355
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,290
so I guess my first impression
of Pearl was kind of spot-on.

356
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,225
Violet...

357
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,564
My first impression of you
is that, I mean,

358
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,932
you was full of yourself.

359
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,171
And has that changed?
No, it hasn't because...

360
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,974
because you haven't let it die down.

361
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,178
So I do respect you,
but still think you full of yourself.

362
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:18,817
I just feel like you are too young
to take on this type of responsibility.

363
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,655
I agree with Kennedy. It's a level
of maturity that you haven't reached yet.

364

[Kennedy] Thank you.

like you've been in this game long enough

00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:44,710
to know that you must step out of Violet
and be professional about some situations.

370
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,880
And I don't feel like you've been there.
You're not there yet.

Okay, I understand
more of what you're saying.

372
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,957
You don't want to be known
as being a bitch.

373

[Violet] That's it.

374
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,496
Violet is different.
In the beginning, she would be like,

375
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,299
"Fuck you.
I don't give a fuck what you think."

00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,216
You told the story beautifully.

494

Don't take this as shade,

495
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,655
-but did you run out of clothes?
-Oh, God, no.

496
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,392
Because for me,
this does not say "Violet's best drag."

497
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,796
It's a natural progression.
I think I get what you're doing.

00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,199
-I think you do too.
-Okay, thanks.

Dancing is not your strong suit,

In this particular challenge, you pushed

You gave us three definable characters.

Then with the dancing, you don't move,

525

[RuPaul] Ladies, final question.

530
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,512
Why should you, and not your competitors,

531
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,382
be crowned America's next drag superstar?

532
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,985
We'll start with Kennedy.

533
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:58,756
I've been in this business
for 17 long years,

534
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,527
and I condone myself with professionalism.

535
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,963
As far as my competitors,

536
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,400
with the exception of Ginger,
I don't think the other girls are ready.

537
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,071
So I fear that they may not know
how to condone themselves.

538
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:17,909
That makes me think, "What do you have
to offer once you become the queen?"

539
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,744
And it's not much.

540
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,080
[RuPaul] Thank you, Kennedy.

541
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,148
All right, Violet Chachki.

542
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,719
I already feel like I am
America's next drag superstar.

543
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,021
I've been telling myself that
for a long time.

544
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:35,793
I've always looked up to myself. The only
validation I need is from this show.

545
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:41,199
As far as my competitors go, I feel
like I represent the past, the present,

546
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,201
but more than anything, the future.

547
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,537
-Thank you, Violet.
-Thank you.

548
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,539
-All right, Ginger.
-If I could,

549
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,409
I'd split this with Kennedy.
I'd say, "Crown us both.

550
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,812
We'll get conjoined twin gowns,
and we'll wear them all year."

551
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,016
But my other two sisters,
as much as I do love them,

552
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,885
Violet has the shortest temper
I've ever seen.

553
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,589
And that's a problem
when you're dealing with the world.

554
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:10,094
And Pearl, as much as she has grown,
was ready to walk away

555
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,030
from a golden opportunity.

556
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:18,136
Not to mention this is America,
land of the free, home of the fat people,

557
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,405
and if we supersize our French fries,

558
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,341
why can't we at least supersize
our next drag superstar?

559
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,777
Thank you, Ginger.

560
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:30,281
-All right, Pearl.
-I've busted my fucking ass my entire life

561
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,751
for everything that I have,

562
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,855
every article of clothing,
every rent payment.

563
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,427
You've been telling me how exhausted
I come off, and it's because I am...

564
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,196
from life. Yes,

565
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:51,135
I totally had a moment on this show
where I didn't think that I could go on.

566
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,173
But that doesn't define
what I've done on this show.

567
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,110
I do not like to keep myself limited
into some kind of drag box,

568
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,814
and I have so much more to show America.

569
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,615
Thank you, Pearl.

570
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,252
Now, while you untuck backstage,

571
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,355
the judges and I will deliberate.

572
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:16,327
All right,
just between us squirrel friends,

573
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:20,031
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.

574
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,734
Her dancing was amazing.
She got rhythm.

575
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,337
And she is a great representation
of glamorous drag.

576
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,508
She's a hard worker,
and she is the professional of the group.

577
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,711
If she's the pro,
why wasn't that speech professional?

578
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,513
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>

579
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,517
She's not a dancer, but she gave it
all she's got. She did a great lip sync.

580
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,920
And as far as her acting goes,
I was really proud of her.

581
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,457
She has told such a story
in her looks constantly.

582
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,327
I believe that she had
this last outfit planned all along.

583
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,430
That is not the best look.
Don't try to convince me.

584
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,467
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Not a great dancer, but fine.

585
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,670
But she can give you comedy,
glamour, acting, and singing.

586
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,472
<i>She's a quadruple threat.</i>

587
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,343
She offers something different.
I grew up as a full-figured young boy.

588
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,348
And it does say something to kids
in small towns who may be chubby

589
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,917
that there's a chance
that they could rise to the top.

590
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,485
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>

591
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,489
At a certain point, we were all like,
"Check, please. I'm out."

592
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,794
But here she is in the top four
of this competition. That is so difficult.

593
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,998
{\an8}And she fought her way back. 
And she made me fall in love with her.

594
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,300
She does have a boozy charm.

595
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,638
And it's star quality that she has
where you're intrigued, you know.

596
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:38,609
But is it too off-putting,
the sort of distance, for a fan

597
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,479
-to fall in love with her?
-I think they'll love her.

598
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,315
One more topic we need to discuss.

599
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:48,586
Michelle Visage. Carson, pros and cons.

600
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,256
Ah, you're funny.

601
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,726

who makes it to the top three,

604
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:09,941
this is your last chance to impress me

605
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:14,245
and save yourself from elimination.

The time has come...

607
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,785

Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy.

656
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,703
[laughs]

657
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,774
I present to the world my final three.

658
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,144
All season long
I've consulted with the judges.

659
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,514
Now I want to hear from you, the fans.

660
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,951
Who do you think should be
America's next drag superstar?

661
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,321
{\an8}Are you team Ginger,

662
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,891
{\an8}team Pearl, or team Violet?

663
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:53,397
{\an8}Tweet your choice to:
@RuPaulsDragRace, #DragRace,

664
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:58,469
{\an8}and keep the conversation going
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> Facebook page.

665
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,906
Let your voice be heard. But remember,

666
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,942
the final decision is mine to make.

667
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,546
So tune in next week
to see the world debut

668
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,948
of the music video <i>Born Naked</i>.

669
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,086
And the week after that,
I will crown a winner

670
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,190
at the grand finale of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.

671
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,026
Now, remember, if you can't love yourself,

672
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,795
how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?

673
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,898
{\an8}-Can I get an "amen" up in here?
-Amen!

674
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,034
{\an8}All right. Now, let the music play.

00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,604

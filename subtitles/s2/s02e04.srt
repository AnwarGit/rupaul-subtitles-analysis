- Our next item...

184
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,667
a roll of duct tape.

185
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,667
Not only used for tucking
your tender parts,

186
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,600
but also an essential

187
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,400
for any aspiring
MacGyver of drags.

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,166
Tyra, what's your guess?

189
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,767
- $2.98.

190
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:01,934
- Al right, Sonique?

191
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,800
- I'm gonna say $4.00.

192
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,433
- All right, Tatianna?

193
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,266
- $3.75.

194
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:10,834
- The correct price is...

195
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,367
$6.98.

196
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,834
Sonique is the winner!

197
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,433
Congratulations, Sonique.

198
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,633
The Queen is Right!

199
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,367
[applause]

200
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,734
- Sonique ended up winning.

201
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,633
Boo.

202
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,533
- All right, ladies,
here we go.

203
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,967
Our showcase throwdown
is designed

204
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,734
for a lady-boy night
on the town.

205
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,367
Starting with a pair of genuine
brass knuckles.

206
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,834
Now what lady-boy
night on the town

207
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,600
would be complete without
a can of...

208
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
♪ Pepper spray ♪

209
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,367
With its own cute little
carrying case.

210
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,934
Perfect for the drag queen
on the go.

211
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:55,066
And finally, a brand-new wig!

212
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,367
And not just any wig,
but a lace front wig

213
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,166
made of real human hair

214
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,400
courtesy of Wig Pro Collections.

215
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,533
Now you need to bid
what you think

216
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:12,100
all three of these items cost.

217
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,867
Whoever comes closest
without going over

218
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,367
will win the total package.

219
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:20,433
Let's start with Sonique.

220
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,066
- $225.01.

221
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,066
- Jessica?

222
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,266
- $390.

223
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,467
- Raven, it's come down to you.

224
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:33,066
- I'm going with $395.

225
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,200
- The correct price is...

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,600
$1,283.90.

227
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Raven, you are the winner!

228
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,767
- Yeah!
- Yes!

229
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:47,200
- Raven, you get
the whole package

230
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,934
and a phone call home to mama.

231
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:51,900
- Yes!

232
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm excited to get to call
my mom.

233
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't need the wig.

234
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,900
I don't need the pepper spray.

235
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,734
But calling my mom is golden
to me.

236
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,266
- It's time for your
main challenge.

237
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,300
This week, you'll be guest stars
on a game show

238
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,633
I like to call
Snatch Game.

239
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,266
And in the great tradition
of drag,

240
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,300
you'll be asked to appear

241
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,767
doing your best
celebrity impersonations.

242
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:16,800
- Wow.

243
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,066
That is fierce.

244
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,800
- You'll be judged on your
look, precision, and wit.

245
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,066
And it really helps if you can
make us laugh.

246
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:29,066
So, gentlemen, start your
engines

247
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:32,467
and may the best
Liza, terrific win.

248
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,934
[laughs]

249
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:36,967
[applause]

250
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,133
[phone trilling]

251
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,133
- Hello?

252
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,200
- Mom?

253
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,867
My biggest inspiration for drag
is my mom.

254
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:44,867
Mom.

255
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,066
- [indistinct]

256
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,467
- Mother?

257
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,066
- Hello?

258
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,200
- Hello, mom.

259
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
- Oh, hi.

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,433
- How are you?

261
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,433
My mother is the most perfect
person in the world.

262
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,433
And how's church?

263
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,500
- It's fantastic.

264
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,600
Been praying for you every
night, so--

265
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,667
and every day.

266
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,133
- I love you.
Give my love to everyone.

267
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,333
- I will.
Okay, bye-bye.

268
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,333
- Bye.

269
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,700
Being able to talk to her,

270
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,100
it brought me to a place
where I feel confident again.

271
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,700
Mom can always do that.

272
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,000
- So who does everybody think

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,367
they're going to impersonate?

274
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,367
Who?

275
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,333
- Who do you--

276
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,667
- I'm doing Beyoncé, so...

277
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,533
- I'm gonna be Bey.

278
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,467
Beyonce is sort of just like me.

279
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, I basically have my look
together, I think.

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,967
- They didn't give us much time
for this one.

281
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,100
- I know, right?

282
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,633
- I actually have never

283
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,433
impersonated a celebrity before.

284
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,834
So, Jessica...

285
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:33,834
- Yes?

286
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,367
- Who do you usually, um, do?

287
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,867
- I always perform as myself,

288
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,367
you know, Jessica Wild.

289
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,333
- Same with me.

290
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,400
I just do Tatianna.

291
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,700
Tatianna is the character.

292
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,166
I was like,

293
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,100
"What am I going to do?"

294
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,767
- Our main challenge is the
Snatch Game,

295
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,166
and Rupaul told us to dress up

296
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,867
like our
celebrity impersonations

297
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,633
and get ready to
make people laugh.

298
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,867
Sonique, what made you decide
to do Gaga instead of Madonna?

299
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,233
- I don't have a madonna.

300
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,333
- You look like her.

301
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,633
You could borrow
from every girl.

302
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:11,233
I guarantee you would
find something.

303
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,166
- My first choice, of course,
would be Pink.

304
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,500
- I'm doing Pink.

305
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,934
Pink is my number one character.

306
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,834
I love her, and I do
a really good, you know,

307
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:20,800
illusion of it.

308
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,900
- I mean, I love Pink,

309
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,767
but I don't need to do her

310
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,300
every time I go on stage.

311
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,900
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

312
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,133
- I did not hear
a word you said.

313
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,066
- I base Sonique off of Pink.

314
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,066
That whole rocker kind of image.

315
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,600
I just--I really like Lady Gaga,

316
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,133
and I want to go for that.

317
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:40,467
- You better work it out, girl.

318
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,233
- Hello, hello, hello!

319
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,967
- Hi.

320
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,700
- Hey, squirrel-friends.

321
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
- Hello.

322
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
- Got a nut for another

323
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
squirrel-friend?

324
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,834
- There's plenty of nuts to go
around, babe.

325
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,600
- [chuckles]
I bet.

326
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
So, Morgan, who are you?

327
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,934
Who have you chosen as your

328
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,100
celebrity impersonation?

329
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,967
- I have chosen Pink
as my celebrity.

330
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,367
She's, like,
the number one for me.

331
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,300
- How would you describe
Pink's personality?

332
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,400
- She stands up
for good things.

333
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,533
Like, she uses her celebrity
for, you know,

334
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,100
PETA and against
animal cruelty

335
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,600
and things like that,
so, you know?

336
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,800
- Well, PETA's sort of a tough
joke to sell in Snatch Game.

337
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,967
- But she's funny.

338
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,400
- I trust you have a plan.

339
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Sonique-ka-nika-nika-nika.

340
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,066
Who are you doing?

341
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,166
- I want to do Lady Gaga.

342
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,100
- Lady Gaga?
- I love her.

343
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,300
- You know, I was on the fence
about her

344
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
until she did that
interview where they said,

345
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,567
"What are you looking for
in a boyfriend?"

346
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,266
and she said...

347
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,533
"A big cock."

348
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,266
- [chuckles]

349
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,900
It'll be really easy for me
to channel Lady Gaga

350
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,233
'cause I'll say
what's on my mind

351
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,066
and hopefully
it'll make you laugh.

352
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,166
- [chuckles]

353
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,367
All right, Sonique.

354
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,667
I expect to be gagging
on your Gaga.

355
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,867
Tatianna, now,
who are you gonna be?

356
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,166
- I think I'm doing Britney.

357
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,166
- ♪ Britney ♪

358
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,567
- Britney Spears.

359
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,967
- What does Britney do?

360
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,066
- [smacks gum]

361
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,600
- Chew gum?
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
- Ahh.

363
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
She does this thing with her--

364
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,700
she'll go...like that,

365
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,734
which is really--

366
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:07,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,800
That's it! That's it!

368
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,967
Are we gonna see that?

369
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,500
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.

370
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
- And some hair flips?

371
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,734
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:18,433
- I want to know who left
my hair out here?

374
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,667
- Me.

375
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:23,734
I'm gonna be the supermodel
of the world Rupaul.

376
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,333
- [laughs]

377
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,734
You little thief.

378
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:30,667
Eve Harrington.

379
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,800
Trying to steal my show,
are you?

380
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,934
- [laughs]

381
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:37,166
- What are some of the
signature Rupaul things?

382
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,767
- You open your eyes like this.

383
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,433
- That's usually a sign
that I have gas, actually.

384
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,533
Now some people would say it's
kind of risky

385
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,266
to do an impersonation
of a person

386
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:50,767
who's gonna be in the room
with you.

387
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:51,767
- Yes.

388
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:52,734
I know, but I can say,

389
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:56,066
"I did Rupaul
in front of Rupaul."

390
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,066
And you're going to have a lot
of fun

391
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:01,500
looking that Latina
making you.

392
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,633
- All right, go back to work.

393
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,300
- Yeah, you better work, bitch.

394
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,967
- Pandora Boxx.

395
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:08,967
Come over here, girl.

396
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,066
I wanna talk to you.

397
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:10,934
- Okay.

398
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,066
I'm gonna be Carol Channing.

399
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,767
- Carol Channing?
- Carol Channing.

400
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,333
- [dramatic gasp]
Yay!

401
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,166
Thank you, Jesus!

402
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,433
Thank you!

403
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,400
"Corn?

404
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,333
I don't remember eating corn."

405
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,667
- [laughing]

406
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,266
- Are you doing<i> Hello, Dolly!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Carol?

407
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,700
Are you doing<i> Love Boat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Carol?</i>

408
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,967
Are you doing "raspberries!"?

409
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,266
- I think I'm doing kind of
like the raspberries era,

410
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,066
because I don't have the big,
crazy glasses.

411
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,066
So, you know,
you can't do, like,

412
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,500
modern Carol without those huge,
like--

413
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,100
- Right.
- Like, saucer glasses.

414
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
- Yes.

415
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,200
Thank you, miss channing.

416
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,266
- Thank you.

417
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,533
- Look how gorgeous!

418
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,066
My goodness, the blending.

419
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,200
- Yes, girl.
- It's severe up in here.

420
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,166
Who are you doing?

421
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,600
- I'm gonna do Paris Hilton.

422
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,567
- Why'd you choose her?

423
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,300
- She's fun to make fun of.

424
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,400
- Yes.

425
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,734
Now you've been up for
elimination twice.

426
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,533
- I'm over it.
- You are over it.

427
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,600
- I don't wanna do it again.

428
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,967
- So you're putting
all your eggs

429
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,200
in Paris Hilton's big basket.

430
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,166
- Yes.

431
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm trying.

432
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,433
We'll see what happens.

433
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,900
- All right.
Good luck, Paris.

434
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,133
- Thank you.

435
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,300
- All right, I'm gonna scoot
around over here.

436
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,066
Ooh, how "purdy".

437
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,533
And who are you doing today?

438
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,633
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,

439
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,567
but technically
I'm doing Beyoncé.

440
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,333
- Now, Santino mentioned
the other day

441
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,266
that you should
work on your voice.

442
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,600
- When he said it, I thought
that maybe--

443
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
maybe he's right.

444
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
If it's a beautiful person,

445
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,200
it should be, like,
a beautiful voice with it.

446
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,834
- Listen, you know, your voice
worked

447
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,300
for Bea Arthur
and Weezy Jefferson.

448
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
All right, Tyra.
- Thank you.

449
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
- Thank you.

450
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,767
- Sahara Davenport.

451
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,700
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Hi, mommy.

452
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,967
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.

453
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,133
- Good, good, good.

454
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,567
- Who are you impersonating?
- Whitney Houston.

455
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,100
- Whitney!

456
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
Now, are you gonna be<i> Being</i>
<i>Bobby Brown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Whitney Houston,</i>

457
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,266
or are you gonna be Clive Davis'
Whitney Houston?

458
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,767
- I think<i> Being Bobby Brown's</i>

459
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,166
Whitney is a little more fun.

460
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,500
- [laughing]

461
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Bobby Christina!

462
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,467
- Bobby!

463
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,533
- [laughing]

464
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,166
- Well, I'm so glad that
Whitney's back,

465
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,667
and she's on our show.

466
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,667
- [laughing]

467
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,967
Word, so am i.

468
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,367
- Hey, Jujubee.
- Hi, momma.

469
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,700
- Are you preparing for your
Snatch Game?

470
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
- Yes, I am.

471
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
- Who are you impersonating?

472
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,667
- Kimora Lee.

473
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,834
- You're doing Kimora Lee?

474
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,300
What is she like?

475
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,734
- She's a business woman,

476
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,100
she's a supermodel,
she's a mommy.

477
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,567
So she's kind of like
a chameleon.

478
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,300
- Where do you get your
sense of humor from?

479
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,367
- My father passing away.

480
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,600
You never know when somebody's
gonna leave you.

481
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,066
So you treat every day
like it's your last day.

482
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:40,467
Amd you just give the best that
you can give, you know?

483
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,934
- And that's why
the sense of humor?

484
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,967
- Yeah, of course.

485
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:43,900
Why not?

486
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,200
- All right,
you get back to work.

487
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,367
I can't wait to see your
Kimora Lee.

488
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,867
- I can't wait either, girl.

489
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,800
- [laughing]

490
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,066
All right, ladies, the Snatch
Game is about to begin.

491
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,066
Now, this is your opportunity
to steal the spotlight.

492
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,500
Ham it up and make us laugh.

493
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,200
Now the queen with the best
celebrity charisma, uniqueness,

494
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,333
nerve, and talent will win
the challenge.

495
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh, and one other thing...

496
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,967
don't fuck it up.

497
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,967
All right, I'll see you all
later, good luck.

498
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,133
all: Bye.

499
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,066
- Bye.

500
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,834
What do I need to do first?

501
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,800
I need to tuck my hoo-hoo away.

502
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
I decided I was going to emulate
Britney Spears,

503
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,467
but I had no
idea what I was going to wear.

504
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,800
- What wig are you wearing?
- That one.

505
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,066
Blonde wavy, and then I'm gonna
put a fedora on top of it.

506
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,533
- The wig she was wearing was
just, like, three hairs.

507
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,767
- I have a better blonde wig
if you wanna use it.

508
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,734
It's just fuller.

509
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,367
- It's fuller?
- Yeah.

510
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,367
- Whatever works, definitely.

511
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,734
Thank you.

512
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,200
Morgan, surprisingly enough,
let me borrow one of her wigs.

513
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,900
Is this what you use
for your Britney?

514
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,066
- No, I left my Britney wig
at home.

515
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,533
- I think it might've come
from the fact

516
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,934
that she didn't think
I was going to be a threat.

517
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:55,800
So might as well let her--
you know, throw her a bone.

518
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,333
Yeah?
Cool.

519
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,333
I think Morgan needs to be

520
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,633
knocked off her high horse,

521
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:02,500
and I think that that will
happen with this challenge.

522
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Yay!

523
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,266
[laughing]

524
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,433
[applause]

525
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,367
- Hello, everybody!

526
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:13,567
Welcome to an all-star edition
of Snatch Game 2010.

527
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,066
I'm your host Rupaul.

528
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,467
Let's get to know our
contestants.

529
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:21,834
She's an actress, model,
and a red carpet favorite.

530
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,900
Phoebe Price is here.

531
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Hello, Phoebe.

532
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,934
- Thank you.

533
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:26,100
Thank you for having me.

534
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,266
- He's a talented actor,
comedian, and housewife.

535
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,834
Welcome<i> Ugly Betty's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Alec Mapa.</i>

536
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,967
Hey, Alec.
- Hi, Ru.

537
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,834
This is a master class in
staying in character.

538
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,800
When you see a really good
queen do it,

539
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,867
you realize that
the clothing and the wig

540
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,200
is the last thing
that has anything to do

541
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,266
with bringing forth
the essence of this person.

542
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:50,867
- Let's say hello to our
fabulous celebrity panel.

543
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,633
First up, Carol Channing
is here.

544
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,066
- It's great to be here,
wherever I am.

545
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,066
- [laughing]

546
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,367
- All right, next up
we have Pink.

547
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,367
Hey, Pink.

548
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,633
- Rock and roll, baby.

549
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,667
- Now, I've never seen you on
a game show before.

550
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,900
Is this your first one?

551
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,767
- This is my first--well,
it's not my first one,

552
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,767
but it's my
first game show.

553
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:08,700
- Kimora Lee Simmons.

554
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,367
Now I know that you're not
Simmons anymore.

555
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,700
- We don't wanna talk
about that.

556
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,100
- You don't wanna talk
about that.

557
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
- It's personal.

558
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,533
- Up next we have Lady Gaga.

559
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,233
Look at your poker face,
darling.

560
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,467
- Trust.

561
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:25,400
- We have Rupaul.

562
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,467
Hey, Rupaul, how are you?

563
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,533
Rupaul?

564
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,533
Miss Rupaul?

565
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,633
- Oh, hello, darling!

566
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,900
- [laughing]

567
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,934
- How are you?

568
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,300
[laughing]

569
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,367
How are you?

570
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,834
I said I'm going to do Rupaul.

571
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,100
And I'm going to have fun,

572
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
and I hope Rupaul will have fun

573
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,934
with my character, too.

574
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,667
- Oh, boy, you look gorgeous.

575
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,433
- Rupaul is very professional
when she's in drag.

576
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,767
Rupaul doesn't just get up
and start walking

577
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:56,500
and running and singing.

578
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,734
- All right, Paris Hilton
is here.

579
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:00,967
You have a line of clothing,

580
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,000
you have perfumes,
you have shoes.

581
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100
- I didn't know that I had
shoes out there.

582
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,367
- Yes, you do.

583
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,333
She's made a big comeback,

584
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,767
Whitney Houston is here.

585
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,800
- I'm so excited to be with all
these lovely divas.

586
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes, ma'am.

587
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,900
But let's not forget,
I am the original diva.

588
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,800
- Yes, you are.

589
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,934
Give her a big round
of applause.

590
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:19,934
- Thank you.

591
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,567
I love you much.
I love you much.

592
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,033
- Whitney's back.

593
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,133
- Ha!

594
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,900
- All right, next to Whitney,
of course...

595
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Britney Spears is here!

596
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,633
- Hey, y'all.

597
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,000
- So happy to have you
on the show.

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,233
What's your favorite game?

599
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,266
- Oh, goodness, I like playing
hide the cucumber.

600
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,200
I love that one.

601
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,767
- Oh, yes, one of my
favorites too.

602
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,133
- I always win.

603
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,900
- Next to Britney,
we have Sasha Fierce,

604
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,934
a.k.a. Beyoncé
is in the house.

605
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,533
Hey, Sasha.

606
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,600
- Hi, how are you?

607
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,734
Beyonce's just like me.

608
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,400
All I have to do is
just be myself,

609
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,867
like, just smile,

610
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,100
say nice things--

611
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,300
thank you for having me.

612
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,367
- Tyra is really lucky that she
has immunity this week.

613
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:00,500
Because her Beyoncé
was not Beyoncé.

614
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,900
It was Tyra talking.

615
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,133
- Here's how the game works.

616
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,800
I'll ask a series of questions,

617
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,934
the celebrities will fill in
the blanks,

618
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,266
and you'll give an answer that
you think will match theirs.

619
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,834
All right, Phoebe,
are you ready to play?

620
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,400
- I'm ready.
- Okay, here we go.

621
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,500
Fat Fanny, the drag queen
is so fat

622
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,233
instead of dollars she prefers
to be tipped with blank.

623
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,900
- Well, I know in the South it
would be pork rinds.

624
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,767
So I would have to say
pork rinds.

625
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,200
- Pork rinds,
that's a good answer.

626
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,934
- She wants to be tipped with
pork rinds.

627
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,066
She's fat, right?

628
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,066
Carol Channing?

629
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,066
- Bingo.

630
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,834
[laughing]

631
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:37,800
Did I win?

632
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,900
- No, you didn't win.

633
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,533
Actually, we may want to see
your answer.

634
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,200
What did you fill in
the blank with?

635
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,867
Well, I said turkey legs.

636
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,367
- Turkey legs!

637
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:47,367
She's close.

638
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,700
Pink, what'd you say?

639
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,400
- Well, you know, like, I went
to Britney's concert,

640
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,066
and it's just, like, you know,
a drag show.

641
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,066
So I--and I tipped her
with slices of lunchmeat.

642
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,800
- Slices of lunchmeat.

643
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,066
Good answer.

644
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,367
- Paris Hilton,
you have pork rinds?

645
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,500
- No, I don't know too many
fat people.

646
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
- Oh, okay,I see.

647
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,066
- So I don't know what they
like to eat or be tipped with,

648
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,967
but I would think that
they would want something

649
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,567
that could fit
in their tight clothing...

650
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:10,567
- Yes, of course.

651
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,533
- And that they could eat.

652
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,166
So I put beef jerky.
- Beef jerky.

653
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,800
- When I was fat...
- Yeah?

654
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,467
- Kevin liked to tip me in
what he liked to call

655
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,433
his man butter.

656
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,600
- Man butter!

657
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,700
- Mm-hmm, it was really good.

658
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,133
- Sasha Fierce, what do you have

659
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,667
for Fat Fanny,
the drag queen?

660
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,200
What'd she like to be
tipped with?

661
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,467
- Well, ru, I never met
Fat Fanny,

662
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,667
but during my worldwide tour
I stopped in Texas,

663
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,367
and I did meet Mystique.

664
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,367
- Uh-huh.

665
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,467
- And she wanted to be tipped

666
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:37,433
with a two-piece and a biscuit.

667
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,100
- Two-piece and a biscuit.

668
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,367
Mystique gone but not forgotten.

669
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,066
[cheers and applause]

670
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,767
Okay, you ready for
the next question, Alec?

671
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,433
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

672
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:50,233
Slutty Sally is so slutty,

673
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:56,066
last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got blank.

674
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,900
- I'm gonna cast a wide net here

675
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,066
and say the last time I
took a ride on her disco stick,

676
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,266
I got an STD.

677
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,900
- What do you think Slutty
Sally gave to people

678
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,100
with her disco stick?

679
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
- Scurvy.
- Scurvy.

680
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,600
Scurvy, yeah.

681
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,567
- I'm the national spokesperson

682
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,266
for Broadway Actresses
Against Scurvy.

683
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:17,533
- [laughing]

684
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:21,233
- We deliver limes and lemons
to all the people around

685
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,266
in the neighborhood.

686
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,266
And raspberries.

687
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,567
- And raspberries.

688
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,200
Is that a deterrent for scurvy,
raspberries?

689
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,166
- Well, they tell me it is.

690
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,567
I don't really know anything

691
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,734
except what they tell me,
you know.

692
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,734
Carol Channing,
hysterically funny.

693
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,300
I love that she was completely
out of it the entire time.

694
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,900
- Let's go to Kimora Lee
and see what she says.

695
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,066
- Scabies.

696
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,600
- Scabies is not sexually
transmitted, is it?

697
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,934
- It can be, I've had it.

698
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:45,066
- [laughing]

699
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,266
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.
- Yes.

700
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,100
- Last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got...

701
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,700
- Money, honey.

702
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,567
- Lady Gaga, I didn't really
feel like

703
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:59,266
there was any
characteristic "Gaga-ish-ness".

704
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:02,734
- Okay, Rupaul--is Rupaul
asleep down there?

705
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:03,767
Is she okay?

706
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,467
Do we--seriously, is she okay--

707
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,800
oh, she's okay.

708
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
- The time has come now for you
to lip-sync for your life!

709
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,967
- [laughing]

710
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,266
- To impersonate somebody
who's standing

711
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:16,433
ten feet from you
takes gigantic balls.

712
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,200
- ♪ I will always love ♪

713
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,100
♪ Shoes! ♪

714
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,433
- She got shoes
from the disco stick.

715
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:25,433
From Whitney to Britney.

716
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,166
Slutty Sally is so slutty,

717
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,700
last time I took a ride on her
disco stick, I got...

718
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,600
- I got lost.
- You got lost?

719
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
- I got lost.

720
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
[laughing]

721
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,967
Am I wrong?

722
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,200
- Britney...

723
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,333
eerily accurate.

724
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,300
Kinda spooky.

725
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,467
- Thank you.
- All right, darling.

726
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:45,967
Dumb deedee is so dumb,

727
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,433
last night she got arrested
for driving without a blank.

728
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,967
- Let's go to Phoebe price
here, Phoebe price?

729
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:55,066
- I would have to say driving
without a car.

730
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,934
- Driving without a car.

731
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:58,333
- I've done that before.

732
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,433
- Where did you go?

733
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,400
- I don't even--
I was just driving around,

734
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,367
and then I realized, like,
I'm walking, y'all.

735
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,367
[laughter]

736
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:06,867
I'm walking.

737
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,567
- When one queen gets laughs,

738
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,367
everybody scrambles to get just
as many laughs,

739
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,967
but I think once
the scrambling began,

740
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,800
they lost the plot of the game.

741
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
- I'm a little embarrassed, Ru.

742
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,367
- Are you embarrassed?

743
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,433
- I'm a little embarrassed,

744
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,567
'cause I just wrote,

745
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,700
"I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts".

746
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,367
[laughing]

747
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,400
- Great minds think alike.

748
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,500
I said car.

749
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,734
- Thank you, girl!

750
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,734
- I broke you in, girl.

751
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:29,734
I broke you in.

752
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,066
- She looked like Pink,

753
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,233
and the clothes and the wig
and the makeup were hooked up,

754
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,934
but the mannerisms
weren't there for me.

755
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:35,934
- Wonderful, okay.

756
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,533
Lady Gaga.

757
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,834
Well, my first answer
was spaceship.

758
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:40,834
- Uh-huh.

759
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,567
- But the one I put down
was car.

760
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,767
- Two points!

761
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:45,800
Paris Hilton.

762
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,433
- Well, because you're so hot,

763
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,133
I knew that we would get this
right so I said car, too.

764
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,133
- Car!

765
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,333
[applause]

766
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,633
Wonderful!

767
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,533
- The voice wasn't even close
to being Paris Hilton.

768
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:58,333
- Britney, Dumb Deedee's so
dumb last night she got arrested

769
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,800
for driving without a...

770
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,433
- A baby in her lap.

771
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:02,533
- A baby...

772
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,834
[laughing]

773
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:06,166
- Because every time I do it,
I don't get arrested.

774
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,367
- Yes, that's right.

775
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,867
- Dumb.

776
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,567
- Before I say my answer,
can I say one thing?

777
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:11,867
- Yes.
- To Britney and Whitney.

778
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:12,867
- Yes.

779
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:13,967
- Because I love them much.

780
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,400
Whitney, you're such an
inspiration to me.

781
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,367
- I love you too, baby girl.

782
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,200
- But I notice
they keep twitching.

783
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,500
And I know that they're
survivors,

784
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,300
but the only way
they're gonna keep survivin'

785
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,233
if they stop sniffin'
these markers next to them.

786
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,633
- Am I the only one
who's doin' it?

787
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,333
- Uh, I--apparently.

788
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,333
- It smells like home.

789
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:33,333
[laughing]

790
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:37,767
- So right now, the score
stands at five for Alec,

791
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,533
three for Phoebe.

792
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:40,700
Alec has won this game.

793
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
- Thanks, stars!

794
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Thank you, ladies.

795
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,667
Thank you.

796
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,066
- All right, until then
we love you,

797
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:50,467
keep coming back
on Snatch Game 2010.

798
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:53,934
All right, stars,
see you next time.

799
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:55,500
- I'll be really surprised
to see

800
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,767
who's in the bottom two
tomorrow.

801
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,367
Yeah, it'll be
a sleepless night.

802
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,066
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

803
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,400
- Good morning,
morning glories.

804
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,867
- It's lip-sync day.
- Here goes.

805
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:13,233
- Who feel like they're gonna
be on the bottom tonight?

806
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,633
- Just as long as it's not me.

807
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,734
- The bottom is not bad.

808
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,367
[laughing]

809
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,066
- I do wish all of you luck.

810
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,734
Can you win a challenge
two weeks in a row?

811
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,667
- Do you think you're gonna win
two weeks in a row?

812
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,333
- I'm praying I do.

813
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,633
- I don't know why Tyra
was asking

814
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,500
if anyone's ever won
two challenges in a row.

815
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,100
Because she's totally
not gonna win.

816
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,734
- What did you guys think
about me?

817
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,700
- Picking Beyoncé's
a difficult thing to pick.

818
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,100
Like, because she's not
that funny.

819
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,667
- But I don't think Britney
is funny,

820
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,066
but you made her funny.

821
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,600
- No, Britney is funny.

822
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,300
- But there are a lot of things
that B does

823
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,767
that are funny to me.

824
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,934
- The only thing she's done
funny is fall.

825
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,433
- Well, that's funny to you
and that's crude.

826
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:54,700
And like, I almost just jumped
out this chair at your ass.

827
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,533
That was insulting to Beyoncé.

828
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,934
This is something that she may
have been embarrassed about.

829
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:00,934
- You gotta get over this whole
Beyoncé thing.

830
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:02,967
- No, just drop it, please
just drop it, girl.

831
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,266
- Beyoncé fell,
and it was funny.

832
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,767
It tickled me pink.

833
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:07,900
- I thought it was funny, too.

834
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,867
- It was funny!

835
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,433
You don't know Beyoncé
personally.

836
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:13,467
- Tyra, she believes
that she's Beyoncé.

837
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,433
And she doesn't wanna hurt
Beyoncé's feelings,

838
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,567
because somehow Beyoncé
pays her bills.

839
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,667
- Well, we'll see
on the main stage.

840
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:23,533
I'm just gonna shut up.

841
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:27,333

850
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,967
Santino, how are you?

851
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,433
- Ru, I'm great, how are you?

852
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:43,600
- Are you jealous of my boogie?

853
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,567
- I am so jealous.

854
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,533
- Today you are just
boogielicious.

855
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,567
- [laughing]

856
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,867
Niecy Nash, thank you for
joining us.

857
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,367
- Thank you for having me.

858
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,800
And thank you for letting me
have that flower!

859
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
[laughing]

860
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,567
- Lisa Rinna.
- Hello.

861
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,567
- You are gorgeous.

862
00:28:58,567 --> 00:28:59,834
- Oh, no, you are.

863
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,266
Stop it. Thank you.

864
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:03,233
- This week, the ladies
were challenged

865
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,200
to a celebrity impersonation.

866
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Tonight, I asked them
to knock us out

867
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,333
with their own
personal style.

868
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,533
Judges, are you ready
for what's coming?

869
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,600
- Ready!
- Oh, yeah.

870
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,133
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.

871
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,967
And may the best woman win.

872
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,567
Pandora Boxx...

873
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,767
- I'm feeling really good
about the choice I made

874
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,066
with the dress.

875
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,834
I'm listening to what
all the judges have said,

876
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,800
and I'm trying to incorporate
that into my runway.

877
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,100
- She's like
a hollywood starlet

878
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,266
looking for a casting couch.

879
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,734
Tyra sanchez,
ladies and gentlemen.

880
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,066
It's the other Tyra.

881
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,266
- What recession?

882
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:42,400
[laughter]

883
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,066
- The concept of my costume,
I was thinking,

884
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,600
for a rich, couture woman,

885
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,133
and she has endless
amounts of money.

886
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,333
- Just buried the husband.

887
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,066
- And out spending his money.

888
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,066
- What do the bags say?

889
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,066
They say "Santino."

890
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,066
[laughter]

891
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,834
Oh, my god.

892
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:02,133
Santino, I didn't know you had
a boutique.

893
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,400
Okay, Morgan McMichaels.

894
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,667
Oh, honey, the circus
is in town.

895
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,567
- My personal style
is funky and fun,

896
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,467
and, you know,
drag is a circus,

897
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,834
and I want to be the director.

898
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,700
- It's the greatest show
on earth, Morgan McMichaels.

899
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,033
Jujubee.

900
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,867
Or should I say Lil' Kim?

901
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,867
- I feel like I'm
a superhero diva,

902
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,367
and my power is glitter.

903
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,967
- Is that Lil' Kim
or Lil' Kimchi?

904
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,734
Yes.
- Wow.

905
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,433
- Oh.

906
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,667
Sonique's in the house,
ladies and gentlemen.

907
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,433
Julie Newmar,
eat your heart out.

908
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:38,000
- My style was dominatrix,
feline, sex kitten.

909
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,800
- Faster pussycat, kill, kill.

910
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,667
Tatianna Porizkova.

911
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,000
- As I'm walking further down
the runway,

912
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,367
I'm noticing that my skirt
is rising and rising

913
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:49,467
and rising.

914
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:50,734
- Honey, if that skirt
were any shorter,

915
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,133
we'd have to arrest you
for dealing crack.

916
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,667
Jessica Wild.

917
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,467
Puerto Rico, okay.

918
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,533
- I feel great.

919
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,767
I feel very good.

920
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,367
I'm very happy with my outfit.

921
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:05,066
- She gonna party like
it's 1999, hunty.

922
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,367
High fashion.

923
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,100
Parisian.

924
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
- Ohh.

925
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,767
- Don't go out and blend in
with the rest of them.

926
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,867
Every time you go out there,
look your best.

927
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,633
Don't save something for later

928
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,066
because you may not have later.

929
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,834
- Ooh, yes, honey.

930
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:20,934
- These ruffles have not
any ridges.

931
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:24,200
- No, I bet you can't take
just one bite.

932
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,066
Ooh, girl!

933
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,567
Sahara Davenport.

934
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,900
What will people say?

935
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,367
- I'm feeling very powerful
and strong.

936
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:35,633
They need to see
this side of me.

937
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:36,934
- Little Grace Jones.

938
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:38,600
- Yes, gorgeous.

939
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,734
Ladies, your fate
is in your hands.

940
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,633
Inside there's either
a heel or no heel.

941
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:50,100
If it's a heel,
you can walk away safe.

942
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,367
No heel, and you stay,

943
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:56,233
which means you're one of
the best or worst of the week.

944
00:31:56,233 --> 00:32:00,734
Tyra Sanchez, heel or no heel?

945
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,600
She's got a heel.

946
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,900
Congratulations, you're safe.

947
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,333
- Thank you.

948
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,066
- You may join Sasha Fierce
backstage with the dancers.

949
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,967
Tatianna.

950
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,233
No heel.

951
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,533
You stay.

952
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,867
Raven.

953
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,533
- Please just let there be
a fucking heel in this briefcase

954
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,266
so I can leave the stage.

955
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,800
- Heel.
- Yes! Thank you, Jesus!

956
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,233
[laughter]

957
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,667
- Jujubee.

958
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,300
No heel.

959
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,734
Jessica Wild.

960
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,066
Heel.

961
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,734
Sahara Davenport.

962
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,300
Heel.

963
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,400
Sonique.

964
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,667
No heel.

965
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,100
Pandora Boxx.

966
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,600
No heel.

967
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
Morgan McMichaels.

968
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,533
No heel.

969
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,100
You stay.

970
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,633
The five of you represent

971
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,066
the top and bottom of the week.

972
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:54,633
It's time for
the judges' critique.

973
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:58,834
Jujubee, the challenge
yesterday, you were Kimora Lee.

974
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,734
- I think I would have liked to
have seen you to be even bigger.

975
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,233
- We don't want to
talk about that.

976
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,700
- You don't want to talk
about that?

977
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
- It's personal.

978
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,934
- When you do characters,

979
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:08,700
and you only have
a short amount of time,

980
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,100
you want to do the biggest thing
about them

981
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,266
that makes people go,
"That's Kimora."

982
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,467
- Thank you, Jujubee.

983
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:18,100
Sonique, yesterday you portrayed
Lady Gaga.

984
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,767
- I think what Lady Gaga
was missing was comedy.

985
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,066
- Trust.

986
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,066
I didn't want to embarrass
my character.

987
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,166
It's all about the fashion.

988
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,400
I focused a lot
on the way I looked.

989
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,633
- I want you to come out
from behind the mask.

990
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,100
I feel like you might be hiding
a little bit.

991
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,633
- Would you like me
to take my mask off?

992
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,633
- Would you, please?

993
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,066
Can we see?

994
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,500
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Sonique.

995
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,567
- There we go, okay.
- Yay!

996
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,500
- There's a lot of fabulousness
in there,

997
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,633
and I think we just need to see
more of it.

998
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:50,066
- All right, Sonique,
thank you.

999
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,066
Pandora Boxx.

1000
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,066
- Hello.

1001
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,467
- I think you give great camp,

1002
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:57,200
because instead of doing camp
that's, like, cheesy,

1003
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,567
you do camp that's funny.

1004
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:01,066
- I just wrote "I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts."

1005
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,533
[laughter]

1006
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,767
- I think you nailed it.

1007
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,734
You so nailed it, girl.

1008
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:08,233
I just think you own it.

1009
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,934
- Thank you.

1010
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:12,066
- Tatianna.

1011
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:14,734
How do you think you did on
the Snatch Game?

1012
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,433
- I felt really proud
of myself.

1013
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:20,867
- Last time I took a ride
on her disco stick, I got...

1014
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,066
- I got lost.

1015
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:24,166
- She used to live around
the corner from us,

1016
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:28,667
and so I saw her a lot,
and you nailed her.

1017
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,300
- I think you've got
a million-dollar face

1018
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,100
and a $5 million body,

1019
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,800
and you've got a $20 outfit on.

1020
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,233
But I want to see more charm
and less hooker.

1021
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,600
- Morgan McMichaels.

1022
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,066
Tell me about your Pink
during snatch game.

1023
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:45,667
Now, I've never seen you
on a game show before.

1024
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,834
Is this your first one?

1025
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,567
- This is my first--
it's not my first one,

1026
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,734
but it's my first
game show.

1027
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:52,333
- Your Pink,
I didn't necessarily get.

1028
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,433
I think you could have been
way more obvious,

1029
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:55,600
way more butch.

1030
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,333
- It wasn't very effervescent.

1031
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,700
- I felt like it went over
like a fart in a space suit.

1032
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,767
And it was a risk.

1033
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,300
And I knew by doing Pink,

1034
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,066
I would be here.

1035
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,433
- Thank you, ladies.

1036
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:09,633
While you wait in the
Interior Illusions lounge,

1037
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:12,100
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1038
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,700
Thank you, ladies.

1039
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,166
This is the time when we have
to break this shit down.

1040
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,767
Sonique, I was not gagging over
her Lady Gaga.

1041
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:21,834
- Yeah.

1042
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,633
- Even if we don't know
who Lady Gaga is.

1043
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:24,800
She could have done anything.

1044
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,100
Make something up.

1045
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,567
- Great on the pole dancing.

1046
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,700
Like, unbelievable.

1047
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,934
- When she hit the pole,

1048
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,400
she was on fire.

1049
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,900
She has to take that
pole performance

1050
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,400
and put it in her
Lady Gaga.

1051
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,166
She has to be more out there.

1052
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,400
Tatianna.

1053
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,066
- She needs to go home
and read 20<i> Vogues</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

1054
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,500
and get back to us.

1055
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,400
- Her Britney was amazing.

1056
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,767
- Oh, the Britney, genius.

1057
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,900
Her Britney blew me away.

1058
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,266
I think it was
the best character

1059
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:49,133
on the Snatch panel.

1060
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,333
- Pandora Boxx.

1061
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,500
- Pandora Boxx has got
great comedic timing.

1062
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,066
I don't love her personal style.

1063
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,433
I mean, it's almost easier
for her

1064
00:35:56,433 --> 00:36:00,834
to play a character than
be herself as Pandora Boxx.

1065
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:02,633
It's not all, like, linking up.

1066
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:04,433
- She's a drag queen
for Christ's sake.

1067
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:07,333
She giving us lightness
and comedy and old movie star,

1068
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,066
and I think she does it
really well.

1069
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,066
- Okay.

1070
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:12,200
Morgan McMichaels.

1071
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,767
Her Pink impersonation was not
very strong.

1072
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:18,100
- She did say that she knew
that she may have that problem

1073
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,867
with not being able to go for it
because of her reverence.

1074
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:22,533
Now, if this is a competition,

1075
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,834
and you're trying to win,

1076
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:24,900
you need to take a risk,

1077
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,333
but that's the wrong risk
to take.

1078
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,400
- Jujubee.

1079
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,967
- She was not in the most
fabulous outfit.

1080
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,066
Merle, I'm surprised you didn't
pick her apart.

1081
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,967
- I would have if it was
on somebody else,

1082
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,066
but something
about her comedy

1083
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,300
and her wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

1084
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,133
- Let's talk about her
performance as Kimora.

1085
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:44,667
- As a comedian, that makeup
on her neck--what?

1086
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,967
- That was a good detail.

1087
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:48,100
- You know, the performance
could have just been okay,

1088
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,600
but that attention to detail--

1089
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
- Yes, and it's those
little things

1090
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,700
that make a character
come to life.

1091
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,567
- It's so true.
- Okay, silence.

1092
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,100
I've made my decision.

1093
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,266
Bring back my girls.

1094
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:05,600
Welcome back, ladies.

1095
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,767
I've made some decisions.

1096
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:12,967
Pandora Boxx, you delivered
another standout performance,

1097
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,567
but you were overshadowed
by one of your competitors.

1098
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,600
You're safe.

1099
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,400
You may join the other girls.

1100
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,900
Tatianna, you may have looked
a little cheap on the runway,

1101
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,166
but in the challenge

1102
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,834
you displayed a level of
confidence and professionalism

1103
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:35,233
that is worthy of the next
drag superstar.

1104
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,200
Congratulations, you're
the winner of this challenge.

1105

[applause]

1106
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,900
- Thank you.

1107
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,567
Thank you so much.

1108
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,700
- You've won immunity
for next week,

1109
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,467
plus a $1,000 shopping spree

1110
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,800
from billiondollarbabes.com.

1111
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,300
- It's just validating.

1112
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,700
I really am meant to be here,

1113
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
and there really is something
special in me.

1114
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,533
- Congratulations, Tatianna.

1115
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,533
You earned this one.

1116
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:00,767
- Thank you so much.

1117
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,967
[sniffling]

1118
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,500
- Sonique,
you're a beautiful doll,

1119
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,934
but we were not gagging
on the eleganza of your Gaga.

1120
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:14,367
It was a risky choice and one
that did not pay off.

1121
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,233
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.

1122
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:20,900
- Being in the bottom was just
so fucking nerve-racking.

1123
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,767
- Morgan McMichaels,
you were pretty in pink.

1124
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:24,934
- Thank you.

1125
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:28,834
- But your performance left us
a little blue.

1126
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,800
You're up for elimination.

1127
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,867
- First time in the bottom two
sucks.

1128
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,133
I knew I was going to be there,

1129
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,567
and I knew I deserved
to be there.

1130
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,233
- Jujubee, I've saved you
for last,

1131
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,834
because I want to light
a fire under you.

1132
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:45,266
You keep landing in the middle
of the pack.

1133
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:49,433
Turn up the heat,
or you could go down in flames.

1134
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,500
- I won't.

1135
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
- You are safe.

1136
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,967
Please join the other girls.

1137
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,333
Two queens stand before me.

1138
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,066
I've consulted with the judges,

1139
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:06,400
but the final decision is mine
to make.

1140
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,567
This is your last chance
to impress me

1141
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:14,667
and save yourselves
from elimination.

1142
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:21,467
The time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.

1143
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:24,333
And remember, good luck

1144
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,333
and don't fuck it up.

1178
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,900
you both approached this with

1179
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,734
two completely different styles.

1180
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:42,734
Morgan, the precision of your
lip-sync

1181
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,467
was one of the tightest
we've ever seen.

1182
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,967
Sonique, you pulled out
all the stops

1183
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:52,400
and worked every inch
of this stage.

1184
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,767
This choice has never been
so difficult.

1185
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:01,100
But I've made my decision.

1186
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,834
Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes?

1187
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,700
- Shante, you stay.

- I guess the hardest part of
this whole contest

1192
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:25,600
was trying to find
the beauty in yourself.

1193
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,734
Maybe I shoulda just stopped
being so serious.

1194
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,734
There's more to life than just
being better than everyone,

1195
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:35,066
and I definitely feel
more humble now.

1196
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:36,834
- Ladies, you're all-stars,

1197
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:39,066
but only one of you can be

1198
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:41,633
the next drag superstar.

1199
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:44,934
Remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1200
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,500
how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?

1201
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,867
Can I get an amen in here?

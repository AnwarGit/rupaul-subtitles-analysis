"THIS WOULD MAKE
SUCH AN AMAZING CORSET."

554
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,500

GONNA REALLY TAILOR THESE

564
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
INTO A HIGH-WAISTED PANT
JUST TO MAKE IT HIGH-FASHION,

565
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,400
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE A PANT CAN BE
HARD TO TRANSLATE

566
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,233

698
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,800
I'VE GOT MY MAKEUP DID.

699
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,900
I'VE GOT MY 28-INCH WAIST.

700
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,967
OKAY? I AM WORKING IT
LIKE A NINETIES RUNWAY MODEL.

701
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,000
- THERE'S SOME
KRISTEN WIIG-Y IN THERE.

702
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
- SHE GETTING WIIG-Y WITH IT?

703
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,467
- [LAUGHING]

704
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:11,333
- ADORE DELANO,

705
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,767
- HONEY CHILD.

706
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:15,500
- I'D BET $100,000
WOULD MAKE HER HOLLER.

707
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,633
- [LAUGHS]

708
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:18,867
- I'M SCARED.

709
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,600
I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING MESS,

710
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,333
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME,

711
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,467
SO I NEED TO SELL THIS GARMENT

712
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:28,867
LIKE IT'S
A 2004 HEATHERETTE SHOW.

713
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:30,400
- SHH, IT'S A WIG.

714
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,633
[LAUGHTER]

715
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:36,266

[LAUGHTER]

721
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,233

00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,967
AND I AM SERVING IT DOWN,
MISS THING.

723

00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:13,567
- BENDELACREME VISAGE.

732
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,667
- I'M GIVING BENDELACREME

00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,300
I'M GIVING THEM THE SEX APPEAL,

735
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,467
AND THE GOOFINESS.

736
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,066
- CHEESECAKE.
- MMM, EAT IT.

737
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,033

738
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,033

00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,233
- I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.

740
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,266
- YOU'RE TRIPPING.

741
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,533
- THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.

742
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:33,500
- HIDEOUS.

743
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,967
- [LAUGHING]

744
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,567
[LAUGHING]

745
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,734
WELCOME, LADIES.

746
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:42,967
IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.

747
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,100
FIRST UP, G-G-GIA GUNN.

748
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,266
- I THINK YOUR LOOK IS
WELL-ASSEMBLED.

749
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,700
YOUR HAIR IS FLAWLESS.

750
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,734
- I COULD TELL
THAT YOU'RE THE FEISTY ONE.

751
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:53,500
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ONE THING I WANT YOU

752
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,300
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF: A BOOTY
WITH AN OPEN LEG CUTS YOUR LEG.

753
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,633
- ABSOLUTELY.

754
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,900
- I LIKE THE BOOTY.

755
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,266
- THANK YOU, GIA.
- ABSOLUTELY.

756
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:06,734
- APRIL CARRION, I'M
VERY EXCITED THAT YOU CHANGED

757
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:09,233
YOUR MIND
ABOUT THAT PAIR OF PANTS.

758
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,333
- THE PANTS WEREN'T FITTING,

759
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,967
AND I LOOKED
LIKE A CRAZY MAN, REALLY.

760
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:13,934
- [LAUGHS]

761
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,767
- YOU DID A REALLY
AMAZING JOB AT TAKING

762
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:19,567
HYPER-MASCULINE ELEMENTS
AND MAKING A FEMININE LOOK.

763
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,734
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

764
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:21,967
- WELL, YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.

765
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:22,934
- OH, THANK YOU.

766
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:25,467
- GET A ROOM.
[LAUGHTER]

767
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,800
- UP NEXT, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

768
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,900
- HEY, GIRL.

769
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,600
- LAGANJA, YOU'RE
TRIPPING ON THE SKIRT.

770
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,667
- OKAY.
- ALSO LOST YOUR NECKLINE

771
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,000
COMPLETELY.
- RIGHT.

772
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,300
- I'M KIND OF LOVING HOW
YOUR HAIR BLENDS INTO THE TOP.

773
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,700
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.

774
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
- ABSOLUTELY.

775
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,500
- BUT I NEED MORE FISH
FROM YOU ONSTAGE.

776
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,633
I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.

777
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,967
- [OBNOXIOUSLY] OKAY.

778
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,767
- YOU ARE FILLED
WITH ENERGY, ARE YOU?

779
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:51,333
- YES, GO ON.

780
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,600
- THANK YOU, LAGANJA.

781
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,433
ALL RIGHT, KELLY MANTLE.

782
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,066
- IS THAT BACON ON YOUR CHEST?

783
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,333
- [LAUGHS]

784
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,400
- WHAT IS IT?

785
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
- THEY'RE FLOWER PETALS.

786
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,033
- I'M STILL GETTING BACON.

787
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:07,333
- I THINK I WAS FOCUSING MORE
ON THE HIGH-FASHION PART OF IT.

788
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,100
- BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS HIGH
FASHION LIKE WHITE POLYESTER.

789
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,700
THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.

790
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,166
- HORRIBLE?
- HORRIBLE.

791
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,433
- SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT THE MATERIALS,

792
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:18,900
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY FEMININE,
AND I LIKE THAT.

793
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,734
- ADORE DELANO,
TELL ME ABOUT THIS OUTFIT.

794
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:25,100
- WELL, UM...

795
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,233
I HAD A VISION.

796
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,500
LIKE, IF I WAS
AN EIGHTIES MERMAID

797
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,800
WHO GOT HER PROM DONE BY,

798
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,800
LIKE, HEATHERETTE
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED,

799
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,233
DIDN'T HAVE A SEWING MACHINE.

800
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,533
- [LAUGHING]

801
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,834
- JUST LEARNING HOW TO MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF SOMETHING.

802
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,433
[LAUGHTER]

803
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,233
- I THINK YOU
ARE SO FREAKING CUTE.

804
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,700
- OH, THANK YOU.
- BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH FABRIC

805
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,266
WRAPPED AROUND YOUR BODY
WITH A BELT.

806
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,033
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS OUTFIT.

807
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,800
THE EXECUTION OF THE WHOLE THING
IS NOT THERE.

808
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT ONE LAST LOOK IN THE MIRROR

809
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,667
BEFORE YOU HIT THE RUNWAY.

810
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,533
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.

811
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:04,033
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
A NEW YORKER WALKS THE RUNWAY,

812
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,900
BECAUSE WE HAVE
THAT KIND OF BALL WALK,

813
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,233
THAT PEPPER LABEIJA KIND OF...
- OKAY.

814
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,934
- YES, HONEY.
- I DON'T KNOW.

815
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:12,066
IT'S LIKE THIS WEIRD
COMBINATION OF CAROL CHANNING

816
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,700
MEETS EDGAR ALLAN POE.
[LAUGHTER]

817
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,333
- OH, OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT

818
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,200
TO COMBINE THOSE TWO.
YOU JUST DON'T.

819
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,567
- THE WORST PART
OF YOUR LOOK IS THE HEMLINE.

820
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,467
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU RAN OUT OF FABRIC.

821
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,333
- NEXT UP, BENDELACREME.

822
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,433
- DID YOU SEW THIS?
- I DIDN'T.

823
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,667
THIS IS ALL JUST
HOT GLUE AND DESPERATION

824
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,000
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

825
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,800
I WANTED THE CRAFTSMANSHIP TO GO
WITH THE GOLDEN GIRLS THEME

826
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,867
AND LOOK LIKE IT WAS MADE
BY OLD ARTHRITIC HANDS.

827
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,600
[LAUGHTER]

828
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,633
- IT'S COUTURE.

829
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,033
IT'S A CONCEPT.

830
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,066
IT'S STUNNING.

831
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,467
- ALL RIGHT, DELA,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

832
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:46,567
NOW, WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORM DECOR LOUNGE,

833
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,900
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.

834
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,967
JUST BETWEEN US--
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS--

835
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

836
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,667
LET'S START WITH GIA GUNN.

837
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,900
- I WASN'T THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED

838
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,033
BY THE ENSEMBLE
SHE PUT TOGETHER.

839
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:00,333
- I'M NOT TRYING TO BE SHADY,

840
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,467
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HER
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING.

841
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:04,700
- YOU KNOW, HER ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING WAS,

842
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,333
"OH, ABSOLUTELY," YOU KNOW,
BEFORE WE EVEN FINISHED

843
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,567
THE COMMENT.
- BUT SHE WAS ABLE

844
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,900
TO WORK THE GARMENT.

845
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,500
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT APRIL CARRION.

846
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,467
- I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

847
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,734
THE FACE, THE BODY,
AND ALSO THE OUTFIT

848
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,433
I THOUGHT WAS REALLY
HIGH-FASHION.

849
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,133
- SHE HAMMERED THIS CHALLENGE.

850
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:22,233
- FOR ME, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A FAN WHEN DRAG QUEENS

851
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,300
USE THEIR OWN HAIR, AND,
IF THEY DO USE THEIR OWN HAIR,

852
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,433
IT CAN'T HAVE
A MAN'S BUZZ CUT BACK THERE.

853
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,100
- I KIND OF THOUGHT
IT WAS KIND OF HOT.

854
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,300
- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FUCK HER.

855
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,567
- [LAUGHING]

856
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:36,433
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

857
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,233
- THE THING AROUND HER HEAD
AND THEN THIS ELIZABETHAN COLLAR

858
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,700
AND THEN THAT SCHMATTA...

859
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,600
ON THE BOTTOM, IT WAS JUST...

860
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,867
[IMITATES DEJECTED TONE]

861
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:46,567
- I LIKED THAT IT WAS ODD.

862
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,200
THERE WERE CERTAIN PROPORTIONS
SHE WAS MAKING WITH HER HAIR

863
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,834
GOING INTO THAT COLLAR.

864
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,600
- BUT I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TOO HARD.

865
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
WITH HER PERSONALITY,
"UH-HUH, MAMA,"

866
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,300
YOU KNOW, AND, LIKE,

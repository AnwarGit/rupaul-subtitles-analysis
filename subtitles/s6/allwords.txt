- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE..."
I AM LAUNCHING MY FIRST-EVER
MAKEUP LINE,
AND I NEED YOU TO MARKET IT.
YOU'LL BE WORKING IN PAIRS.
- WE'RE TOO BUSY PAINTING
OUR OWN FACES INSTEAD OF THEIRS.
- A SICKENING SWEEP OF BLUSH
HELPS DISTRACT FROM
UNSIGHTLY SCARS.
- BENDELA, WE'RE HIDING
BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.
LAGANJA, THE CROTCH
IS A LITTLE LOW.
YOUR HAIR IS UNEVEN.
IT'S FLOPPING.
- WE'VE GOT, LIKE,
A LITTLE SISTER VIBE GOING.
SHE'S THE LITTLE SISTER.
- I'M THE LOW-RENT VERSION
OF COURTNEY.
- I MAY HAVE USED
THAT TERM ONCE.
- ADORE AND LAGANJA, YOU'RE THE
WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
DARIENNE LAKE, SHANTE, YOU STAY.
BENDELACREME, YOUR TIME HERE
IS NOT OVER.
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- YEAH.
- WHOO-OO!
- OH, WHEW.
- WELL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO HOME.
- ME, TOO.
I HAVE NO WORDS.
I'M SO SCARED THAT I CAME
THAT CLOSE TO LEAVING SO SOON.
[SIGHS]
WELL, I THANK EVERYONE
WHO GASPED IN THE BACKGROUND
WHEN I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
I WAS STAYING.
APPRECIATED THAT.
- I WAS GONNA CAUSE A RIOT
IF SHE SENT YOU HOME.
I WAS LIKE, "NO,
YOU'VE MADE THE WRONG DECISION."
[RECORD SCRATCHES]
- ARE YOU NOT GONNA CONGRATULATE
ADORE AND I?
DO YOU THINK THAT WE DIDN'T
DESERVE TO WIN AS A TEAM?
- I DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE WON.
- I'M SURE MANY
OF MY COMPETITORS
FELT THAT ADORE CARRIED ME
FOR THIS WIN,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
SHE'S STANDING
IN AN '80s SWEATER
AND A SKIRT FROM FOREVER 21,
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
ON MY LOOK.
- PARTY.
- JOSLYN, I MEAN,
YOU'RE BEING VERY QUIET.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- TONIGHT IN THE SILVER LOUNGE,
COURTNEY READ MY LOOK.
- I JUST THINK THAT YOUR DRAG
ISN'T AS POLISHED
AS THE OTHER DRAG
IN THE COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.
- DO YOU GUYS REALLY FEEL LIKE
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE?
- NO, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
- I THINK YOU DESERVE
TO BE HERE.
- I DO FEEL THAT
THE LOOK TONIGHT
WASN'T EXECUTED AS WELL
AS THE VISION IN YOUR HEAD,
BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING,
I GOT A WHOLE BOX FULL OF SHIT.
- I'VE GOT A WHOLE RACK
OF THINGS.
- I'VE BEEN DOING DRAG
FOR 13 YEARS,
AND I'M NOT BEING MEAN;
I'M JUST BEING FACTUAL.
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN IT IN ANY WAY
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I WAS SAYING
THAT YOU WEREN'T DESERVING
OF BEING IN THE COMPETITION.
- I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE
SUCH A BIG RESPECT FOR YOU,
IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT MYSELF.
LIKE, I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND,
LIKE, THAT HURT ME REALLY BAD.
NOTHING ELSE HAS HURT ME SINCE
I'VE BEEN IN THIS COMPETITION
THAN WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT I LOOKED UNPOLISHED.
- IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
OR ANYTHING,
I'M JUST TRYING TO OFFER A HAND
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
DO EVEN BETTER.
- NO, AND I APPRECIATE YOU
OFFERING ME HELP, BUT I JUST--
I CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE IT
AS PATRONIZING ALMOST.
- WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS IT IS
A LITTLE BIT.
- AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW IF
I LOOK UP TO COURTNEY AS MUCH.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
MAKING FRIENDS.
NOW IT'S GAME ON.

- THANK YOU, RU.
- NOW, LADIES,
FOR TODAY'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW,
HASH TAG DRAGQUEENSOFCOMEDY.
EACH OF YOU NEEDS TO WRITE
AND PERFORM A STAND-UP COMEDY.
- HURRICANE BIANCA'S IN TOWN.
NO ONE IS SAFE.
- NOW, JOSLYN, SINCE YOU
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
YOU GET TO PICK THE ORDER
OF THE LINEUP.
NOW, I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR
CHARISMA, UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT TO TICKLE
MY FUNNY BONE.
- IT'S RIGHT HERE
WHERE MY RIB USED TO BE.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS, LADIES.
- ALL RIGHT,
"COURTNEY IS AN ASSHOLE."
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S A GUARANTEED LAUGH.
- HA HA!
- ARE THERE TWO R's
IN YOUR NAME?
- WHY, ARE YOU MAKING JOKES
ABOUT ME?
- NO, I'M JUST MAKING A LIST
OF ALL THE GIRLS
SO I CAN THINK ABOUT THE ORDER
I'M-A PUT YOU ALL IN.
- SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO, JOSLYN.
YOU PUT BIANCA ON FIRST,
AND THEN WHOEVER YOU WANT
TO THROW UNDER THE BUS
YOU PUT SECOND.
- HA HA!
- THEN YOU PUT ME SECOND LAST
AND YOU LAST.
- THAT'S JUST SHADY.
YESTERDAY YOU WERE SUGGESTING
THAT HER DRAG WAS UGLY.
TODAY YOU'RE TELLING HER
HOW TO DO A LINEUP.
- YEAH, ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
- YOU ARE A SHADY CUNT.
- LOVE YOU, JOSLYN.
- [MOUTHING WORDS]
- DELA'S REALLY FREAKING ME OUT
RIGHT NOW.
THIS BITCH IS
TALKING TO HERSELF.
I WAS LIKE, "BITCH, I THOUGHT I
WAS THE CRAZY ONE UP IN HERE."
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE, BENDELA?
- UM, I THINK THAT
I'M GONNA GO WITH
SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF MORE
A BLANKET PERSONAL NARRATIVE.
- HA HA!
KNEE-SLAPPER.
- COMING UP...
- I GET TO DECIDE THE ORDER
THE GIRLS PERFORM IN.
FIRST UP, OPENING THE SHOW...
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
- TODAY WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
OUR STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINE
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.
THIS IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE HARDEST CHALLENGES
OF THE COMPETITION SO FAR.
- ADORE, ARE YOU
GONNA WRITE MATERIAL,
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
WRITE A CARD FOR GUIDELINES
SAYING "COOL, AWESOME, CHOLA,
MY MOM, LIBRA?"
- "PARTY."
- "PARTY." HA HA!
- FUCK OFF.
FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF.
SHIT.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JOS?
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?
- WHEN I WAIT TABLES,
LIKE, THAT'S, LIKE,
MY OPPORTUNITY TO BE
A STAND-UP COMEDIAN,
SO I'M ALWAYS CRACKING JOKES.
IF SOMEBODY ORDERS
A JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL,
I'LL SAY, "I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC."
AND THEY'LL SAY, "TO WHAT?"
AND I'LL SAY, "TO AN OXYMORON."
JUMBO SHRIMP.
- PREGNANT PAUSE.
PREGNANT PAUSE.
- HA HA!
- I KNOW THAT STAND-UP COMEDY
IS NOT MY CUP OF SOUP--
CUP OF TEA--CUP OF--
BOWL OF WHAT?
CUP OF TEA.
THIS IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.
HA HA!
- WHERE DID--
WHERE DID LAGANJA GO?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- LAGANJA, ARE YOU HERE?
OH, OH, WELL.
- YES, GIRL. OK.
- I LOVE IT.
SHE'S UNDER THE TABLE.
- HOW Y'ALL DOING?
- OH, LET ME GET MORE ATTENTION
LIKE THE BIG "NO-SMOKING"
SIGN ON MY HEAD.
LET ME GET UNDER A TABLE.
REALLY, QUEEN?
- MY NAME IS
MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
MISS MARY JANE,
LITTLE MISS 4/20,
OR FOR MY LATIN FOLK
IN THE AUDIENCE, LA MARIJUANA.
- I THINK IN THIS COMPETITION
YOU HAVE TO STAND OUT
AND BE A BOLD CHARACTER.
THIS IS THE PERFECT CHALLENGE
TO SHOWCASE LAGANJA.
HONEY, I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
STONER REALNESS.
NOW, GIRL, IF IT AIN'T GREEN,
WELL, GIRL, I'M NOT INTERESTED.
- I NEED A TRANSITION.
- THE JUDGES SAY THAT
I'M HIDING BEHIND A CHARACTER,
BUT I THINK LAGANJA
IS MAYBE THE PERSON
WHO'S ACTUALLY AFRAID
TO BE EXPOSED RIGHT NOW.
- HOW YOU DOING, DELA?
- OH, I'M PLUGGING AWAY.
HOW ARE YOU?
- GIRL, I'M JUST TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE IN A TENT
AND JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY
CHANNEL THAT INNER CHILD.
- OK.
- THIS PERSON IS NOT THE LAGANJA
THAT I KNOW,
AND IT'S FREAKING ME
THE HELL OUT.
- OK?
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HI.
- HOW ARE MY DRAG QUEENS
OF COMEDY?
- HILARIOUS.
- YUCK-A, YUCK-A, YUCK.
HA HA!
HEY, DELA.
- HI, RU.
- NOW, LAST WEEK
YOU WERE IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
- YES, I WAS.
- DO YOU FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BOUNCE BACK FROM ALL THAT?
- I DEFINITELY DO, YEAH.
I WAS REALLY DEVASTATED
TO BE DOWN THERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU
THE MOST NERVOUS ABOUT?
- I, YOU KNOW, DON'T HAVE
ZINGY ONE-LINERS.
I CONSIDER MY HUMOR
TO BE VERY CHARACTER-BASED.
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
THE NOTE FROM MICHELLE
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
BECAUSE YOU DO A CHARACTER.
- YEAH.
- BUT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL
THAT THAT WASN'T COMING THROUGH.
- BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS IS
THE PERFECT CHALLENGE FOR ME
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO THAT.
- WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HELLO, MISS BIANCA.
- HI.
- EVERYONE'S LOOKING TO YOU
TO BE THE STANDOUT
IN THIS CHALLENGE.
DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?
- CONCERNED, YEAH.
- BUT YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
- BUT FOR ME,
IT'S MORE OBSERVATIONS
AND IN THE MOMENT,
AND I DON'T DO WELL
WITH SITTING DOWN
AND WRITING, "HERE IS A JOKE."
- NOW, IN THE PAST, YOU'VE
ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT OF QUEENS
IN THIS COMPETITION.
- YEAH.
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?
- WELL, THEY'RE ALL
HELPING ME OUT
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.
- HA HA!
- AND I'M NOT JUST
A NASTY CUNT.
I WILL HELP THEM PACK
TO GO HOME.
- HA HA!
- I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN
GOT TO FOLD
SOME OF THE SHIT
THEY'RE WEARING.
YOU JUST BALL IT UP.
"PUT THAT IN BAG NUMBER 5,
BITCH.
GET TO STEPPING."
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU OUT THERE.
- THANK YOU.
THIS CHALLENGE IS REALLY A SHIT
OR GET OFF THE POT MOMENT,
SO LET'S HOPE I CAN DELIVER
A NICE, BIG TURD.
- TRINITY K. BONET,
HEY, MAMA.
- HI.
- HAVE YOU EVER DONE STAND-UP
BEFORE?
- NO.
- DO YOU KNOW ANY JOKES?
- UM...
I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT NOW,
BUT WHEN I FEEL LIKE, LIKE
I HAVE A MAGNIFYING GLASS
OVER ME OR SOMETHING,
THAT'S WHEN IT GETS HARD.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE,
YOUR COMEDY CAME OUT,
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT
ALMOST BY HABIT YOU SHUT DOWN.
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST ALMOST SOMETHING
I CAN'T CONTROL.
YOU JUST--
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.
- I KNOW THAT
THERE'S A BLOCK THERE,
AND SO THAT'S FOR YOU TO UNLOCK.
DON'T LET THE MOMENT
PASS YOU BY.
ALL RIGHT, TRINITY,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
- RU IS COUNTING ON ME TO
DELIVER SOMETHING THAT HE
KNOW DAMN WELL I CAN'T DO.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER ROUND.
TO PROVE THAT YOUR COMEDY
HAS A BROAD APPEAL,
I'VE INVITED A SENIOR CITIZENS
GROUP TO JOIN US.
YES, THEY WILL BE SITTING
FRONT AND CENTER.
- I TOLD YOU IT WAS GONNA BE
AN OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW.
MAKE 'EM LAUGH.
- ANYONE CLOSE TO ME KNOWS
THAT CUNT, BITCH, FUCK,
DAMN, SHIT AND ASS
ARE MY FAVORITE WORDS TO USE.
HA HA! I'M FUCKED.
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES...
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- SO IS ANYONE CURIOUS AS TO
THE ORDER I'VE PUT US ALL IN?
- OOH, YES.
- OH, GOD.
- BECAUSE I WON
THE MINI CHALLENGE TODAY,
I GET TO DECIDE THE ORDER
THAT THE GIRLS PERFORM IN
FOR THE COMEDY SHOW.
OK, NOW, FIRST UP,
WE WILL BE OPENING THE SHOW
WITH NONE OTHER THAN
THE INCOMPARABLE DARIENNE LAKE.
- YAY!
- YAY!
- FOLLOWING DARIENNE
IS COURTNEY ACT.
- JOSLYN IS
A SHADY LITTLE CHARACTER.
HA HA!
SHE'S DUMB LIKE A FOX,
BUT BECAUSE
I'M FOLLOWING DARIENNE,
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M VERY FUNNY.
- AND COURTNEY WILL BE
INTRODUCING OUR THIRD PERFORMER,
ADORE.
- YES.
- FOLLOWING ADORE
WILL BE MISS BENDELACREME.
- ALL RIGHT.
- AND THEN IN OUR FIFTH SLOT,
IT'S LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- OOH.
- AFTER LAGANJA WILL BE
MISS TRINITY K. BONET.
- FOLLOWING TRINITY WILL BE THE
FUNNIEST GIRL OF THE WHOLE BIT,
MS. JOSLYN FO--
OH, THAT'S ME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND THEN CLOSING THE SHOW
WILL BE THE OLDEST
OF ALL THE QUEENS,
MISS BIANCA DEL RIO.
- LET'S HOPE I CAN STAY AWAKE
TILL I GO ON.
- COMING UP...
- I KNOW WE GOT SOME OLD PEOPLE
HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
YEAH, DID YOU GUYS
ALL COME TOGETHER ON THE ARK?
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
- I AM SPARKLE TOSS.
- IT'S COMEDY.
- TODAY WE HAVE TO DO
A STAND-UP ROUTINE
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE, LET ALONE
IN FRONT OF THE ELDERLY.
FOR ME, THIS IS THE TOUGHEST
CHALLENGE THUS FAR.
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH.
- SO JOSY JO-STICKS,
DO YOU HAVE ANY OLD PEOPLE
THAT YOU RELATE TO?
- I'M VERY CLOSE
WITH MY GRANDPARENTS,
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME.
- OH, THAT'S COOL.
- AND MY GRANDFATHER WAS,
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS MY BIGGEST FAN.
- AW.
- AND I REMEMBER, HE HAD READ
ABOUT A BROADWAY STAR.
SHE WAS UP FOR HER FIRST TONY.
THEN SHE OVERHEARD SOME
OF THE OTHER NOMINEES SAYING
HOW BIG OF A JOKE SHE WAS
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO BE NOMINATED
AND THERE'S NO WAY
SHE WAS GOING TO WIN.
AND SHE SAID SHE GOT
REALLY DOWN ON HERSELF
AND WENT BACK OUT THERE
COMPLETELY FEELING DEFEATED,
AND THEN SHE WON THE TONY.
I REMEMBER HIM BRINGING ME
THAT ARTICLE AND SAYING,
"YOU CAN BE THAT SAME PERSON.
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES."
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE MY F.U.
TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT
I COULDN'T SUCCEED IN IT.
AND I JUST--I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY,
'CAUSE I KNOW HE'LL BE PROUDER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
- BIANCA, YOU HAVE
ANY WORRIES AT ALL?
- I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW,
YOU KNOW.
- WHAT'S YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
OF GOING OUT THERE?
- MY WORST NIGHTMARE IS SITTING
NEXT TO YOU LIKE WE ARE NOW.
- [GASPS]
- [LAUGHTER]
- YOU'RE, LIKE, EVIL NICE.
LIKE, WHAT'S WITH THAT?
LIKE, YOU CAN'T HATE YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE HELPFUL
AND YOU'RE SWEET,
BUT YOU'RE TRUTHFUL,
BUT YOU'RE A DICK.
- NOW, IF YOU'D SAID THIS
ON DAY ONE,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR FRIEND.
IT'S AMAZING WE GET THIS CLOSE,
AND YOU'RE LEAVING TODAY.
- WHAT?
- HA HA!
- I FUCKIN' HATE YOU.
- HA HA!

- [LAUGHTER]
- OF COURSE, MY 14 CATS
AND MY APPEARANCE

MIGHT ALSO LET THEM KNOW
I'M SINGLE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I ASKED MY MOTHER,
I'M LIKE, "MOM, HOW DID
I END UP SO TWISTED?
LIKE, DID YOU, LIKE, DROP ME
ON MY HEAD WHEN I WAS A BABY?"
SHE WAS LIKE, "HONEY, YOU HAVE
TO BE HELD TO BE DROPPED."
- [LAUGHTER]
- I AM HERE REPRESENTING
ALL THE BIG AND CURVY GIRLS.
- HEY.
- I'M TRYING TO GET IN SHAPE.
I MEAN--WELL, ROUND

- HI. YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHY I LOOK LIKE A MEXICAN KATY
PERRY RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?
MY MOTHER IS A CHOLA.
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT A CHOLA IS?
CAN I GET A SHOW OF HANDS?
YEAH, WE'RE IN L.A.,
MOTHERFUCKER.
YEAH. MY MOM'S A CHOLA,
AND SHE LIKES BIG COCK.
OK, NO, YEAH.
I WAS REALLY SCARED WHEN I HEARD
THAT SENIOR CITIZENS
WERE GONNA BE IN THE FUCKING
AUDIENCE TONIGHT, OK?
JUST BLAME MY FUCKING GRANDMA
BECAUSE SHE LIKES TO GO TO T.J.
AND GET WORK DONE,
SO I NEVER GRASPED THE CONCEPT
TO RESPECT MY ELDERS.
THE BITCH NEVER AGES.
SHE HAS A FAKE ASS
AND A FAKE HIP,
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE ASS
CAME FIRST AND BROKE THE HIP,
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
SHE'S DOING.
BUT ANYWAYS,
MY GRANDMA'S A WHORE.
NO? COOL.
IT'S MY FIRST TIME, PEOPLE.
HA HA! YOU GUYS HAVING FUN?
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- I'LL MOW YOUR LAWNS LATER.
- MY NAME IS BENDELACREME.
HOLD FOR APPLAUSE.
'KAY.
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE
WITH A LIVE AUDIENCE.
I LOVE IT WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE
JUST RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN JUST
REACH RIGHT OUT AND TOUCH YOU
IF I WANTED TO.
I DON'T WANT TO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
BUT I FEEL LIKE I COULD
IF I WANTED TO,
WHICH IS A GREAT OPTION TO HAVE.
I'M FAR AWAY FROM MY HOME TOWN
OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.
IT'S THE CITY THAT NEVER DRIES,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
RAIN IS NOT SO BAD.
IT IS A MOIST AREA,
BUT IT'S MY MOIST AREA.
AND I LOVE IT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME THERE.
YOU JUST NEED TO WEAR
THE RIGHT PROTECTION, YOU KNOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF STEREOTYPES
ABOUT SEATTLE-ITES,
BUT THEY'RE REALLY JUST REGULAR
FOLK, EXTREMELY REGULAR FOLK.
YOU KNOW, CAFFEINE--
ALL IN LINE FOR THE RESTROOM.
WE LOVE A GOOD REST,
BUT, UM--I DIGRESS.
THE POINT IS I FEEL LIKE
I'VE LEARNED TO SORT
OF WEAVE A STORY,
BRING SOMEBODY ON AN ARC
THAT REALLY ENDS SOMEWHERE
WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE
THING'S BEEN MEANINGFUL,
AND THEY'RE GONNA WIND UP
WITH SOMETHING THAT MADE
THE WHOLE THING WORTHWHILE.
- SO TELL US A JOKE.
- UM, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
- [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
- WOW.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
PUT YOUR LIGHTERS UP.
GANJA'S IN THE HOUSE.
YEAH.
AS YOU COULD TELL
FROM MY ACCENT,
I AM FROM DALLAS, TEX-ASS,
AND IT WAS NOT VERY EASY
GROWING UP LOOKING LIKE THIS,
WHETHER I WAS PLAYING
IN MY GRANDMA'S CLOTHES
OR PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR MY WELL-ORGANIZED,
ALPHABETICALLY-ORDERED
BEANIE BABIES.
I WAS GA-GA-GA-GAY, OK?
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES
THAT I DISCOVERED MARIJUANA.
I MEAN, I LIKE TO SMOKE.
Y'ALL, I AM JUST FLYING AS HIGH
AS YOUR RECEDING HAIRLINE, OK?
MARIJUANA REALLY DOES
HELP ME CALM DOWN.
SO, Y'ALL, I WENT TO VALENCIA
WHERE THEY FILM THE
TV SHOW "WEEDS."
NOW, Y'ALL, IT'S VERY DRY.
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF LIKE
YOUR VAGINA.
CAN I GET A AMEN?
NOW, Y'ALL, I AM A TREE HUGGER
BECAUSE IF IT AIN'T GREEN,
HA, I'M NOT INTERESTED, OK?
- [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
- GET UP AND SHOW ME SOME LOVE.
COME ON, GET UP.
SHOW ME SOME LOVE.
GET UP.
I GOT ON ALL THIS SHIT,
ALL THIS DRAG.
THIS STUFF IS HOT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THIS AIN'T EASY.
I'M NOT A COMEDIAN.
SO, GO ON, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN. SHIT. SHIT.
SIT DOWN.
SO IF YOU ALL HAVE NOT
ALREADY NOTICED,
I AM BLACK, BUT DON'T BE
WORRIED, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON TO
YOUR PURSES AND YOUR WALLETS.
I ALREADY GOT 'EM.
- [LAUGHTER]
- GROWING UP FOR ME
WAS REALLY HARD
BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY POOR.
WE WERE, LIKE,
"GOOD TIMES" POOR.
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY BAD.
AND THE ONLY WAY WE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT
WAS, MY MOTHER WOULD READ US
RECIPES FROM A COOKBOOK.
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND, OH, HOW I GOT FULL
MANY NIGHTS
OFF OF THE ROAST BEEF
ON PAGE 27.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BUT A REALLY UNFORTUNATE THING
HAPPENED.
MY SISTER CAUGHT
A EAR INFECTION,
SO SHE STARVED TO DEATH.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I REALLY GREW UP A LOT
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.
I STAYED AT
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE,
ONE, BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST
A SWEET LADY,
AND TWO, BECAUSE SHE HAD FOOD.
BUT SHE HAD THIS REALLY CRAZY
OBSESSION WITH HER BILLS,
AND IT WAS THE LIGHT BILL
IN PARTICULAR.
EVERYTHING INVOLVED
THE LIGHT BILL.
"STOP RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE
LIKE THAT.
YOU GONNA RUN MY LIGHT BILL UP."
- [LAUGHTER]
- "STOP FLUSHING THAT TOILET
SO MUCH.
"YOU GONNA RUN
MY DAMN LIGHT BILL UP.
"STOP BREATHING SO MUCH.
YOU GONNA RUN MY LIGHT BILL UP."
I JUST FEEL LIKE I CAN BE MYSELF
AND JUST LET MY HAIR DOWN
WITH ALL OF YOU PEOPLE.
- OH!
- [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- GOOD TIMES.
IT'S A PARTY.
IT'S A PARTY.
YES.
- YOU KNOW, I'VE SUFFERED
FROM ADHD ALL OF MY LIFE.
IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE
EVERY DAY.
- AW.
- OOH, LOOK, A RHINESTONE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BUT I'M ALWAYS GETTING SHIT,
YOU KNOW.
"OH, YOU'RE SO SKINNY.
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST EAT SOMETHING,"
OR, "EAT A CHEESEBURGER,
YOU SKINNY BITCH."
AND ALL I WANT TO SAY IS, "WELL,
THEN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT.
I'M FUCKING STARVING."
SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE THEORY
GOING HERE.
EVER SINCE I'VE COME TO THE SHOW
AND I MET RuPAUL,
I HAVE A LITTLE THEORY HERE.
I'M GONNA RUN IT BY YOU.
I'VE SEEN RuPAUL IN THE WORKROOM
OUT OF DRAG.
I SEE RuPAUL HERE ON THE RUNWAY
AS A DRAG QUEEN.
NEVER IN THE SAME ROOM
AT THE SAME TIME.
BOTH RuPAULS--SAME PERSON.
PRETTY SURE I CRACKED THE CODE.
JUST SAYING.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE
THE CAST OF "COCOON" IS HERE.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.
MISS, I'M OVER HERE.
BRING BOTH EYES.
I'M RIGHT HERE.
DAMN, PEARL HARBOR
MUST HAVE DID YOU IN.
ON A LIGHTER NOTE, I'D LIKE TO
LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY.
MY MOTHER IS FROM CUBA,
AND MY DAD IS FROM HONDURAS,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I HAVE
A LARGE DICK, NO CREDIT,
AND A TENDENCY TO TAKE THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG TO ME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT WE STAY TRUE TO
OUR SPANISH HERITAGE,
SO MY FIRST WORDS
WERE, "HOUSEKEEPING."
- [LAUGHTER]
- I LIKE THE GENTLEMEN
IN THE BACK WHO'S SLEEPING.
MAKES ME FEEL RIGHT AT HOME.
CAN YOU WAKE THAT BITCH UP?
YEAH, THE ONE RIGHT THERE
WITH THE HORIZONTAL STRIPES.
NOT A GOOD LOOK IN YOUR THIRD
TRIMESTER, SIR, ALL RIGHT?
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL I'VE EVER HEARD
FROM THE JUDGES
WAS THAT WE NEED
TO SEE MORE VERSATILITY.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I GOT TO SAY TO Y'ALL
IS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU
VERSATILITY
WHEN SANTINO WINS
A SEWING COMPETITION
AND VISAGE WEARS A FUCKING
TURTLENECK, YOU HEAR ME?
- [LAUGHTER]
- AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
WELL, I GOT TO SAY, I HOPE
YOU GUYS HAD A LOT OF FUN,
AND BECAUSE
I'M FEELING EXTRA SPECIAL,
I'M GONNA PUT FRESH TENNIS BALLS
ON EVERY WALKER IN THE PLACE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- JELL-O ALL AROUND.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
MWAH.
- COMING UP...
- I GOT ZERO FUNNY FROM YOU.
- I JUST DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING
WAS REALLY DEVELOPED.
- THAT'S THE NIGHTCLUB, GIRL.
WHAT WE'RE TELLING YOU
IS WHAT IT TAKES.
- [SNIFFLES]
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR
THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
BRUCE YOU CAME OUT TO
THE DRIEST, COLDEST
HOUSE IMAGINABLE.
YOU GOT THEM LAUGHING.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
- LIKE, LITERALLY, MY NOTE SAYS,
"KILLED IT."
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, DARIENNE.
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- I THOUGHT YOU DID OK,
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA USE A SHTICK
LIKE A SONG,
THAT SHIT HAD BETTER BE THE
FUNNIEST SONG I'VE EVER HEARD.
- MM-HMM.
- AND IT WASN'T.
- BUT YOU'RE NOT
A STAND-UP COMIC,
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
VERY CLEVERLY CALCULATED
TO PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
ADORE DELANO.
- I LOVE THE CHARACTER.
YOU HAD SOME FUNNY JOKES,
BUT DON'T JUST THROW F-BOMBS
AROUND WILLY-NILLY
WHEN THEY'RE NOT ADDING
TO THE PARTY.
YOU'RE RELYING A LOT ON
YOUR CHARM AND PERSONALITY,
WHICH CONCERNS ME.
- [SNIFFLES]
I'M REALLY, REALLY TRYING.
I WANT TO KNOW THAT, LIKE,
I'M HERE...BECAUSE I DESERVE IT.
[SNIFFLES]
- ADORE, THE CHARMING THING
IS A GREAT PLUS,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH
IN YOUR TALENT.
- THANKS.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BENDELACREME.
- I'M KIND OF GETTING BORED
WITH THESE OLD SHOWGIRL LOOKS.
- I ACTUALLY CHOSE THIS
BECAUSE MICHELLE WAS SAYING THAT
SHE'D LIKE TO SORT OF SEE
MORE ME.
- BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR CLOTHES, BABY.
IT'S STEPPING OUT
OF THAT CHARACTER
AND SHOWING US
WHO YOU ARE INSIDE.
- WHILE YOU HAVE
INTELLIGENT JOKES,
YOU DIDN'T STOP LONG ENOUGH
TO LET YOUR CROWD LAUGH
OR HEAR THE JOKE.
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- I GOT ZERO FUNNY FROM YOU.
YOU DO THIS THING,
THIS "OKAY, OKAY."
I WANT YOU TO STRIP DOWN
THAT AFFECTED FACADE
THAT IS THERE,
AND THE FEW TIMES THAT
I'VE SEEN YOU NOT DO THAT,
I'VE STARTED TO WARM UP TO YOU.
ONCE YOU GO INTO THAT...
[BABBLING]
THEN WE LOSE YOU.
- TONIGHT WASN'T A CHARACTER,
AND I DO--
I DO TALK LIKE THAT,
AND I'M SORRY YOU...
- NO, NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS.
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK.
- PHEW.
I AM TRYING TOOTH AND NAIL
TO IMPRESS YOU GUYS.
- YOU WON THE CHALLENGE
LAST WEEK.
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A WIN, RU,
BECAUSE ALL I COULD HEAR WAS
MY CROTCH IS TOO LOW,
MY HAIR IS OFF.
AND I FEEL LIKE AN AMATEUR
UP HERE,
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU.
AND I DO LOVE MYSELF, AND
I DO BELIEVE I'M A SUPERSTAR,
AND I AM FIGHTING SO HARD
TO PROVE THAT TO YOU.
AND I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE TO BE A DRAG QUEEN,
AND I'M...
- BREATHE, BREATHE.
WE ALL DO THAT KIKI VOICE.
IT'S A FUNNY VOICE, BUT YOU
CAN'T DO THAT ALL THE TIME.
IT'S THE SAME NOTE WE HAD
FOR BENDELACREME.
IT SEPARATES YOU
FROM BEING HUMAN.
- YOU KNOW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
PEOPLE LOVE ME,
AND THEY THINK
I'M SUCH A PERFORMER,
AND THEY LOVE TO COME
AND SEE ME.
AND I GET SO BUILT UP--
- THAT'S THE NIGHTCLUB, GIRL.
YOU CAME IN THIS COMPETITION
TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHAT WE'RE TELLING YOU
IS WHAT IT TAKES,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
FUCKING STEER YOU WRONG,
NOT FOR NO GODDAMN TV SHOW.
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
I SAW SOMETHING IN YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO OWN YOUR STARDOM.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S MOVE ON.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- GIRL, YOU DID US PROUD
TONIGHT.
- [APPLAUSE]
- SO, TRINITY, I'MA TRY TO SAY
THIS WITHOUT GETTING EMOTIONAL.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IN THIS COMPETITION BEFORE,
THERE SEEMS TO BE A CERTAIN
DEFEATED ENERGY THAT I'VE SEEN,
AND I DO THE SAME THING MYSELF,
AND I HAVE TO...
[SIGHS]
I HAVE TO TALK MYSELF
OFF THAT LEDGE.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS YOU HAVE
OVERCOME YOUR SABOTEUR,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
- [APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN ME,
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAW SOMETHING
IN ME, AND I APPRECIATE IT.
- THANK YOU.
LET'S MOVE ON.
JOSLYN FOX.
- KNOWING THAT BIANCA DEL RIO
IS A COMIC,
WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF
BEFORE HER?
- I THOUGHT SHE'D BE A GREAT WAY
TO CLOSE THE SHOW.
- SHE IS A GREAT CLOSER,
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS
IT PUTS THE PERSON BEFORE HER
IN A REALLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION
IF YOU'RE NOT AS STRONG.
- THE FUNNIEST THING
WAS THE A.D.D. THING.
THAT'S A CHARACTER.
THE REST OF THE ROUTINE
COULD BE THAT GIRL.
- YOU STARTED OUT STRONG,
BUT THEN YOU JUST FLAT LINED.
YOU'RE LIKE A COMEDY TERRORIST.
YOU CAN FLY THE PLANE,
BUT YOU CAN'T LAND IT.
- ALL RIGHT, BIANCA DEL RIO.
- I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.
YOU'RE SO QUICK, BUT YOU KNOW
EXACTLY HOW TO LAND A JOKE
AND WHEN TO WAIT.
- YOU KILLED IT.
- THANKS.
- SO, SO, SO, SO, SO FUNNY.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING.
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORM DECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE REVS]
- JUST BETWEEN US GIRLS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE WAS COMFORTABLE
IN HER OWN SKIN.
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.
SHE HAS HEART.
SHE PLAYED TO THE AUDIENCE.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GREAT.
I LOVED HER.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- I THOUGHT HER ROUTINE
WAS AVERAGE.
- I THINK SHE WAS SMART
TO PLAY TO HER STRENGTH,
WHICH IS HER VOICE AND SINGING.
- BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- SHE'S SUCH AN INTERESTING
PRESENCE ON STAGE.
- IF SHE REALLY GOT RID
OF ALL THAT DOUBT,
SHE WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE.
- THINK OF YOURSELF AT THAT AGE,
YOU KNOW.
- HA! OH!
- TRY TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE
BACKSEAT OF CARS TO TELL YOU...
- [LAUGHTER]
- JUST SLAP THE DICK
OUT OF YOUR HAND
AND SAY, "MICHELLE, LISTEN."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.
- HER COMEDY WAS INTELLIGENT.
SHE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
COMIC TIMING.
- THE SMARTEST THING SHE DID
WAS,
WHEN THE HECKLER HAPPENED,
SHE GOT OFF.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- I JUST DON'T QUITE GET
THAT WHOLE CHARACTER
WHO SMOKES DOPE ALL THE TIME
AND YET CAN SPEAK FASTER
THAN THE BULLET TRAIN.
- WHEN YOU GET INTO
A BUSINESS LIKE THIS,
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THICK SKIN.
- YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE CRITICISM.
NOBODY'S SAYING
YOU'RE NOT TRYING, GIRL.
I'M SAYING
IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER.
- YEAH.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- I LOVED THAT SHE LAUGHED
AT HERSELF AND HER LIFE
AND ALLOWED US
TO DO THAT WITH HER.
- SHE FOLLOWED LAGANJA,
AND SHE MADE THEM STAND UP.
SHE CHANGED THE ENERGY
IN THE ROOM.
- JOSLYN FOX.
- SHE STARTED OUT VERY STRONG,
AND THEN IT JUST GOT LESS FUNNY.
- "OH, WOW, A RHINESTONE."
DONE.
- [LAUGHS]
- IT'S A WRAP.
- AND THEN THERE WAS BIANCA.
- THE SMART THING ABOUT HER IS,
SHE MAKES FUN OF HERSELF.
NOW SHE CAN MAKE FUN OF YOU.
- YES.
- I WANTED HER TO COME AFTER ME,
AND I WAS SITTING HERE, LIKE,
"DO ME. DO ME."
- WHEN YOU WANT SOMEBODY
TO RIP ON YOU, THAT'S A TALENT.
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY FUNNY GIRLS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
- [BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
DARIENNE LAKE, YOU'RE SAFE.
- HOLY TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU ARE SAFE.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
TONIGHT YOU DIDN'T JUST KILL IT.
YOU WERE A MASS MURDERER.
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE THE
WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- [APPLAUSE]
- AND YOU'VE WON A ONE-OF-A-KIND
CUSTOM GOWN BY MARCO MARCO.
- FABULOUS.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
COURTNEY, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
YOU AIMED HIGH,
BUT YOUR ROUTINE
WAS A BUZZ KILL.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE DELANO, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- BENDELACREME,
YOU ARE A SMART COOKIE,
BUT TONIGHT YOUR COMEDY ROUTINE
CRUMBLED.
JOSLYN FOX, YOU ARE
A LOVABLE QUEEN,
BUT--AND IT'S QUITE
AN IMPRESSIVE BUTT--
YOUR PUNCH LINES FLAT LINED.
BENDELACREME, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
- JOSLYN, MY DEAR, I AM SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK, AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

DIDN'T WORK OUT IN MY FAVOR,
BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY
A JOURNEY FOR ME.

THE CAST OF "COCOON" IS HERE.
- IT'S VERY DRY.
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF
LIKE YOUR VAGINA, OK?
TONIGHT WASN'T A CHARACTER,
AND I DO LIKE--I DO TALK LIKE
THAT, AND I'M SORRY.
- NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS.
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK.
- THIS IS ALL
TOO MUCH FOR ME.
YOU WIN.
YOU BROKE ME DOWN,
I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
AND OBVIOUSLY I'M ANNOYING.
- BIANCA DEL RIO,
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.

LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SASHAY AWAY.
- WOW. HOLY CRAP.
- GIRL, THIS HAS BEEN A DAY.
- OH, WHAT DID THIS
BITCH LEAVE ON THE MIRROR?
- NOT MUCH.
- THAT'S IT?
- WELL...
- WELL, I MEAN, NO, SHE DID
SAY THAT SHE FELT LIKE,
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE HERE DID
NOT LIKE HER, SO, I MEAN, WHAT
OF MUCH DO YOU REALLY
EXPECT FROM HER?
I MEAN, COME ON.
SHE GONE NOW.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT'S A NEW CHAPTER, SO...
- I FEEL SORT OF AWKWARD
ABOUT THE WAY IT ENDED.
- IT WAS JUST VERY DARK
AND UGLY, AND THAT WAS NOT CUTE.
IT JUST SUCKS THAT SHE LEFT
ON THAT NOTE, AND WE COULDN'T,
LIKE, REALLY PATCH SHIT UP.
I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
- IT WASN'T A GREAT
WAY TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
- IT WAS NOT.
- IT WASN'T HER FAULT.
IT WAS BIANCA THAT MADE THE...
- OH, IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT IS
YOUR FAULT, BIANCA?
- WHAT?
- WINNING THAT
FUCKING CHALLENGE.
- YES, AND I
STOLE YOUR MOMENT.
- OH, YOU WON.
- I'M STEALING EVERYTHING.
- BAM.
- THIS WAS TRINITY'S
TIME TO SHINE.
- COME ON, BITCH.
- I DIDN'T GO HOME,
AND I GOT SAFE,
AND RU GOT EMOTIONAL.
- SHE DID.
- I'M SO SURPRISED THAT THAT
WENT WELL, AND I THINK RU
PULLED SOMETHING OUT OF ME
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD,
AND NOW MY WHOLE
MISSION IS JUST TO WIN
A FUCKING CHALLENGE.
- HONESTLY, I HAVE TO SAY
AS BADLY AS I KNEW THAT I DID
WITH THIS CHALLENGE, I REALLY
DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA BE
IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT I
FELL KIND OF MIDDLE.
- JOSLYN'S JUST KIND OF
LIKE COASTING THROUGH
THE COMPETITION.
SHE'S LIKE THE DIDA RITZ
OF THIS SERIES, REALLY.
- JOSLYN IS NOT AS POLISHED

- YOU'VE WON A YEAR SUPPLY
OF EYELASHES FROM EYLURE.
LADIES, AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR NOT ONLY NEEDS TO
KNOW HOW TO SISSY THAT WALK,
SHE NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO SISSY THAT TALK.
NOW, FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE HOSTING
YOUR VERY OWN TALK SHOW.
IT'S TIME FOR THE RETURN
OF "THE RUPAUL SHOW."
- YAY.
- NOW, I BOOKED SOME EXTRA
SPECIAL GUESTS FOR YOU
TO INTERVIEW.
MY PAL CHAZ BONO!
- [GASPING]
- AND HIS GRANDMOTHER,
CHER'S MOM, SINGER GEORGIA HOLT.
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I LOVE CHAZ BONO,
AND GEORGIA HOLT--
MM, I'M A COUNTRY BOY.
I LOVE MY COUNTRY MUSIC,
AND SHE JUST HAS A VOICE
LIKE NO OTHER.
- I AM GOING TO BE ONE DEGREE
OF SEPARATION AWAY FROM CHER!
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- I'VE BEEN READ A LOT ON
THE RUNWAY FOR MY LOOKS,
SO THE FIRST THING I'M
GONNA DO IS CHOOSE MY LOOK.
- SO I NOTICE THAT EVERYBODY
IN THE ROOM IS WORKING
ON THEIR RESEARCH, AND JOSLYN
RUNS TO HER CLOSET TO PULL OUT
3 UGLY DRESSES.
REALLY? I THOUGHT FOR SURE
SHE'D HAVE WORN ONE
OF HER NON-BIKINIS.
THIS IS A SPECIAL EVENT.
- THE JUDGES HAVE BEEN PRETTY
CONSISTENT IN WHAT THEY'VE
SAID TO JOSLYN ABOUT HER
RUNWAY LOOKS, BUT I DON'T
THINK SHE'S GETTING THE NOTE.
- SHIT. I'M GONNA BE OK.
- COMING UP...
WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR
EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE
PAULA ABDUL.
- [GASPING]
- I KNOW THIS PERSON.
- SHIT'S GETTING REAL.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- OUR MAIN CHALLENGE TODAY
IS TO BE THE GUEST HOST
FOR RUPAUL'S TALK SHOW.
WE HAVE TO INTERVIEW CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT,
AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT
INTIMIDATING.
- CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MANY
TIMES THEY'VE ANSWERED
THESE SAME QUESTIONS?
- RIGHT.
- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO
MAKE IT LIGHT AND AIRY,
LIKE A FART.
- [LAUGHS]
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HOW ARE MY HOSTESS
TWINKIES DOING?
- RESEARCH.
- ADORE DELANO, HOW
ARE YOU DOING?
- OK, I'M FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO
COME NATURAL.
WHEN I WRITE SHIT DOWN, IT
GETS LIKE,
"OH, GOD, I'M--"
LIKE...
- BUT THIS IS THE THING, AND
THIS TIES INTO THE CRITIQUE
YOU GOT LAST WEEK ON
THE JUDGE'S PANEL, WHICH IS THAT
IF YOU'RE PREPARED,
YOU'LL BE FINE.
- RIGHT.
- ADORE'S REALLY CONFIDENT
IN CERTAIN AREAS, BUT IF IT'S
OUTSIDE OF HER COMFORT ZONE,
SHE KIND OF CRUMBLES.
I DON'T THINK SHE
TRUSTS HERSELF ENOUGH.
- CAN I HEAR A LITTLE
BIT OF YOUR OPENING?
- "HELLO, EVERYONE,
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.
"I'LL BE FILLING IN FOR
MISS RUPAUL TONIGHT,
SO I'M GONNA"--
OH, WHAT?
SO--OK, WAIT.
- I'M A BIT WORRIED.
- GET BACK TO
WORK, ALL RIGHT?
- THIS IS GONNA
BE A HOT MESS.
- J-J-J-JOSLYN FOX.
- HEY, RUZIE Q.
- HA HA HA! QUICK QUESTION.
HOW MANY STRAPS ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR FOR THE INTERVIEW?
- ZERO.
- HA HA HA!
BEFORE THIS, DID YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CHAZ
OR GEORGIA HOLT?
- I LOVE CHAZ WITH
HIS TRANSITION.
I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY
FORTHCOMING, AND GEORGIA I
BECAME FAMILIAR WITH AFTER
THE LIFETIME DOCUMENTARY.
YOU KNOW, SHE LOST THE ROLE
TO MARILYN MONROE
FOR "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE"?
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
LOVE HER.
- YES.
SO YOUR BIG OPENING--
HAVE YOU WORKED ON THAT?
- I HAVE. I HAVE.
PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE WHO
CAME OUT OF CHER'S VAGINA
AND THE VAGINA
CHER CAME OUT OF.
- I'M JUST A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE TALKING
ABOUT CHER'S VAGINA
COULD POSSIBLY OFFEND
MOTHER AND SON.
- BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE ENTERTAINMENT LIES.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT QUEEN THAT PISSED OFF
CHER'S FAMILY.
HELLO?
- LISTEN, WE'RE DOWN TO JUST
VERY FEW GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE GUMBO GETS THINNED
OUT, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH.
- I LIKE GUMBO, SO...
- HA HA HA!
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR YOU.
GET BACK TO IT.
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.
HA HA HA!
DELA.
- HI, RU.
- SO THIS IS
A BIG CHALLENGE HERE.
- IT IS, YEAH.
- IS THIS CHALLENGE GONNA
ALLOW THE JUDGES TO SEE
THE REAL YOU?
- UM, I...I THINK SO.
I THINK IT'LL BE NICE TO
BE ABLE TO BE BRINGING SOME
VERSION OF THE CHARACTER,
BUT THEY CAN HAVE A GENUINE
CONVERSATION AND
REALLY BE LISTENING.
- RIGHT, AND BECAUSE DELA IS
A CHARACTER THAT YOU DO, I GET
A SENSE THAT YOU'RE
A BIT OF AN INTROVERT.
- I TEND TO BE
VERY PRIVATE MYSELF.
- SO THE QUESTION BECOMES,
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
OF PEOPLE SEEING?
- CERTAINLY, I CAN BE
MORE NEGATIVE, YOU KNOW.
I'VE STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION
A LOT IN MY LIFE, NOT FEELING
GOOD ENOUGH, NOT FEELING
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.
THIS CHARACTER IS SOMEBODY WHO
HELPED ME TO BE MORE POSITIVE,
AND I'M HOPING THAT NOW I CAN
HAVE HER LEARN FROM ME HOW TO,
YOU KNOW, HAVE MORE OF
THE HEART THAT I THINK THAT
THE JUDGES ARE DESCRIBING.
- ABSOLUTELY, I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ON THE MONEY THERE.
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- HOWDY, HOWDY.
- HOWDY, HOWDY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN INTERVIEW STAR.
- I KNOW. ISN'T
THAT EXCITING?
- TALK SHOW.
- YEAH.
I HAD A QUESTION.
I'VE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH FUN
IN THE COMPETITION,
AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE,
"OH, I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
I'M DOING A GOOD JOB."
AND THEN WHEN I GET TO THE
JUDGES, I KIND OF GET GOOD
FEEDBACK BUT A BIT
KIND OF LUKEWARM.
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF
YOU HAD ANY MAYBE SPECIFIC
POINTS OR THINGS THAT I
COULD PAY ATTENTION TO.
- YOU'RE VERY POLISHED.
YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THAT, BUT
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
ALSO HAS SOFT, TENDER
PARTS AND WHO'S ALSO AS
HARD AS STEEL.
- MMM.
- SO FULLY ROUNDED,
AND THIS IS THE
PERFECT CHALLENGE TO
PUT THAT TO THE TEST.
- RU'S ASKING ME TO GIVE
SOMETHING MORE, LIKE HUMANITY
AND VULNERABILITY, SO I NEED
TO WORK OUT HOW I CAN BRING
THAT INTO THE INTERVIEW.
- TRINITY K. BONET.
OH, MY GOODNESS,
THAT BREAKTHROUGH LAST WEEK.
YOU MUST FEEL ON TOP
OF THE WORLD.
- I DO. I DO.
- WHAT CAN YOU TAKE FROM
THAT BREAKTHROUGH AND APPLY TO
THIS CHALLENGE?
- I THINK THE ADVANTAGE OF
THIS CHALLENGE IS THAT I GET
TO BE MYSELF AND HAVE MY OWN
SENSE OF PERSONALITY AND PLAY
WITH THE QUESTIONS
THE WAY I CHOOSE TO.
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
- YOU'VE COME VERY CLOSE,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T WON
A CHALLENGE YET.
- NO, AND THAT'S THE GOAL.
RU HAS GIVEN ME QUITE A FEW
CHANCES, SO NOW THAT I FEEL
LIKE I'M IN THE GAME, I
REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS.
- ALL RIGHT,
LADIES, GATHER ROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW ON THE MAIN STAGE,
WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR
EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.
PAULA ABDUL...
- [GASPING]
- WILL BE HERE.
STRAIGHT UP, Y'ALL.
- PAULA ABDUL JUDGMENT--I WAS
ON "AMERICAN IDOL" ON SEASON 7,
AND TO KNOW THAT SHE'S
GONNA BE HERE TONIGHT SEEING
ME AS A FULL-FLEDGED BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN OF THE OCEAN, I'M REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
LIKE, HI, PAULA,
I'M A GIRL NOW.
- NOW, IN A FEW MOMENTS, YOU
WILL HEAD TO THE STUDIO TO
LAUNCH YOUR TV
TALK SHOW CAREERS.
IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY BIG SHOW,
SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S
A LOT TO JUGGLE.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- WHAT'D HE SAY?
- AND HE SAID THAT I'M VERY
POLISHED, BUT THEY'RE NOT
SEEING ANY HUMANNESS TO ME.
- LIKE, OBVIOUSLY, WE LOVE
PEOPLE WHO ARE, LIKE, GREAT
AT THINGS, BUT WE ALSO LOVE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WEAKNESSES.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
RELATABLE, BUT YOU'RE
AN ALIEN, SO...
- [LAUGHS]
- I KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN
BE TOO POLISHED OR A LITTLE
BIT STEPFORDY.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT
WILLING TO BE VULNERABLE,
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING,
I'M JUST HAPPY OR HAPPIER.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
THAT'S KIND OF HOW MY BRAIN
WORKS, OR I'VE--THROUGH A LOT
OF MEDITATION, I FIND THAT
MY LIFE IS VERY CAREFREE.
I HAVE, LIKE, A LOT OF
PASSION AND ENJOYMENT.
- SEE I'M ALREADY ALIENATED
RIGHT NOW TALKING TO YOU.
- HA HA HA!
- COMING UP...
- HELLO, WELCOME
TO "THE RUPAUL SHOW."
- PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME OUT TWICE SINCE
COMING OUT OF CHER AND SOMEONE
WHO'S CAME BACK 66 YEARS
AFTER CHER CAME OUT OF HER.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- 5, 4, 3, 2...
- ♪ SO HERE IT COMES
ROUND AGAIN ♪
♪ HEARTBEAT FAST
MY HEAD IS SPINNING ♪
- TODAY'S MAIN
CHALLENGE IS TO GUEST HOST
"THE RUPAUL SHOW."
HELLO, WELCOME TO
"THE RUPAUL SHOW."
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.
- I'M THE FOXY JOSLYN FOX.
- I AM TRINITY K. BONET,
AND I AM FILLING--
FILLING IN FOR RUPAUL TONIGHT.
- I'M THE FIRST UP
TO INTERVIEW CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT.
THIS IS LIVE TV, SO I JUST AM
KIND OF SHAKING IN MY HEELS.
THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR.
LIKE, I'M FREAKING
OUT RIGHT NOW.
JUST SAY--OW, MY RING GOT
CAUGHT INTO MY FISHNET.
HA HA HA! LET ME SEE.
HMM.
OH, OK.
WELL, LET ME
REFER TO MY NOTES.
I'M STILL FRESH.
SORRY.
SO I READ THAT YOU
WERE PERFORMING
AT THE AGE OF 7.
WERE YOU, LIKE, THE BIG,
LIKE, CHILDHOOD STAR OF YOUR,
LIKE, COMMUNITY?
- NO, HONEY, WE WERE
BROKE, AND IT WAS DURING
THE DEPRESSION.
- PARTY.
MY MOM ALWAYS PUSHES ME,
AND SO, LIKE, I WAS WONDERING,
WELL, DID YOU HAVE,
LIKE, A STAGE DADDY?
'CAUSE I CALL MY
MOM STAGE MAMA.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.
WE HAD NO MONEY.
- OH.
- AND THERE WAS NO FOOD.
SO I WOULD GO AND SING,
AND PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
ME NICKELS AND DIMES AND...
- RIGHT.
I'M HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME
WITH THIS TALK SHOW SHIT.
I DIDN'T KNOW SO
MUCH GOES INTO IT.
I THOUGHT YOU JUST
MEET YOUR GUEST,
YOU HAVE A PARTY,
YOU HAVE A CUTE LITTLE MUG.
I'M LIKE, "FUCK. SHIT'S
GETTING REAL."
OH, THAT'S AMAZING, THOUGH.
- IT WAS DURING
THE DEPRESSION.
- OK.
- YEP, YEAH.
- THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S SO COOL.
- IN YOUR ORIGINAL BOOK,
"FAMILY OUTING," YOU DISCUSSED
HOW AT 13 THAT
YOU FELT DIFFERENT.
- RIGHT.
- COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?
- SURE. AS MY
HORMONES STARTED TO GO,
I HAD AN ATTRACTION TOWARDS
WOMEN, AND SO I NATURALLY JUST
MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT I
MUST BE GAY AND THAT MUST BE
WHAT ALL THESE FEELINGS ARE.
- NOW, OF COURSE,
IN 1995, YOU CAME
OUT PUBLICLY.
WHAT WAS YOUR
FATHER'S THOUGHTS?
- HE WAS COMFORTABLE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST PERSON
IN THE FAMILY THAT I
TALKED TO WAS MY GRANDMA.
- REALLY?
- AND, OF COURSE,
SHE WAS AMAZING.
- AND THEN
THE MAGICAL EXPERIENCE
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
HOW WAS THAT?
- BIANCA TALKED TO ME
A LOT AND KIND OF IGNORED MY
GRANDMOTHER A LITTLE BIT, SO
I WAS THROWING HER THESE KIND
OF BALLS OF, LIKE, "HERE,
LET'S INCLUDE HER IN THIS."
- WAS IT LIBERATING TO
BE IN THAT MOMENT?
YOU KNOW, LEARNING THE DANCES
AND DEALING WITH ALL OF IT IS
PRETTY GREAT.
OH, GREAT, SO THE STAGE
MANAGER'S TELLING ME I'VE GOT
TO WRAP IT UP, AND I HAVEN'T
ASKED MISS GEORGIA ANYTHING.
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO,
SO VERY MUCH.
SHIT.
- HA HA HA!
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED, YOU KNOW.
NOT NERVOUS EXCITED,
BUT REALLY EXCITED.
AND I HAVE A TON OF
QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS.
WELL, CHAD.
CHAD, I KNOW THAT YOU DO A
LOT IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
- TRINITY KEPT CALLING ME
CHAD, AND GOLDEN RULE--YOU GOT
TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON
THAT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.
- OK, SO CHAD, ARE YOU
A BOXER OR BRIEF TYPE OF GUY?
- THAT, TO ME, WAS A PROBLEM.
- HA HA HA!
- CHAD, IF YOU HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT ON A--
ON A DATE WITH MEGAN FOX,
ANGELINA JOLIE, OR--
I NEED ONE MORE PERSON.
IT WAS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ME
OR IF IT WAS THEM.
THIS INTERVIEW WAS WEIRD.
HA HA. WELL, THANK YOU
CHAD BONO AND GEORGIA HOLT.
- GEORGIA, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE
JUST RELEASED YOUR FIRST
EVER ALBUM.
YOU RECORDED THE ALBUM 30 YEARS
AGO, AND THEN 30 YEARS
LATER, YOU FIND THESE TAPES.
THAT MUST BE KIND OF COOL.
- CHER ASKED ME, "MOM, WHAT'D
YOU DO WITH THOSE TAPES?"
AND I SAID, "HONEY, I THINK
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE."
- THIS MUST BE A PRETTY
WELL-ORGANIZED GARAGE.
LIKE, 30--
- HA HA HA!
- I MEAN, I'VE GOT THINGS
FROM, YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
- I SAVE EVERYTHING.
- IT'S NOT AN EPISODE OF
"HOARDERS" WAITING TO HAPPEN,
I'M GUESSING. OR IS IT?
- NO.
- NO.
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE
THE DOCUMENTARY "BECOMING CHAZ."
- MM-HMM.
- AND WHAT WAS THE DECISION
THAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO
SO PUBLIC WITH SUCH
A PERSONAL THING?
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
A NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE I KNEW I
WAS TRANSGENDER BUT WAS AFRAID
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND SO IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR
ME TO KIND OF GIVE THAT BACK.
I FIGURED THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE
OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO ARE--
WHO ARE STUCK.
- THAT'S SO COOL.
- COURTNEY CAME ACROSS
VERY PROFESSIONAL
AND VERY LIKEABLE.
I THOUGHT SHE HAD A LOT OF
CHARM, DIDN'T YOU THINK, CHAZ?
- I DID, ABSOLUTELY.
- HA HA HA!
- NO.
I LOVE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.
A HUGE THING FOR
AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.
- SO, CHAZ, ARE THERE ANY KIND
OF TRAITS THAT YOU WOULD SAY
THAT YOU REALLY KIND OF
PULLED FROM YOUR MOTHER CHER?
- NO.
- NO? HEH.
UM, RIGHT.
NOW, BESIDES THE DROP IN THE
IQ AND REMEMBERING TO PUT THE
SEAT DOWN, HAS THEIR BEEN,
LIKE, HARD THINGS THAT YOU'VE
HAD TO, LIKE, ADJUST
TO NOW BEING A MAN?
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- HA HA HA!
- GEORGIA, ARE THERE ANYTHING
ABOUT, LIKE, THE MUSIC TODAY--
DO YOU--DO YOU CONSIDER,
LIKE, MAYBE DOING A TOUR
OF YOUR ALBUM?
- HA HA HA! NOT AT 87.
- NO?
- NO.
- RIGHT, AND I HAVE ONE MORE
QUESTION FOR YOU, MY DEAR.
ARE YOU...
♪ PURE CHEROKEE ♪
- HA HA!
I DON'T KNOW, SHE JUST
WAS FUN TO ME.
- BUT SHE SEEMED TO
BE GETTING THROWN.
JEWELRY SEEMED TO BE FALLING
OFF OF HER, AND SHE SEEMED
A LITTLE PHYSICALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.
- WELL, GEORGIA, WHAT IS IT
LIKE TO HAVE AN ALBUM THAT YOU
RECORDED 31 YEARS AGO
HITTING THE CHARTS RIGHT NOW?
- IT FEELS FANTASTIC.
I STARTED IN SINGING WHEN I
WAS 6 DURING THE DEPRESSION.
- MY GOODNESS.
- YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE DEPRESSION.
- WELL, I'VE
EXPERIENCED OTHER KINDS
OF DEPRESSION, BUT...
- HA HA HA! VERY FUNNY.
- AND, NOW, CHAZ, YOU
ALSO HAVE A RECENT PROJECT,
"INDEPENDENCE DAY."
- YEAH, WE ACTUALLY
CLOSE TONIGHT.
- HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CHANCE
TO SEE CHAZ'S MUSICAL AT ALL?
- I HAVEN'T.
- IT'S CLOSING NIGHT.
- I KNOW IT.
I KNOW IT.
- COULD YOU MAYBE HUM
US A FEW BARS?
MAYBE GEORGIA WILL JUST--
MAYBE SHE COULD GET
A SNEAK PEEK RIGHT NOW?
- VERY FUNNY.
- I ACTUALLY REALLY
LIKED BENDELACREME.
I THOUGHT SHE ASKED SMART
AND INTERESTING QUESTIONS.
- THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.
- YOU WERE GOOD.
WELL DONE.
- WELL DONE.
- PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME OUT TWICE SINCE
COMING OUT OF CHER AND SOMEONE
WHO'S CAME BACK 66 YEARS
AFTER CHER CAME OUT OF HER.
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, GEORGIA.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
- REALLY?
- I LOVE YOUR CD.
"I'M JUST YOUR YESTERDAY"--
WILL THAT END UP ON CHER'S
NEW ALBUM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
RECORDING HER PART.
- OK.
- AND I DON'T REMEMBER
RECORDING MY PART.
- OK, WELL, I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT I HAD
FOR BREAKFAST TODAY,
SO WE'RE EVEN.
HEE HEE HEE. NOW, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR A LAST-MINUTE DECISION
AT THE ABORTION CLINIC,
THE WORLD WOULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN CHER.
ARE YOU PRO LIFE?
HAS YOUR STANCE CHANGED AT
ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME?
- I THINK--I ACTUALLY--
I DON'T--I REALLY DON'T
KNOW HOW I FEEL.
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSING TO ME, AND I WAS
TRYING TO THINK OF HOW
TO, YOU KNOW, RECOVER.
- YEAH, IT WAS PUTTING HER
ON THE SPOT IN A WAY THAT YOU
DON'T--YOU KNOW, WHY
WOULD YOU EVER ASK THAT?
- HEE HEE. I FEEL SOME REALLY
GOOD RAPPORT BETWEEN ME,
CHAZ, AND GEORGIA.
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE I'VE
KNOWN THEM ALL MY LIFE,
AND THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM
OPENING UP TO ME.
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.
I'VE GOT THIS ONE IN THE BAG.
HEE HEE. THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE, AND I'M ALL OUT
OF DUCT TAPE.
KEEP IT FOXY.
- COMING UP...
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?
- LIKE, A MORTAL
KOMBAT CHARACTER.
- YOU CAME IN MIDDLE
OF THE PACK TO ME.

- AND CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT,
I HOPE MY QUEENS GAVE YOU
THE STAR TREATMENT.
- THEY DID.
THANK YOU.

HONKY TONK WOMAN.

ALBUM, ISN'T IT, GEORGIA?
- YES, IT IS.
- I LOVE "LOVE ME TENDER."
IT'S FANTASTIC.
- THANK YOU.
- AND A POP ICON WHO IS
FOREVER MY GIRL, THE ONE
AND ONLY PAULA ABDUL.
HI, BABY.
- I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
- NOW, DID YOU KNOW THAT
YOU ARE THE MOST LIP-SYNCHED
ARTIST IN
THE HERSTORY OF "DRAG RACE"?
- THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.
I FEEL HONORED.
- THIS WEEK WE CHALLENGED
OUR QUEENS TO BECOME TALK SHOW
HOSTESSES WITH THE MOSTESSES,
AND TONIGHT THEY'RE GOING WILD
ON THE RUNWAY IN THEIR OWN
ANIMAL KINGDOM COUTURE.
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR SOME JUNGLE FEVER.
[LAUGHTER]
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
- UP FIRST, DARIENNE LAKE.
MICHELLE, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
THIS, BUT THERE'S AN ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM.
- YES.
- ELEPHANTS ARE LUCKY.
THEY'RE FABULOUS,
AND I'M SERVING YOU ALL OF MY
ELEPHANT GLORY.
- ALL THAT JUNK
IN THAT TRUNK.
- HORTON HEARS A HO.
- HA HA!
- ADORE DELANO.
NICE GRILL.
- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO
GREAT WITH ADORE'S OUTFIT?
- NO.
- A CHIANTI
AND SOME FAVA BEANS.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M FUCKING SERVING
ANIMAL KINGDOM COUTURE.
I'M FEELING REALLY SEXY.
- "SILENCE OF THE QUEENS."
- I THINK SHE'S MASKING
A LOT OF PAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
- BENDELACREME.
- OH.
- OOH.
WAITER, THERE'S A FLY
ON MY RUNWAY.
[LAUGHTER]
- BE AFRAID.
- YES.
- BE VERY AFRAID.
- YES.
- I'M JUST BUZZING
DOWN THE RUNAWAY.
I'M FEELING THE FANTASY.
- SHE'S GOT SOME
FLY CHOREOGRAPHY.
- YEAH, SHE'S A FLY GIRL.
SHE BUGGING.
NEXT UP, BIANCA DEL RIO,
CHEETAH GIRL.
- CAN A QUEEN REALLY
CHANGE HER SPOTS?
- YOU KNOW THE SAYING--
BIG CATS ARE DANGEROUS,
BUT A LITTLE PUSSY
NEVER HURT ANYBODY.
- THAT IS SOME POINTER
SISTERS HAIR RIGHT THERE.
- SHE'S SO EXCITED.
- HMM.
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.
SHE'S A RED FOX.
- SHE'S A COCK.
- YES, SHE IS.
- OHH!
- I'VE GOT MY TALONS AND MY
FEATHERS, AND I'M SHOWING OFF
SOME SKIN, AND I'M FEELING
REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.
- I THINK IT'S SOME KIND
OF JUNGLE PUSSY...CAT.
[LAUGHTER]
- FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA,
TRINITY K. BONET, THE PHOENIX.
- SHE'S AWFULLY
PLUCKED TONIGHT.
- YES.
- I AM GIVING YOU BIRDS OF
A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
RHYTHMS, AND I LOOK
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.
- DRESSED TO QUILL.
YOU BETTER SISSY THAT SQUAWK.
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- OH.
- MM.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
HEAVEN MUST BE
MISSING AN ANGEL.
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THOSE WINGS.
- YES.
PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF.
- I'M GIVING
SOME REGAL EAGLE.
I WANT TO SEE THIS ON BLOGS.
I WANT TO SEE
THIS ON FACEBOOK.
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA
TOP THIS SHIT.
- MM, THINK I'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN.
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH.
BABY, THESE GIRLS ARE
GIVING PRODUCTION VALUE.
- OK.
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, DARIENNE, IT'S COLDER
IN HERE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.
- OOH.
[LAUGHTER]
- TONIGHT YOUR
LOOK IS INSPIRED.
I LOVE THE GRAY HAIR,
AND YOUR FACE LOOKS GORGEOUS.
AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
YOU SEEMED REALLY NERVOUS.
- REALLY?
- YOU DID.
- YEAH, I GOT THE SENSE THAT
YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.
YOU CAME IN MIDDLE OF
THE PACK TO ME.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT
UP, ADORE DELANO.
- HI.
- WHAT WILD LIFE ANIMAL
ARE YOU REPRESENTING?
- LIKE, A PANTHER,
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO LOOK LIKE
A MORTAL KOMBAT CHARACTER.
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS LOOK.
LOVE THE FACE.
I LOVE YOUR MAKEUP.
I LOVE YOU, BUT ALL THESE
PIECES--IT'S JUST NOT
ELEVATING IT UP ENOUGH.
- I'M HEARING YOU CONVERSE.
I'M GOING,
"I KNOW THIS PERSON."
- SEASON 7 "AMERICAN"--
- YES, "AMERICAN IDOL."
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
BUT WHAT I'D LIKE IS TO
NOT SEE THIS MASK.
IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO
THE AMAZING PERSONALITY THAT I
REMEMBER SO WELL.
- YOU JUST SEEMED REALLY
NERVOUS DURING OUR INTERVIEW.
- I WAS.
- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
YOU WERE REALLY STRUGGLING
THROUGH IT.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME,
FLY, FLY, FLY, FLY.
HA HA HA!
- I THINK YOU DID A GREAT
JOB WITH THE INTERVIEWS.
YOU WERE REALLY UP-TO-DATE
ON EVERYTHING THAT BOTH
OF US WERE DOING.
YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.
- THERE'S A SENSE OF
SOMETHING'S BEEN DROPPED,
AND IT'S SO MUCH
MORE ENDEARING.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BLAME IT ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ALWAYS BLAMING ME.
[LAUGHTER]
- I LOVE HOW YOU DID THE BODY
PAINT AND THE FACE PAINT TO
MATCH WITH THE DRESS.
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT.
- THANK YOU.
- BUT WITH THE INTERVIEW,
YOU WEREN'T REALLY FOCUSING
ON THE OTHER PERSON THAT WAS
THERE, WHICH WAS MY GRANDMA.
- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR
MISS GEORGIA THAT I WANTED TO
ASK, BUT TIME MANAGEMENT
DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.
- IS THERE A QUESTION YOU'D
LIKE TO ASK GEORGIA NOW?
- WELL, I WANTED TO ASK
THEM IF THEY BELIEVE
IN LIFE AFTER LOVE.
[LAUGHTER]
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX
ON THE RUNWAY.
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?
- I'M A GLAMAZONIAN
WARRIOR PRINCESS.
I'M FRIENDS WITH ALL
THE ANIMALS,
AND THEN I TAKE THEM,
AND I SKIN THEM ALIVE.
I'M THE DIANE SAWYER
OF THE JUNGLE.
- I'M NOT SEEING WHAT I
WANT FROM YOU WITH THIS.
IT'S NOT QUITE
ANIMAL ENOUGH.
- NOW, ON TO THE TALK SHOW.
YOU HAD ME WITH YOU, THEN
DECIDED TO GO ALL HARD NEWS.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT ABORTION?
- UH...
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.
- YOU SAY YOUR CHARACTER
SKINS ANIMALS ALIVE.
WELL, IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE
SKINNING YOUR GUESTS ALIVE.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.
- GEORGIA, WERE YOU OFFENDED?
- I WAS UNEASY.
IT MADE ME UNEASY.
- THAT WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF
MY BIGGEST MISTAKES I'VE EVER
MADE BECAUSE I JUST ADORE YOU,
AND IT BREAKS MY HEART, AND I
WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF
I IN ANY WAY OFFENDED YOU.
- THANK YOU, HONEY.
THANK YOU.
EVERYTHING YOU SAID WAS VERY
SWEET, AND I APPRECIATE IT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY GREAT UP UNTIL
THAT ONE REMARK.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- HOWDY.
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH IN MY
HETEROSEXUALITY TO SAY WOW.
- HA HA AH!
YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE.
I LIKE HANCOCK.
[LAUGHTER]
- THE SECOND I SAW YOU ON
CAMERA, I WAS ENGAGED, AND I
FELT LIKE YOU WERE A
GIRLFRIEND, AND THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO A VIEWER TO FEEL
LIKE THEY CAN RELATE TO YOU.
- NEXT STOP, TRINITY K. BONET.
- YOUR WHOLE LOOK, EVERYTHING
IS SO WELL THOUGHT OUT.
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL--
JUST GORGEOUS.
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW...
RULE NUMBER ONE, WHEN YOU HAVE
A GUEST, YOU NEED
TO KNOW THEIR NAME.
YOU KEPT CALLING CHAZ "CHAD,"
AND THAT IN AND OF ITSELF
WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.
- WHEN MY NERVES GET THE
BEST OF ME, IT TAKES A TOLL.
- TRINITY, HONEY, I
STARTED WORKING ON TELEVISION
IN 1949, BUT DOING
THE SHOW TODAY, I WAS NERVOUS,
AND I'M AN OLD PRO, YOU KNOW?
SO YOU'LL GET OVER IT,
AND YOU'LL BECOME SO PROUD.
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.
- I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE STARTS]
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US CHATTY CATHYS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH
DARIENNE LAKE.
- I LOVED HER COSTUME, BUT
HER INTERVIEW--I THINK THAT
THE NERVES GOT TO HER.
I REMEMBER THAT SHE GAVE
A CHER IMPERSONATION, AND IT WAS
LIKE YOU COULD HEAR CRICKETS.
[LAUGHTER]
- YEAH, I MEAN, GIVE ME,
YOU KNOW, CHAD MICHAELS OR--
- TOTALLY.
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
ADORE DELANO.
- I WAS HOPING TO SEE THAT
SAME SASSINESS AND SMART MOUTH
THAT I CAME TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH ON "AMERICAN IDOL,"
BUT I DIDN'T GET
TO SEE IT TODAY.
- SHE WAS SO NERVOUS,
SHE COULDN'T GROUND HERSELF.
I THINK SHE PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE HAD HER NOTES WRITTEN
SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T
BE CONFUSED.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I
SAID 10 SECONDS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
- SHE EPITOMIZES THAT YOUNG KID
WHO HASN'T QUITE CONNECTED
THE DOTS WITH HER TALENT, HER
INTELLECT, AND THIS CHALLENGE
REALLY SHOWED THAT, YOU KNOW.
YOU MAKE ONE MISSTEP, AND--
- AND THEN MERLE COMES BACK?
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME?
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO BENDELACREME.
- I THOUGHT HER
COSTUME WAS INCREDIBLE.
SHE EVIDENTLY HAS STUDIED
FLIES WALKING ACROSS
THE FLOOR, BECAUSE SHE
DID IT PERFECT.
- YEAH, WE'RE
SEEING BENDELA NOW.
THERE'S THIS WALL THAT'S
BEEN KIND OF KNOCKED DOWN,
AND THAT TRANSLATED
IN HER TALK SHOW.
DESPITE WEARING THE MOST
HIDEOUS COLOR EVER CREATED...
- HA HA HA!
- SHE WAS FANTASTIC.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THE THING ABOUT BIANCA
IS, SHE'S SO SMART
AND PROFESSIONAL THAT SHE MADE
IT ABOUT THAT, AND SHE FORGOT
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU
DO A TALK SHOW, LIKE
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.
- YEAH, IT PROBABLY COMES
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO BEING MORE
OF A NIGHT CLUB HOST WHERE
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION TO THE
AUDIENCE, YOU REALLY DON'T
CARE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.
HA HA HA!
- BUT THAT JUST TAKES A
LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE.
SHE'S GOT ALL THE IMPORTANT
INGREDIENTS TO DO THIS WELL IF
SHE WANTS TO DO
THIS PROFESSIONALLY.
- ALL RIGHT,
UP NEXT, JOSLYN FOX.
- THERE WAS NO ANIMAL
INTERPRETATION
IN THAT WHATSOEVER.
SHE STUCK SOME FEATHERS
ON HER HEAD AND...
- CALLED IT MACARONI.
- OK?
AND I DON'T GIVE
A FRIAR TUCK WHO YOU ARE.
YOU DON'T BE SHOWING
ME THAT WITH A MEATY TUCK
LIKE THAT.
- THAT WAS A MEATY TUCK.
- AS A TALK SHOW HOST, THE
BIGGEST THING WITH HER HOSTING
WAS HER LACK OF TACT,
ESPECIALLY
WITH SENSITIVE ISSUES.
- BUT WHAT I DO APPRECIATE
IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE DID
BRING THAT UP TO HER TODAY,
SHE WAS TEARFUL ABOUT IT,
AND I FELT THAT THAT
WAS VERY GENUINE OF HER.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
COURTNEY ACT.
- DO THE OTHER QUEENS JUST
SHIT BACKSTAGE WHEN SHE PUTS
ON WHAT SHE'S GONNA PUT
ON FOR THE RUNWAY?
BECAUSE THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE.
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
I THOUGHT SHE DID A GOOD JOB,
BUT THEN ONE MINUTE IN,
SHE JUST PLUMMETED ENERGY-WISE.
- I DIDN'T FEEL
THE ENERGY DIP, HONESTLY.
- NOR DID I.
- IT WAS CONVERSATIONAL.
IT JUST WORKED.
- I AGREE.
I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS
VERY, VERY LIKEABLE AND FUN.
- I WOULD SAY THAT HER
AND BENDELACREME WERE MY TWO
FAVORITE, JUST NECK AND NECK.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO TRINITY K. BONET.
- LOVED HER RUNWAY LOOK.
IT ALL WORKED TOGETHER.
- BUT IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO MAKE UP FOR HOW ABYSMAL HER
TALK SHOW WENT FOR HER.
- RIGHT.
WITH THE BIGGEST FAUX PAS
OF ALL, NOT KNOWING
THE GUEST'S NAME.
- HELLO, SHE CALLED HIM CHAD.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO RULE NUMBER ONE,
KNOW YOUR GUEST'S NAME.
- ALL RIGHT, SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU ARE SAFE.
BENDELACREME,
YOU ARE SAFE.
COURTNEY ACT, AS A TALK SHOW
HOST, YOU WERE UNFLAPPABLE,
AND ON THE MAIN STAGE,
YOU SOARED.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- YOU'VE WON A WIG WARDROBE
FROM OUTFITTERS WIG
AND A YEAR'S SUPPLY
OF HAIR CARE FROM AQUAGE.
- SECOND WIN.
- DARIENNE LAKE...
YOU ARE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO.
YOU, MY DEAR, ARE
ONE WILD CHILD,
BUT IN THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE,
YOU WERE EATEN ALIVE.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TRINITY K. BONET.
ON THE RUNWAY, YOU ARE
A FIERCE, FEATHERED FIREBIRD.
UNFORTUNATELY, ON THE TALK SHOW,
YOU LAID AN EGG.
JOSLYN FOX, YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE.
IN THE CHALLENGE, YOU PUT
YOUR HIGH-HEELED FOOT
IN YOUR MOUTH.
JOSLYN FOX...
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
TRINITY, I'M SORRY,
MY DEAR, BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
- I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN TRINITY SEND A LOT
OF BITCHES HOME WITH HER
LIP SYNC SINCE SHE TURNS IT
THE FUCK OUT.
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA FAINT.
- LADIES, PRIOR TO TONIGHT,
YOU WERE ASKED TO PREPARE
A LIP-SYNCH PERFORMANCE OF
VIBEOLOGY BY PAULA ABDUL.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO
IMPRESS ME AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

YOU'RE RESTING ON PRETTY.
DON'T BE A CLICHÉ, MY DEAR.
ADORE DELANO, YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- TRINITY K. BONET,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
MY DEAR MILK, SASHAY AWAY.
- OOH, THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.
- HOLY CRAP-OLA.
- OH, MILK.
- MILK IS GONE.
- AW.
- IT'S MILKIN' TIME.
- AW.
- POOR LECHE.
- I'M IN THE BOTTOM TWO AGAIN,
AND I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED.
IT'S HARD WHEN
SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES
ARE SOMETHING THAT
I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
AND SO MANY OF
THE GIRLS HERE ARE.
- CONGRATULATIONS TO MISS THING
ON HER FIRST BIG WIN.
- YEAH.
- YOU DESERVE IT.
- YOU DESERVE IT.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER.
- WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?
- YOU WERE IN THE TOP 3.
CONGRATULATIONS, MADAM.
- YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
- FINALLY.
- SHOWING YOUR SHIT LITERALLY.
- MUST BE JELLY.
- JAM DON'T SHAKE.
- I PURPOSEFULLY DIDN'T GET IN
THE TOP 3 ON THIS ONE
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
STAY ON MY FEET FOR AS LONG.
- AW.
- SOME OF DELA'S WINS HAVE
BOOSTED THE SIZE OF HER HEAD.
HOPEFULLY SHE DOESN'T TIP OVER.
- I WAS KIND OF LIKE
A BIT MIFFED AT RU
SAYING THAT I WAS
RELYING ON PRETTY,
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
GIVING A LOT OF PERFORMANCE
AND THEATRICS AND OTHER STUFF.
IS RU NOT SEEING
THAT I AM DOING MY BEST?
I MEAN, PERHAPS JUST MY PRETTY
WAS BLINDING HIM,
AND THAT'S ALL HE COULD SEE.
I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT PERFORMANCE IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOK.
- BUT THAT'S WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH MILK.
THEY DIDN'T BEAT MILK UP
AS MUCH FOR THE RAP,
BUT THEY BEAT HIM UP ABOUT
THE RUNWAY LOOK, AND MINE
WAS DEAD ON.
BUT ME AND MILK
WERE IN THE BOTTOM.
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK AT SOME
POINT THEY GET TIRED OF HEARING,
"WELL, THIS ISN'T MY THING.
MAYBE THE NEXT ONE"?
AND IT'S ALWAYS A SITUATION THAT
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH.
IS IT ALWAYS YOUR EXCUSE?
I MEAN, DO YOU NOT FEEL THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT'S ALL THAT I EVER HEAR.
- EVERY TIME
SHE'S IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES,
SHE GOES INTO
THIS LONG, DRAWN-OUT SPEECH
ABOUT HOW SHE TRIES
AND HOW THIS IS NOT HER THING.
I CAN BE SYMPATHETIC
TO A CERTAIN POINT.
IT JUST GETS OLD.
- IT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE ALREADY GOOD AT,
SO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.
- I'M NOT BEING NASTY ABOUT IT.
I JUST THINK THAT DOES HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
ARE YOU LISTENING?
I'M TRYING TO HELP TRINITY.
IF SHE DOESN'T CHANGE HER
ATTITUDE, SHE'S NOT GONNA
LAST LONG IN THIS COMPETITION.

BECAUSE OLDER CUCUMBERS
TEND TO GET BITTER.
- [LAUGHTER]
- NICE WORK, LADIES.
THE WINNER IS...
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
CONDRAGULATIONS.
THIS WEEK, THE MAIN CHALLENGE
IS PERSONAL.
I AM LAUNCHING
MY FIRST-EVER MAKEUP LINE...
RuPAUL RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION,
AND I'M ENTRUSTING EACH OF YOU
TO HELP ME MARKET IT.
I NEED YOU TO CREATE
30-SECOND COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGNS
THAT TARGET TODAY'S WOMAN.
YOU'LL BE WORKING IN PAIRS,
AND BECAUSE I OWN 51%
OF THIS DAMN COMPANY,
I'LL BE CASTING YOUR TEAMS.
- SO WE'RE GONNA BE PAIRED UP
WITH SOMEONE,
WHICH IS GOOD, I GUESS.
DEPENDS ON WHO IT IS.
- FIRST UP, ADORE AND LAGANJA.
YOU'LL BE MARKETING
TOWARD MEAN GIRLS,
SPOILED TEENAGERS
OBSESSED WITH BEAUTY
AND TEXTING AND TWEETING
AND TWERKING.
- SECRETLY I AM EXCITED
TO WORK WITH LAGANJA
BECAUSE WHEN
WE'RE NOT COMPETING,
WE'RE, LIKE, REALLY COOL, AND
SHE'S THE COOLEST BITCH EVER.
- AND BECAUSE LAGANJA
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
YOU GET EXTRA TIME ON SET.
- SICKENING.
- NEXT, COURTNEY AND JOSLYN.
YOUR TARGET IS HOT MAMAS.
- OOH.
- OOH.
- I IDOLIZED COURTNEY BEFORE
I CAME INTO THIS COMPETITION.
MEETING HER
WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,
SO GETTING TO WORK WITH HER
IS KIND OF SURREAL.
- NEXT, BIANCA AND TRINITY.
- DIDN'T I SAY TO THE UNIVERSE
THAT I DO NOT WANT TO WORK
WITH TRINITY AGAIN?
THANKS, RU, YOU SHADY BITCH.
- I'M ASSIGNING YOU
GLAMOROUS WORKING GIRLS,
FROM HOOKERS TO C.E.O.s.
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH BIANCA.
I JUST WANT TO WORK BY MYSELF.
I WANT A CHALLENGE WHERE
I COULD JUST THINK ON MY OWN.
- AND THAT LEAVES BENDELACREME
AND DARIENNE LAKE.
- REALLY? REALLY?
- YOU'LL TARGET THE COUGAR DEMO,
MATURE LADIES WHO ONLY GET
SEXIER WITH THE PASSING YEARS.
- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
BETWEEN DARIENNE AND I LATELY,
BUT I THINK THAT
SHE'S SUPER-TALENTED,
SO I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD PAIRING.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I JUST--
I'M JUST WRITING, LIKE,
STUPID LITTLE SHIT.
- OK.
- SOMETHING VERY BITCHY FOR
THE DEMOGRAPHIC KIND OF THING.
- RIGHT, LIKE THE MEAN GIRLS,
BUT, LIKE, RICH.
- RICH, BRATTY WHORES.
- ADORE AND I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
MANY TIMES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
I'M JUST REALLY NERVOUS
THAT ADORE WILL OVERSHADOW ME
AND THAT I WON'T BE THE STAR.
- "THIS SASSY, SEXY,
SICKENING PRODUCT..."
- [CHUCKLES]
MMM...
- WE COULD SAY,
"NOW THAT WE GOT OUR HANDS
ON THIS BITCHING MAKEUP..."
- [LAUGHS]
FUCK.
SO LAGANJA HAS IDEAS,
AND I MEAN, I WAS RAISED RIGHT,
SO ALL I CAN DO IS
NERVOUS LAUGH AT THEM
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO RESPOND TO THEM.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY, "NO, BITCH,
THAT'S AN AWFUL IDEA.
MINE IS BETTER."
BUT THAT WAS THE TRUTH
OF THE SITUATION.
- "ALL THE HOT BOYS WILL BE
KISSING THESE COATED LIPS,"
OR SOMETHING LIKE...
- UM...I DON'T KNOW.
I WANT TO BE MORE MEAN.
LIKE, "SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S MINE NOW."
- SO, LIKE, I'M PUTTING
ON THE LIP GLOSS,
LIKE, "I CAN SLEEP
WITH ANYONE I CHOOSE."
- SO I'M PICTURING US MAYBE
TO BE, LIKE, DRUNK LUSHES.
- OH, OK.
- YOU KNOW, LIKE...
- HAVE PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.
- YEAH, PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.
- OK, OK.
- I CANNOT EVEN WRAP MY BRAIN
AROUND IT AT THIS MOMENT
THAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS
THING WITH COURTNEY ACT HERSELF.
SHE HAS SO MUCH RESPECT FOR ME,
AND I, OF COURSE,
HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HER.
I THINK, LIKE, WE SHOULD
DO MAKEOVERS, LIKE IN DRAG.
- DOES ONE OF US WANT TO BE.
LIKE, A BEFORE,
AND ONE OF US WANT TO BE AFTER?
- IMAGINE IF YOU'RE THE BEFORE?
- BUT THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE
WOULD EVER BELIEVE THAT YOU
WERE THE AFTER, RIGHT?
[LAUGHS]
- COMING UP...
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL
YOUR WORKING GIRL?
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA,"
BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT BEFORE,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [LAUGHS]
[BELL DINGS]
- [LAUGHS]
- OK, GIRL, EVERY BITCH PROP
WE'VE EVER NEEDED--
DOGS, MAKEUP, CELL PHONE--
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO THEM.
- YELLS.
- TODAY OUR MAIN CHALLENGE
IS TO COME UP WITH A CONCEPT
AND SHOOT A 30-SECOND COMMERCIAL
FOR RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- WE'RE BUSY HERE.
- IS THIS THE GLAMAZON
SCHOOL OF MODELING?
- WHY, YES, IT IS.
- [LAUGHS]
DELA AND DARIENNE.
- HI.
- HI.
- YOU ALL ARE MARKETING TO?
- COUGARS.
- COUGARS.
- NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANY COUGARS?
- WE ARE COUGARS.
- I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY
TO BE A COUGAR.
- [LAUGHS]
SO...
- AND A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
COUGARS ARE DELUSIONAL.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU START,
'CAUSE WE HAVE
SOME OF THE NOTES HERE?
- OK.
- WE'RE DEFINITELY THINKING
SORT OF THAT--
OH, NO,
I'LL LET YOU START.
- "WHY DON'T YOU START?
UH!"
[LAUGHTER]
- SO HOW'S IT GOING
WORKING WITH DELA?
- WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AS MUCH
AS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CAN,
YOU KNOW, BUT, NO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WE'RE VERY MAGNETIC.
OPPOSITES DO ATTRACT, SO...
- SO ARE YOU OPPOSITES?
- I DON'T THINK WE ARE.
- I THINK WE HAVE DIFFERENT
WORKING STYLES, BUT, UM...
- ALL RIGHT.
SO TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN.
- WE'RE MARKETING
TO THE MODERN COUGAR
AND THE COUGAR'S BODY
AS A TEMPLE
THAT HAS PROBABLY UNDERGONE
SOME RENOVATIONS...
- SURE.
- BUT COULD USE
A FRESH COAT OF PAINT
TO COVER SOME OF
THE NEWLY REWORKED FOUNDATION.
- OK.
THIS PRODUCT IS VERY, VERY NEAR
AND DEAR TO MY HEART,
SO I WANT YOU TO RESPECT
THE PRODUCT.
- YEAH.
- I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE
IT'S GONNA TURN OUT FANTASTIC.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
JUST SELL MY MAKEUP.
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
HEY, TRINITY.
HEY, BIANCA.
- HI, HI, HI.
- SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SELL MY PRODUCT?
- I AM A C.E.O. WITH 4 CHILDREN,
AND SHE'S A HOOKER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I'M ON MY WAY TO A MEETING,
AND SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO A CUSTOMER.
- UH-HUH.
- AND AS I'M EXPLAINING THE
PRODUCT, SHE TELLS THE WORLD...
- "CHILD, I'M..."
"CHILD, I'M ON THESE STREETS
ALL NIGHT,
"AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT
I KEEP MY SASSY, SEXY LOOK UP.
"I USE MY RuPAUL--
I USE MY RuPAUL'S...
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION."
- YOU KNOW, THE JUDGES
HAVE CALLED YOU OUT ON
YOUR CONFIDENCE BEFORE.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
TURN THAT AROUND?
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA."
- I'M--I--I'M...
- BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT
BEFORE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.
- AM I THE FIRST PERSON
TO CALL YOU OUT ON THIS ISSUE
WITH PROJECTING
AND BEING MORE OUT THERE?
- THIS IS--IT'S HONESTLY
ALL NEW TO ME.
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THE WAY THAT I TALK
OR COMMUNICATION OR ANYTHING.
- BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST
THE WAY THAT YOU TALK.
IT'S A PROJECTION THING,
YOU KNOW.
I'M TRYING TO DRAG,
PUN INTENDED, YOURSELF OUT,
'CAUSE WHEN I SEE YOU LIP-SYNCH,
I SEE IT THERE.
IT'S THERE.
- EXACTLY.
- YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER
THAT EXACT SAME FIRE
INTO OTHER AREAS.
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT.
IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET THAT WALL DOWN.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO HELP DRAG IT OUT OF HER.
- I'M-A DO IT.
I'M-A DO IT.
WE'RE GONNA WORK IT OUT.
AND YOU GOT IT.
- GET BACK TO WORK.
- WE'LL DO IT.
WE'LL DO IT.
COME ON, WE CAN DO THIS.
SO ALL I'M DOING
IS ENCOURAGING THIS BITCH.
I KNOW SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO DO THESE CHALLENGES.
SHE JUST NEEDS TO APPLY HERSELF.
- LAGANJA AND ADORE.
- WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT
OUR COMMERCIAL
FOR RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- OUR MEAN TEAM GIRLS.
- AND I THINK WE LOOK
FUCKING COOL.
LIKE, IF WE WENT TO SCHOOL,
WE WOULD RULE THAT SCHOOL.
- SELL ME SOME COSMETICS.
- YES, GOD.
YOU KNOW, I MAY NOT BE
AS FUNNY AS ADORE.
HER PERSONALITY
REALLY DOES SHINE THROUGH.
I JUST REALLY WANT THE JUDGES
TO SEE
THAT I DO HAVE SOMETHING
SPECIAL AND UNIQUE.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES, ACTION.
- I KNOW ALL THE LOSERS
SITTING ALONE AT LUNCH RIGHT NOW
ARE FEELING SO MUCH SAFER.
- SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND IS MINE NOW.
- AND CUT.
LAGANJA, I'M WONDERING IF...
[IN VALLEY GIRL VOICE]
WE COULD JUST HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF,
YOU KNOW...
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, GOD.
- OH, LIKE MY RACHEL ZOE VOICE.
- NO.
[BELL DINGS]
- NOTHING CAN SATISFY OUR RICH
TASTES IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS.
- BUT NOW, THANKS TO RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION,
OUR FACES STAND OUT AMONGST THE
TROLLS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL HALL.
- OK, MOVING ON.
[BEEP]
- BLOW PICTURE.
OH, YEAH.
NOW, SPIN BACK TO CAMERA.
YES.
LOOK OVER THAT SHOULDER
AT THE CAMERA.
TOGETHER.
HA HA!
OK, ONE, TWO, THREE,
LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER.
- WE LOST AN EARRING.
- WORK TOGETHER.
TURN THE OTHER WAY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- CUT.
THAT'S A WRAP, LADIES.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON DOWN.
HOT MAMAS.
- WILL YOU BE OUR MAILMAN?
AND THIS IS YOUR PACKAGE.
- [LAUGHS]
SO YOU ARE
SOME STAY-AT-HOME MOMS
LOOKING FOR SOME GLAMOUR,
IS THAT RIGHT?
- WE'VE MODELED OUR CHARACTERS
ON THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF AMERICA.
- SO WHAT CITY
WOULD YOUR HOUSEWIVES BE FROM?
- GLAMAZONIA.
- [SNORTS]
- ALL RIGHT, ACTION.
- YOU KNOW, I WAS WATCHING
THAT "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT RuPAUL IS A MAN.
- I'VE BEEN WEARING RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
FOR MONTHS.
- OH.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
ON THE WAY.
- AND SO WHAT'S GONNA--
WHEN DOES THE MAILMAN COME IN?
- ALL RIGHT,
I WILL YELL "DING-DONG,"
AND WHOEVER'S HOUSE IT IS
IS GONNA SAY, "COME IN."
OK, READY?
- SURE.
- SURE.
- OK, AND ACTION.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE
A SPECIAL DELIVERY ON THE WAY.
- DING-DONG.
AND THEN YOU SAY...
- NICE PACKAGE.
- "COME IN."
- COME IN.
- NOW, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD BE SAYING "COME IN"
SINCE HE'S DELIVERING...
- WE KIND OF NAILED IT.

WITH A SEXY HIGH-GLOSS
LIP SHINE.
- [LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT, AND CUT.
[BEEP]
- CUT.
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO WRAP YOURS
IN A WAY WHERE JASON
CAN TAKE IT OFF EASIER.
[BEEP]
- YOUR HEAD'S GOTTEN BIGGER
SINCE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS.
- WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.
- [SIGHS]
- ACTION.
- WOW.
- OH, SHE'S GORGEOUS.
- [GASPS]
I WONDER HOW THEY GOT
THAT BEAUTIFUL.
- IT MUST BE THAT GLAMAZON.
- OH, YES.
- YES. CUT.
- OUR AD IS MORE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK
BUT DEFINITELY HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO SELL MAKEUP
TO SOME OTHER CRAZY DRAG QUEENS.
- HELLO.
- ALL RIGHT,
THESE ARE THE WORKING GIRLS.
- UH-HUH.
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
TRINITY STRUGGLES WITH
HER DELIVERY AND CONFIDENCE,
SO I'M FUCKING SCARED.
- ACTION.
- I AM THE C.E.O.
OF A MAJOR CORPORATION
AND THE MOTHER OF TWO,
AND I USE RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- CUT.
FANTASTIC.
WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING
WITH YOU, OK?
- YOU'VE GOT THIS, RIGHT, GIRL?
- I'M FUCKING PETRIFIED
BECAUSE RU AND MICHELLE
WILL BE DIRECTING ME TODAY,
AND I JUST DON'T SEEM TO DO WELL
WHEN THEY'RE SITTIN'
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
- ACTION.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
CLIENT FROM CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DO'S.
- JUMPING OUT OF CONDOS?
- CAR DO'S.
- CONDOS?
- NO, CAR DOORS.
- OK. CAR DO'S.
- I THINK I'M TRYING
TO JUST SAY IT FAST ENOUGH
'CAUSE YOU SAID 30 SECONDS.
- ALL RIGHT, BUT WE HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU, BABY.
- REMEMBER, TRINITY,
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, BITCH.
- BIANCA TOLD ME EARLIER,
"YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW."
I DECIDED THAT I WOULD JUST
CHANNEL MY INNER BIANCA
AND JUST BLURT IT ALL OUT
AND JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT,
'CAUSE IF NOT,
BIANCA GONNA KILL ME.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DOORS.
BUT WITH RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION...
- [LAUGHS]
- TRINITY DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB TODAY.
THANK GOD.
I JUST HOPE THAT IT'S
GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP US SAFE.
- THAT'S A WRAP, LADIES.
- IT'S TIME TO GET
BLACK AND WHITE.
- TODAY IS ELIMINATION DAY,
AND OUR RUNWAY THEME
IS BLACK AND WHITE.
- WHAT KIND OF RUNWAY LOOKS
ARE Y'ALL SERVING TODAY?
- I'M SERVING
SOME KLAUS NOMI REALNESS.
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK
FOR COURTNEY.
ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE
THAT JOSLYN...
- WITH HER LIGHT PURPLE...
- OH, JOSLYN.
JOSLYN AND I ARE SERVING,
LIKE, THE SAME...
- TUXEDO MENSWEAR.
- TUXEDO MENSWEAR LOOK.
- SO IF YOU TWO BOTH LANDED
IN THE BOTTOM TWO
PERFORMING AGAINST EACH OTHER
IN SIMILAR OUTFITS...
[GASPS]
OH, MY.
- JOSLYN WOULD GO HOME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- 'CAUSE SHE'S
A SECOND-RATE COURTNEY, YEAH.
- I THINK IT WAS LOW-RENT.
- SHADY.
- IT'S CLEAR THAT COURTNEY
DOES NOT SEE ME
AT THE SAME LEVEL AS HER.
THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT I IDOLIZE,
AND I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
- ON THAT NOTE...
- LET'S GET PRETTY THEN, OK?
- YEAH.
- COME ON, Y'ALL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- MY EYEBROWS.
- OH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHY YOU DOING IT
ALL IN MY HAIR-REA?
- UM...
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- DO YOU THINK THEY PAIRED US UP
'CAUSE THEY WERE KINDA LIKE,
"OH, DARIENNE, YOU GOT A BIG
BODY, AND BEN'S GOT A BIG HEAD."
- [LAUGHTER]
- YOU LOVE TO SAY THAT.
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S REALLY TRUE.
- NO, IT'S JUST BECAUSE
YOU MADE THAT COMMENT,
LIKE, AFTER--ABOUT
THE WHOLE WINNING TWICE,
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, OK."
- SHE TOLD ME SHE HATED YOU.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I REALLY FEEL
SOME PSYCHIC ENERGY
BETWEEN DELA AND DARIENNE.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOME TYPE OF TENSION
THAT YOU CAN CUT
WITH A CHEESE KNIFE.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, GIRL-LINA?
- I FEEL GOOD.
I THINK WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER.
- WE DID WORK WELL TOGETHER.
WE DIDN'T KILL EACH OTHER.
- [CHUCKLES]
- SO THAT WAS GOOD.
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T SEE
EYE-TO-EYE TO BEGIN WITH.
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU.
- RIGHT.
- I JUST FELT LIKE
YOUR PURPOSE HERE
WAS JUST TO COME HERE
AND BE EVIL AND MEAN.
- I APOLOGIZE IF I EVER
CAME ACROSS THAT WAY.
I WAS ANGRY WITH HER BECAUSE HER
WORK ETHIC AND HER ATTITUDE
WASN'T THE SAME AS MINE,
WHICH I LEARNED YOU CAN
STILL WORK WITH PEOPLE
IF THEY COME FROM
A DIFFERENT PLACE.
- IT'S NOT ONLY
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.
I'M LEARNING PATIENCE, BITCH.
- I'M ALSO OBVIOUSLY LEARNING
THAT I HAVE WAYS I GUESS
I NEED TO JUST WORK ON.
- I REALLY THINK TRINITY
HAS COME A LONG WAY,
AND SHE'S TOTALLY OPENED UP.
SHE SHOULD REALLY
BE PROUD OF HERSELF.
I'M PROUD OF HER.
- THIS IS HONESTLY
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME
I FEEL LIKE I'M WITH
A GROUP OF GIRLS
WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TIME OUT
TO UNDERSTAND ME...
- YEAH.
- AND BE PATIENT WITH ME.
I DEFINITELY AM COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU GIRLS.
- I AM GLAD, YOU STANK BITCH.
- AND I'M GLAD THAT THIS
IS MY SEASON 6 SISTERS...
- THERE YOU GO.
- AND IT'S GONNA BE...
- NOW, DON'T CALL ME COLLECT,
AND IF YOU GO TO JAIL, I KNOW

WELCOME, LADIES. IT'S TIME
TO DEBUT YOUR CAMPAIGNS.
FIRST UP, BIANCA DEL RIO
AND TRINITY K. BONET
TARGETING THE WORKING GIRL.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- I'M THE C.E.O.
OF A MAJOR CORPORATION
AND THE MOTHER OF TWO,
SO IN ORDER TO KEEP
MY SICKENING APPEARANCE,
I USE RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
I AM SO MUCH FINER WITH
THIS GLAMOROUS LIQUID LINER.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DOORS.
CAN'T EVEN KEEP MY LIPSTICK ON.
BUT WITH RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION...BAM!
WITH THIS GLOSS, I AM THE BOSS.
- SO WHETHER YOU'RE
A CORPORATE C.E.O...
- OR A PROFESSIONAL HO.
- YOU DESERVE A GLAMOROUS GLOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, GET BACK TO WORK, Y'ALL.
- OK.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE]
- SO HOW WAS IT
WORKING TOGETHER?
- MY GAY MOTHER PASSED AWAY,
LIKE, TWO YEARS AGO,
AND HER NAME WAS BIANCA, AND SHE
REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF MY MOTHER.
LIKE, JUST SHUT UP
AND DO WHAT I SAY.
- [LAUGHS]
- AND SHE JUST TOLD ME,
JUST EMBRACE ALL THE
OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE.
HAVE FUN WITH IT.
- WELL, THE RUNWAY--
I THINK YOU ARE BOTH EXQUISITE,
AND THE INFOMERCIAL WAS FUNNY.
I THOUGHT YOUR ACTING
WAS REALLY GOOD.
- WELL, TRINITY, TO ME,
MISSED THE BOAT
IN A PERFECT JOKE FOR YOU
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIP GLOSS ON.
YOU WERE SELLING WORKING GIRLS,
RIGHT?
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
IT'S GONNA STAY ON
AFTER YOU DO YOUR STUFF?
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
- SHE DIDN'T SAY IT SAY IT.
SHE SAID JUMPING
FROM CAR TO CAR...
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING IN CAR--
THIS COULD BE THIS.
- SHE HAS HER LIPSTICK ON
'CAUSE SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL HO.
- SO THE LIPSTICK
SHOULD STAY ON!
- SHE SAID IT LASTS
THROUGH ALL THAT.
- I WANT TO KNOW, DID IT STAY ON
THROUGH THE TRICK OR NOT?
- YES!
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THAT.
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
- YOU TWO MUST KNOW EACH OTHER.
- YES.
- YOU THINK?
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, LAGANJA
ESTRANJA AND ADORE DELANO
TARGETING MEAN TEEN GIRLS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- WE USED TO THINK WE HAD ALL
THE MAKEUP THAT MONEY COULD BUY.
- BUT NOW, THANKS TO RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION,
OUR FACES STAND OUT AMONGST THE
TROLLS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL HALLS.
- I KNOW ALL THE LOSERS SITTING
ALONE AT LUNCH RIGHT NOW
ARE FEELING SO MUCH SAFER
'CAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY
PAINTING OUR OWN FACES
INSTEAD OF THEIRS--
WITH THIS LONG-LASTING MASCARA,
OF COURSE.
SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND IS NOW MINE.
HE JUST CAN'T RESIST
THIS VITAMIN-INFUSED LIP GLOSS.
BECAUSE WHOEVER SAID BEAUTY
WAS ON THE INSIDE...
- IS UGLY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I THINK YOU SOLD IT.
IT WAS SHOCKINGLY IRREVERENT
BUT ASPIRATIONAL.
- I WANT TO BUY THE PRODUCT, AND
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
- I THINK YOUR COSTUME--
IT'S A LITTLE TACKY LOOKING.
- YOUR HAIR IS UNEVEN.
IT'S FLOPPING, AND THE CROTCH
IS A LITTLE LOW FOR ME.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY
YOU LOOK, ADORE.
- YAY.
- YOUR WAIST IS CINCHED.
YOU HAVE LEGS.
YOU'RE NOT CUTTING THEM OFF.
LET'S, LIKE, SAVOR THIS MOMENT.
- I'M A REAL DRAG QUEEN.
- YES. HA HA!

NEWLY LIFTED LID.

ACCENTUATE CHEEKBONES

A P.S.A. FOR PLASTIC SURGERY.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT EITHER
SURGERY OR DRUGS.

- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DEFINITELY STONED.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BENDELA, MY ISSUE IS
I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME WE'RE
HIDING BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE,
AND I WANT TO GET TO KNOW MORE
OF WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON.
- NEXT UP,
COURTNEY ACT AND JOSLYN FOX
TARGETING STAY-AT-HOME
HOT MAMAS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- I WAS WATCHING
THAT "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
THAT RuPAUL IS A MAN.
- OH, YOU STUPID BITCH,
OF COURSE RuPAUL IS A MAN.
AND I'VE BEEN WEARING RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
FOR MONTHS.
- OH.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
ON THE WAY.
[DOORBELL DINGS]
- COME IN.
NICE PACKAGE.
- AND THE MAKEUP
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD EITHER.
- [LAUGHS]
IF IT CAN MAKE A MAN LIKE RuPAUL
LOOK LIKE A GLAMAZON...
- IMAGINE WHAT IT CAN DO FOR
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM LIKE YOU...
OR US.
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WORKING TOGETHER?
- WE'VE GOT, LIKE,
A LITTLE SISTER VIBE GOING.
SHE'S THE LITTLE SISTER.
- I'M THE LOW-RENT VERSION
OF COURTNEY, SO SHE SAYS.
- I MAY HAVE USED
THAT TERM ONCE.
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
WAS MAKEUP UNTIL THE END.
- BUT, COURTNEY, TONIGHT
I THINK THIS KLAUS NOMI
COCKTAIL WAITRESS LOOK
IS AMAZING.
IT'S GORGEOUS.
- UH, JOSLYN, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU JUST WORE THIS IN BLUE,
AND WE JUST TOLD YOU
THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON,
AND NOW YOU WORE IT AGAIN.
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND,
THE HAIRLINE--IT'S, BOY.
- I COULD GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT THE HAIR.
I WAS MESMERIZED BY THE ASS.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US AD EXECUTIVES,
WHAT'D YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH LAGANJA
ESTRANJA AND ADORE DELANO.
- I THINK AS A GROUP LAGANJA AND
ADORE HAD THE BEST AD FOR ME.
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
THEY SOLD THE MAKEUP PRODUCT.
- WHILE BEING BULLIES.
- BUT THAT WAS THEIR CHARACTER,
MICHELLE.
- BUT--YEAH, IT'S PUSHED SO FAR
THAT IT'S FUNNY.
- BUT WITH THAT SAID,
I THINK ADORE WAS
THE STRONGER ONE OF THE TWO
AND PULLED LAGANJA THROUGH.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO
AND TRINITY K. BONET-NAY.
- I THINK ON THE RUNWAY,
THEY WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEST.
- AS FAR AS THE INFOMERCIAL
GOES, THEY GOT THE JOB DONE.
I FEEL LIKE WE SAW
A SIDE OF TRINITY
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE.
WE GOT TO SEE TRINITY SPEAKING
UP AND REALLY ENJOYING IT,
AND THAT WAS REFRESHING.
- NOT MY FAVORITE AD.
THE BEFORE AND AFTERS--
IT WASN'T THAT BIG
OF A TRANSFORMATION FOR ME.
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
UNTIL THIS MOMENT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BENDELACREME AND DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, THE COMMERCIAL--
I MEAN, IT WAS A VERY STRANGE
ATTACK ON THE PRODUCT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- VERY STRANGE ATTACK ON THE...
- IN FACT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE PRODUCT WAS, YOU KNOW?
IT WAS A BUTCHERING.
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE SELLING MAKEUP.
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
ALL ABOUT THE SURGERY.
THE FACES THEY WERE PULLING
WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL.
WE LOVE THOSE FACES,
BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO SELL COSMETICS.
- TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
I DID NOT FANCY BENDELACREME.
- THE HAIR LOOKED LIKE A PENIS
WRAPPED IN A BANDAGE.
-  [LAUGHTER]
- IT WAS VERY WEIRD.
- AND I DO NOT KNOW WHO DELA IS
AT ALL EXCEPT A COSTUME QUEEN.
I FEEL LIKE TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT PERSON
IS UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT COURTNEY ACT
AND JOSLYN FOX.
- COURTNEY WAS REALLY FUN
ON THE RUNWAY TONIGHT.
I LOVE THE LOOK SHE WAS GIVING.
JOSLYN--I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE...
- BUT I THINK YOU CAN BELIEVE
SHE WOULD WEAR THAT.
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S TRUE.
- AREN'T YOU FROM SOUTH
PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY?
- HOLLA.
- [LAUGHS]
- THE POINT, IS YOU JUST WORE
WHAT YOU WORE LAST WEEK
AFTER WE SO HARSHLY CRITIQUED
YOU, IN ANOTHER COLOR?
AND THEN PUT YOUR BOY HAIR ON?
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
WHEN PEOPLE GET CHARACTERS
LIKE STAY-AT-HOME MOM,
THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANS THAT
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY MATRONLY.
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.
- NO, THEY DIDN'T.
- THEY DIDN'T OVERDO IT.
- I THOUGHT COURTNEY
WAS SO, LIKE, DUMBED DOWN.
- SHE WAS DRAB.
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.
- WELL, SHE DOES
THIS REALNESS THING.
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS DOING
IN THE COMMERCIAL.
- RIGHT.
- I DON'T WANT REAL.
I WANT A DRAG QUEEN.
- OK, BUT THAT
WASN'T THEIR COMMERCIAL!
- [LAUGHS]
- JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH,
AM I ON ANOTHER SHOW?
- NOW, LEAH, YOU LIKE THIS AD.
TELL US WHY.
- I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.
- [LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GLAMAZONS.
[ENGINE REVS]

AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I STILL HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND.

WAS CUTE, BUT "KEEP IT FOXY,"
THAT WAS HOT.

TO SIT FRONT ROW
AT A BIANCA DEL RIO COMEDY SHOW,
BECAUSE SHE'S COMING FOR YOU

MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SHARON.

WHAT HALF THESE CHALLENGES
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING,
BUT I AM SO ENTERTAINED.
- I MIGHT FART ON YOUR STOMACH.

IN HERE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD'VE MADE IT BETTER?
IS IF THE PURSE ROLLED IN
AND THEN STOPPED,
AND THEN SHE GOT OUT OF IT,
AND THEN PICKED IT UP
AND WALKED OUT,
BECAUSE IT WAS BIG ENOUGH.

IT IS A KNOWN FACT
THAT A WOMAN DO CARRY
AN EVENING BAG
AT A DINNER PARTY.
NUMBER 3.
- OH, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
WITH THE YELLOW IN THE UMBRELLA
AND THE BLUE,
THAT WAS GORGEOUS.
SHE LOOKED STUNNING.
- IF YOU CAN JUST WALK AROUND
WITH YOUR OWN SPECIAL EFFECTS,
AND JUST HAVE RAIN FALLING
ON YOU, LIKE, IT'S GREAT.
- THIS RUNWAY LOOK
WAS A LITTLE MISLEADING, THOUGH,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HER NAME
SHOULD HAVE BEEN APRIL SHOWERS.
- MAKE IT RAIN, GIRL.
MAKE IT RAIN.
NUMBER 2.
- COURTNEY'S CHARACTER
IN THE RUSICAL
GOT ADDICTED TO FISH OIL.
I DIDN'T KNOW

A LOT FROM ORNACIA.
I'M SHOCKED SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT
INTO THE FINAL 3.
- OH, BOY!
- ORNACIA MEAN MUGS THE CAMERA.
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- UH-HUH.
- BACK IN NEW YORK CITY, I USED
TO GO CLUBBING WITH ORNACIA
ALL THE TIME.
WE'RE ON THE LIST,
ORNACIA PLUS ONE.
I LOVE THIS SONG,
ORNACIA, DON'T YOU?
OH, MY GOD, THIS DJ

OF THE SHOW REALLY MADE ME WET.
IN THE EYE.
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER.
PERVERT.
THE TOP 5 MOMENTS
THAT MADE US FEEL THINGS.
NUMBER 5.
- THANK YOU.
- MILK GOT REALLY CHOKED UP
WHEN SHE LEFT.
- I JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALLOWING ME
TO BE WHO I AM
WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING RIDICULED.
- MILK GETS ELIMINATED,
AND IT'S SUCH A SHAME,
THE ONE TIME
SHE LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN,
AND SHE GETS SENT HOME,
WHAT THE HELL?
- IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF
AND ARE HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE WORLD,
THEN NO ONE
CAN FAULT YOU FOR THAT.
- I HAD TO CUT MILK
OUT OF MY DIET
AND I WASN'T READY.
I'M NOT READY FOR SOY.

- THE 5 Gs: GOOD GOD,
GANJA, GET A GRIP.

YOU BROKE ME DOWN,
I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
I LOOK STUPID.
GOD, THIS FUCKING SUCKS.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK
ALL THE TIME TO EPISODE 8
FOR PEOPLE TO TELL LAGANJA
THAT HER VOICE WAS ANNOYING.
COME ON! OKAY?
- THAT'S NOT FAIR, I'M SORRY,
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VOICES,
YOU KNOW?
I'VE BEEN TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE
MY VOICE WAS ANNOYING,
AND, YOU KNOW, NOW,
IT'S HOW I MAKE MY MONEYS.
- WORK, BITCH.
- NUMBER 2.
- I AM HIV POSITIVE.
I WANTED TO COME ON THIS SHOW,
AND I WANTED TO BE
THAT VOICE FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE SCARED

WHICH I THINK
IS EXTREMELY BRAVE.
- I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU.
YOU TOLD ME
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
"I'M GOING TO BE A STAR,
I'M GOING TO BE ON TV."
SO HERE WE ARE.
- THE FACT
THAT TRINITY K. BONET'S MOTHER
SENT THAT BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE
AND THE FACT
THAT SHE JUST SEEMED,
LIKE, SO TEAM TRINITY,
I LOVE THAT.
I THINK ALL MOTHERS
SHOULD BE THAT OPEN
AND LOVING TO THEIR KIDS.
IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE.
- NUMBER 1.
HERE COMES THE BRIDE.
- [FAKE CRYING]
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND SOME PEOPLE
SHED REAL TEARS.
- I BELIEVE
EVERY LIVING CREATURE
IN THE UNIVERSE
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO LOVE
AND TO BE HAPPY.
AND I'M FINALLY GOING HOME
TO PLAN MY OWN WEDDING, FINALLY.
[SIGHS]
- THAT'S CUTE. LITTLE
MISS JOSLYN'S ALL EMOTIONAL,
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO MAKE OVER
THESE WEDDING COUPLES,
AND SHE'S ENGAGED.
THAT'S SPECIAL.
I KNOW I BETTER
HAVE AN INVITATION.
- GUESS WHO CAUGHT THE BOUQUET.
THANKS, BRANDONNA.
[LAUGHS]
SMELLS ROTTEN.
A MOMENT YOU DIDN'T SEE
THIS SEASON
CAME
DURING THE TALK SHOW CHALLENGE.
WE SURPRISED EACH OF THE QUEENS
WITH A MYSTERY GUEST
AND THINGS GOT A LITTLE WILD.
- IT'S FINALLY THAT TIME
TO REVEAL
OUR SPECIAL MYSTERY GUEST.

YES, BITCH.
- I THOUGHT THAT COURTNEY
WAS ACTUALLY GOING
TO TAKE FLIGHT
OFF THE STAGE
AND TAKE MICHELLE VISAGE'S
LACE FRONT WITH HER.
- THAT'S IT? THAT'S EVERYTHING?
YOU'VE LOOKED
AT THE EDITING FLOOR

DEL NERO IN THAT LIGHT.

WATCHING BIANCA DEL NERO'S PAST.
- DEL RIO?

YOU'VE SAID--
DEL NERO.

NUMBER 1. "DRAG RACE"
SUPER FAN KHLOE KARDASHIAN.
- KHLOE KARDASHIAN

THE HONEY BADGER OF DRAG.
SHE DOESN'T CARE.
- BASIC BITCHES NOT WANTED.
I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE.
I'M A BIG GIRL.
- I LOVE ANYBODY'S WHO'S GOT
A LARGE AND IN-CHARGE PUSS.
- HASHTAG NO FILTER.
- NOW, DURING KHLOE KARDASHIAN'S
SECOND APPEARANCE THIS SEASON,
SHE PERFORMED ON THE MAIN STAGE
WITH RAVEN AND MANILA.
THE SEQUENCE WAS SUPPOSED TO AIR
ON "KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS,"
SO THIS FOOTAGE IS SO EXCLUSIVE,
IT GOT CUT FROM NOT JUST ONE,
BUT TWO SHOWS.
LOOK AT THAT BODY,
MY GOD, IT'S GORGEOUS.
- WHICH ONE? ME? OH.
- YOUR PADS ARE AMAZING.
- [LAUGHS]

NUMBER 5.
- BITCH, ANYBODY THAT COMES
DOWN THE RUNWAY
LOOKING LIKE THAT,
THINKING THAT THE TONY AWARDS,
I WANT TO GET INTO YOUR BRAIN,
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- GIA IS VERY ONE-SIDED
WITH HER IDEA OF DRAG.
I COULD GO OFF
ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS
THAT SHE NEEDS TO FIX,
BUT I'D RATHER NOT.
- GIA'S DRAG IS ALL
ABOUT BEING FISHY,
GIVING THE ILLUSION OF A WOMAN,
AND MILK'S DRAG
IS KIND OF OPPOSITE THAT.
- I LOVE MILK'S DRAG.
I THINK THERE'S
AN AUTHENTICITY TO IT.
IT'S JUST HIS OWN PARTICULAR
THING, AND I LIVE.
I COMPLETELY LIVE FOR MILK.
- JUST GOT OFF THE BOAT,
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE TRIP FROM ASIA.

VERSION OF COURTNEY ACT,

[LAUGHTER]
- SOMETIMES IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOUR IDOL,
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.
- YOUR DRAG ISN'T AS POLISHED
AS OTHER DRAG
IN THE COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT BEING MEAN.
I'M JUST BEING FACTUAL,
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IN ANY WAY TO HURT HER FEELINGS.
- IT WAS VERY BIG SISTER,
LITTLE SISTER, YOU KNOW?
THE LITTLE SISTER
IDOLIZING THE BIG SISTER,
AND THEN SHE WAKES UP
AND REALIZES THAT IT'S A MAN.
[LAUGHS]
- I'VE GOT MY LACE FRONT
GLUED DOWN.
I DO GLANCE OVER
AND NOTICE JOSLYN
GIVING A LITTLE SIDEBURN ACTION.
WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER
INTO A NICE LACE FRONT WIG.
- NUMBER 3.
- YOU WON A CHALLENGE.
- I WON THE FIRST CHALLENGE TOO.
- OH YOU DID? OH.
- I DID.
- I WASN'T THERE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.
- HONEY,
I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON,
SO I DIDN'T SEE THE ULTIMATE
SHADE SHOWDOWN COMING.
- WHY DID DARIENNE HATE
BEN SO MUCH?
- DARIENNE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE ME?
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
- OOH!
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT INTIMIDATES A GIRL MORE,
THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD
AT THE THINGS
THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT,
OR THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD
AT THE THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT.
- I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY
TO BE A COUGAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- AND A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
COUGARS ARE DELUSIONAL.
- DARIENNE DOES NOT LIKE DELA,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
- I'M NOT A MONSTER.
- NUMBER 2.
- I DO FEEL A LITTLE BIT SHAFTED
BY YOU TODAY.
- WHEN?
- I DON'T REMEMBER
THE EXACT COMMENT YOU SAID.
- WHAT DID SHE SAY, LAGANJA?
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.
- I TRIED
TO FIGURE IT OUT, LIKE,
WHAT IT IS I THOUGHT YOU SAID,
AND I THINK IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST REALLY EMOTIONAL
AND DISTRAUGHT AND ALREADY DOWN.
- BUT I FELT LIKE AT ONE POINT,
MAYBE EARLIER,
OR MAYBE YESTERDAY,
THAT POSSIBLY THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ADORE AND LAGANJA,
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER,
BUT I'M SORRY.
- NUMBER 1.
- FUCK THESE BITCHES.
ARE YOU IN A WHITESNAKE VIDEO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?
- SHE MOUTHED OFF
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE.
- I WILL SHOW YOU VERSATILITY
WHEN SANTINO
WINS A SEWING COMPETITION
AND VISAGE
WEARS A FUCKING TURTLENECK.
- AND THEN I LOVE THE FACT
THAT SHE THROWS THE TRUTH
BACK IN THEIR FACE.
- I'M MORE OF A BEYONCE MYSELF.
- AT LEAST BEYONCE'S DRESSES
HIT THE FLOOR.
- NOW, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.
BIANCA'S NOT A BITCH,
SHE'S RIGHT.
- WE'RE DRAG QUEENS
IN A FUCKING COMPETITION.
THE ONLY THING WORSE
IS FUCKING PRISON.
- NOW, LIKE TRUE SISTERS,
MY GIRLS ARE ALWAYS THERE
TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP.
LET'S COUNT DOWN THIS SEASON'S
TOP 3 SUPPORT HO'S.
NUMBER 3.
- WHEN EVERYBODY WAS BAGGING
ON MILK FOR HER LOOK,
JOSLYN WAS THE ONLY ONE
TO STICK UP FOR HER.
- YOU'RE IGNORANT.
I'M SORRY, IT'S IGNORANCE.
- OH, IGNORANT NOW.
- YES.
- OKAY, WELL, IGNORANT
WOULD BE ME NOT WANTING
TO BETTER EDUCATE MYSELF.
- WELL, EDUCATE YOURSELF.
- AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HER
WHAT SHE THINKS.
- NO, YOU'RE READING HER.
- OF COURSE,
WHEN A PERSON'S IGNORANT,
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
[LAUGHS]
SO SHE GOT ALL BENT
OUT OF SHAPE,
AND IT WAS THE TRUTH.
- I'M NOT EDUCATED?
YOU LOOK
LIKE A FUCKING RECYCLING BIN.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- NUMBER 2.
YOU ARE BENDELACREME,
AND THAT'S THE CHARACTER
THAT YOU HAVE BUILT,
AND DON'T YOU CHANGE IT
FOR NOBODY.
- WHEN HER SISTERS
WERE FEELING DOWN
AFTER A ROUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE,
IT WAS NICE TO SEE
THAT TRINITY WAS ABLE
TO GO AROUND AND GIVE THEM
A LITTLE PEP TALK, YOU KNOW?
- DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP
OR FEEL BAD
BECAUSE COURTNEY,
YOUR COMPETITOR,
TOLD YOU
THAT YOUR LOOK IS NOT POLISHED.
- SHE WAS GIVING THEM A PEP TALK
LIKE SHE WAS A COACH
IN THE SUPER BOWL OR SOMETHING.
- EXACTLY.
- DID BEYONCE PERFORM
AT THE SUPER BOWL?
SHE WASN'T THE COACH, RIGHT?
[LAUGHS]
- NUMBER 1.
- REMEMBER, TRINITY,
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, BITCH.
- BIANCA HAS A SOFT SIDE,
AND SHE HELPS THE GIRLS.
- I THINK THAT BIANCA IS
ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE PERSON.
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY
A VERY SENSITIVE PERSON,
I'M IMAGINING.
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.
- I'M DOWN.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.
- SECRETLY, SHE ALLOWED ADORE
TO BORROW ONE OF HER CORSETS
IN FRONT OF 9 CAMERAS.
WAY TO PLAY THE GAME, BITCH.
- COMING UP, LEGENDARY QUEENS
GIVE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE TOP 3.
- FOR SUCH A VICIOUS BITCH,
SHE SHO IS PURTY.
- CALM DOWN, BEYONCE.
- AND THE PIT CREW
SISSY THAT WALK.
- AY, DIOS MIO.
- AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.
- OKAY?
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."
WITH JUST ONE WEEK
UNTIL WE CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME.
- PREGNANT PAUSE,
PREGNANT PAUSE.
- THE TIME HAS COME
TO SCHOOL THE CHILDREN
ON THE ABCs.
LEARN IT, AND LEARN IT WELL.
- FUCK YEAH, I'M THE FIRST ONE!
- A YOUNG QUEEN BURSTING
WITH RAW TALENT,
AND THE ABILITY TO CHARM
HER WAY OUT OF...ANYTHING?
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT,
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,
AND I WANTED TO SHOW MY BODY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE HAS BABY JESUS EYES.
SHE JUST...
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE HER.
- I LOVE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE,
"MY DRESS DOESN'T HIT THE FLOOR,
AND I LOOK FUCKING COOL."
- YOU KNOW,
I LOVE THAT SHE'S GOT
A LITTLE BIT
OF MESSINESS TO HER.
I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT
UNDER THE ACRYLIC FINGERNAILS
IS KIND OF HOT SOMETIMES.
- I'M FUCKING HOOD.
I'M FROM AZUSA.
I'LL STAB A BITCH.
[LAUGHS]
- SHE TAKES THE CRITIQUES,
SHE TRIES TO GROW FROM THEM,
BUT SHE'S STILL LOVING IT.
- SHE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH WITH RU
IN THE WALKTHROUGH.
- I CAME HERE TO BE TOP 3,
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.
- YOU CAN TASTE
THAT SHE REALLY WANTED IT.
- OOH, GIRL, BITCH BROUGHT IT
FOR THE VIDEO SHOOT.
- HER SISSY
WAS SISSYING MY WALK.
SHE WAS GIVING ME SISSY SPACEK.
- SHE'S EAGER, SHE'S READY,
AND SHE SINGS.
- OH, AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE.
- OH, SHIT, SHE'S GOING
TO TAKE MY GIGS. I HATE HER.
- PARTY.
- ADORE MAY HAVE STARTED
WITH A WHIMPER,
BUT SHE ENDED WITH A BIG BANG.
WILL THIS FALLEN IDOL CONTINUE
HER RISE TO THE TIPPITY TOP?
- NOT TODAY, SATAN. NOT TODAY.
- BIANCA DEL RIO WAS
THIS SEASON'S MOUTH THAT ROARED.
- THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES.
- SHE'S A KILLER COMEDIAN,
A SEASONED QUEEN,
AND A DAMN SEAMSTRESS.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.
- THAT DRESS IS GORGEOUS.
- YOU CAN BORROW THIS ONE TOO.
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU, GIRL.
- NOT ONLY CAN SHE CUT
A DRESS PATTERN,
BUT SHE CAN CUT YOU TO FILTH.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT YOUR MAMA.
MY NAME IS BIANCA.
- NOTHING GETS PAST BIANCA,
AND I LOVE THAT.
- AND I GOT TO THINKING
THAT IT WAS A CROCK OF SHIT.
- SHE'S THE BITCH
THAT I AGREE WITH.
- SHE KEEPS IT SO REAL,
AND EVERYTHING
THAT COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH
IS JUST ALL BRILLIANCE
ALL THE TIME.
- SHE'S A MAN WITH ONE EYE.
- AT THE BEAT OF HER EYELASH,
SHE COULD DROP
A FREAKING ONE-LINER.
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?
- WELL,
THEY'RE ALL HELPING ME OUT
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I WAS PRETTY FLABBERGASTED
HOW SWEET BIANCA HAS TURNED OUT.
SHE'S ACTUALLY HELPED PEOPLE
DO THEIR MAKE-UP,
CINCHED THEIR BODY,
AND REACHED OUT
IN A TIME OF NEED.
- IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
CALL A HATEFUL BITCH LIKE ME.
- BUT IS SHE REALLY HELPING?
YOU NEVER KNOW.
THIS IS A COMPETITION, GIRLS.
- COME ON, SHAKE IT OFF.
SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF.
PRETEND IT'S GAS.
JUST LEAVE IT IN THE HALLWAY.
- BIANCA DEL RIO
IS A TAKE-NO-PRISONERS
PROFESSIONAL BITCH
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.
- YOU ALWAYS END
WITH A NASTY COMMENT.
- I ALWAYS BEGIN WITH ONE TOO!
- SHE'S A CUTTHROAT CONTENDER
FOR THE CROWN,
BUT SHE'S NOT ALONE.
- IS THIS "AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL"?
- ENTER COURTNEY ACT.
- I HONESTLY WANT TO JUST SKIN
YOU ALIVE AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
- A PROVEN SINGER AND SUPERSTAR
FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT CAUGHT
OUR ATTENTION FROM DAY ONE.
- [SQUAWKS]
- [LAUGHS]
- OH, IF PRETTY HURTS,
COURTNEY IS MURDERING US.
- EVERY TIME SHE WALKS DOWN
THE RUNWAY, I'M LIKE,
"WHO LET THAT GIRL IN HERE?
CAN SOMEONE CALL SECURITY?
"THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN
WALKING AROUND
THE MAIN STAGE."
- SUCH A SHAME ABOUT THAT BODY.
I KNOW SHE WISHES SHE HAD
MY CURVES AND SWERVES, BABY.
- THE ONLY THING WRONG
I WOULD SAY IS, YOU'RE PERFECT.
- WELL, EVERYONE ELSE
IS RELYING ON UGLY.
WHY CAN'T I RELY ON PRETTY?
- [LAUGHTER]
- SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.
- ♪ I DON'T DRINK
OR EAT OR CUSS ♪
- I HATE THAT.
- JUST WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO HATE COURTNEY,
SHE DOES SOMETHING NICE.
YOU SHADY LITTLE BITCH.
- YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF
A NICE MAN
LOOKING JUST LIKE THAT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRDLY PROPORTIONED BODY.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DO,
AND SO WHAT?
- COURTNEY HAS STAR QUALITY
WRITTEN ALL OVER HER.
- WOULDN'T IT BE SO EXCITING
TO HAVE AN AUSTRALIAN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- WILL THIS AUSSIE IMPORT
PULL AHEAD
AND LEAVE THESE DOMESTIC MODELS
IN HER DUST?
- COURTNEY DEFINITELY
HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR, BUT I--
- BIANCA SHOULD WIN.
- I LIKE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S 22, AND SHE'S--
- SILENCE.
I HAVE NOT MADE MY DECISION.
SO WHOSE TEAM
ARE YOU PLAYING FOR?
TEAM ADORE DELANO,
TEAM BIANCA DEL RIO,
OR TEAM COURTNEY ACT?
HASHTAG IT AND TELL THE WORLD
WHO YOU THINK SHOULD BE CROWNED
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- COULD WE JUST
CROWN THIS BITCH ALREADY?
- UP NEXT,
MY GIRLS GO BLINDLY
WHERE NO QUEENS
HAVE GONE BEFORE.
- OKAY.
- PLUS, THE WORLD VIDEO PREMIERE
OF "SISSY THAT WALK"
WHEN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.
[LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."
ADORE DELANO, BIANCA DEL RIO,
COURTNEY ACT,
WHO DO YOU THINK
HAS THE BIGGEST CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE, AND TALENT?
STARTING NOW,
YOU'VE GOT ONE WEEK
TO LET ME AND THE WORLD KNOW.
RIGHT, GIRLS?
- YES, GOD.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- DON'T WEAR BACON.
- THIS SEASON,
I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED
FOR PROMOTING
TOO MANY OF MY PRODUCTS,
SO, TONIGHT
I WILL NOT BE PLUGGING
MY NUMBER ONE ALBUM
"BORN NAKED."
I WILL MAKE NO MENTION
OF MY SIGNATURE FRAGRANCE
RUPAUL'S GLAMAZON.
AND MY FINAL VOW, YOU WILL NOT
HEAR A PEEP OUT OF ME
ABOUT THE NEW RUPAUL CANDY BAR.
NOT A PEEP. I WON'T MENTION IT,
EVEN THOUGH IT IS MADE
WITH DELICIOUS MILK CHOCOLATE,
SEA SALT, AND...

FOR "SISSY THAT WALK."
AND NEXT WEEK,
JOIN ME AND ALL MY GIRLS
FOR
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED."
- OKAY.
- NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL
YOU GON' LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A CHOCOLATE BAR
UP IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- HALLELOO.
- AMEN.
- LET THE MUSIC VIDEO PLAY.

- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE..."
THE HOUSE OF RU PAUL
IS THROWING THE FIRST-EVER
GLITTER BALL!
- I JUST GET REALLY,
LIKE, DISCOURAGED
AND, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
- WHY IS IT YOU HAVEN'T
WON MORE CHALLENGES?
- NOW I'M STARTING
ALL OVER.
I'M FUCKED.
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
GONNA RUN ANY BUSINESS
DRESSED LIKE THAT.
IT WAS A COCKTAIL DRESS.
- ADORE DELANO...
CONDRAGULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- OH, MY GOD.
DARIENNE LAKE,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
DE LA, SASHAY AWAY.
[LOUD SIGH]
- OH, MY GOD. OOH.
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT ON THE MIRROR?
- JESUS! DARIENNE
IS SPELLED INCORRECTLY.
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- "I ONLY HARBOR
ENOUGH RESENTMENT
"TO WRITE A LONG,
POINTLESS MESSAGE
THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO CLEAN
AND CLEAN AND CLEAN AND CLEAN."
- I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA MISS DE LA.
[MUMBLES]
NO, I WON'T. I WON'T.
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
MISS ADORE.
- YOU WON
A SEWING CHALLENGE.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, YEAH.
- ARE THEY SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING?
SHE WAS JUST WEARING
A WHITE TUTU
WITH A CORSET
AND SOME SPARKLES ON IT.
- YOU DID GREAT.
- WELL, APPARENTLY ADORE
IS THE PERFECT BANJEE GIRL.
- TONIGHT, COURTNEY KIND OF
THREW ME UNDER THE MAT.
- OVER THE LAST
FEW WEEKS,
ADORE KIND OF TRIPPED
AND STUMBLED.
SO I THINK THAT SHE WOULD BE
THE NEXT ONE TO GO.
- I REALLY
DON'T SEE THE POINT
WHY COURTNEY THREW
MY NAME OUT THERE.
THE QUESTION WAS WHO DO YOU
THINK SHOULD GO HOME,
NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT
WAS GOING TO
BUT IT TURNED IT
THE FUCK OUT.
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE JUDGES ARE GONNA THINK.
- NO, YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW.
THEY WANT MORE,
BUT THEN THEY WANT--
MY RUFFLE'S TOO BIG,
AND MY HAT'S TOO MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW.
- IF I AM BRUTALLY HONEST...
- SURE.
BE BRUTALLY HONEST.
- I KIND OF WAS THINKING
THAT YOU WOULD TURN OUT
SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T SEEN.
- NOT TODAY, SATAN.
NOT TODAY.
HEY, I'M STILL HERE.
I'M GRATEFUL.
- BIANCA IS
A LITTLE RATTLED.
MAYBE I'M STARTING TO SEE
A COUPLE OF CRACKS IN THE WALL.
I HOPE SO.
- PARTY.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
- THE WINNER
OF "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE
OF $100,000.
- ♪ "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE" ♪
♪ MAY THE BEST WOMAN,
BEST WOMAN WIN ♪
- FOUR!
- HOW COOL!
- I'M SO EXCITED
TO BE IN THE TOP FOUR.
I'M SO CLOSE
TO THE FINISH LINE,
AND YOU COULD GRAB IT,
OR IT COULD JUST SLIP AWAY.
SO I'M GONNA GRAB IT.
- IT'S BEEN
A LONG JOURNEY.
- I THINK--
[SIREN]
- YAY! RIGHT WHEN
COURTNEY IS TALKING.
- OOH, GIRL!
MY TOP FOUR,
YOU'VE ALL COME SO FAR,
AND THE ONLY THING STANDING
BETWEEN YOU AND THE CROWN
IS YOU.
SO SHOULDERS BACK,
TITS OUT,
AND GIRL, YOU'D BETTER
SISSY THAT WALK.
- YES!
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
IT'S ME, BEN DE LA CREME.
I'M BACK.
YOU MADE IT
TO THE TOP FOUR!
CONDRAGULATIONS!
FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE STARRING
IN THE MUSIC VIDEO
"SISSY THAT WALK."
[CHEERING]
IT'S A TIMELESS TALE
OF AN INNOCENT GIRL
WHO SELLS HER SOUL
TO BECOME SISSY,
INTERNATIONAL SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- I LOVE IT.
- YOU'LL LEARN
SISSY-OGRAPHY
WITH WORLD-RENOWNED
CHOREOGRAPHER JAMAL SIMS.
YOU'LL ALSO BE STARRING
IN TWO ACTING SCENES,
WHERE YOU'LL BE IMPROVISING
WITH RU PAUL.
OH, AND I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE EACH INVITED
TO A LITTLE MOTHER-DAUGHTER
LUNCH WITH MAMA RU.
- AW...
- AND IN THE END, ONE OF YOU
WILL BE ELIMINATED.
- OH, BOY.
- UH...GAME CHANGER.
- WE ALL THOUGHT
NO ONE ELSE IS GOING HOME,
LIKE IN PAST SEASONS,
SO...YEAH, IT'S VERY THAT.
- SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- THIS IS IT. WE HAVE TO
DELIVER, OR WE GO HOME.
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES.
AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
- LADIES...
- HI!
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- UH, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU GUYS READY TO LEARN
SOME SISSY-OGRAPHY?
- YEAH.
- I THINK SO.
- COME WITH ME.
SISSY-OGRAPHY IS ABOUT NOT BEING
AFRAID TO BE SEXY AND HOT
AND FUN AND SASSY.
I'M LOOKING FOR THEM
TO GIVE IT.
JUST WATCH ME.
1, 2, AND 3, 4.
WALK BACK, BAH,
HOO, CLICK.
- WELL, THAT'S EASY.
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
- ADORE, LET'S GO.
GO. 1, 2, 3, AND 4.
5, 6, WHAT, 7, 8.
COURTNEY.
1, 2, 3, AND 4,
5, 6, 7, 8. GOOD.
BIANCA, HERE WE GO.
- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
I HAD A STROKE IN 1972.
- YOU GOT THIS. YOU GOT THIS.
COME ON WITH IT.
5, 6, 7, 8. GO.
- SHIT. I CAN'T.
AM I GOING DOWN, OR AM I--
- YOU'RE GOING--LOOK.
YOU'RE GONNA START
WITH YOUR CHEST, AND THEN THAT
ROLLS DOWN YOUR BODY.
LET IT...LET IT DIP.
YOU SEE THAT? THERE YOU ARE.
- YEAH? THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- JUST KEEP GOING.
- BUT LOOK, YOU CAN'T BE
SMILING LIKE THIS.
- YOU LIKE THIS?
YOU LIKE MY ROLL?
- BIANCA IS STRUGGLING
BECAUSE
SHE'S MORE WORRIED
ABOUT BEING FUNNY
TO DEFLECT THE FACT
THAT SHE'S NOT BEING GOOD.
- HA HA HA!
- MISS DARIENNE, READY?
- YEAH.
- LET'S GO SLOW.
- YEAH.
- SO 5, 6, 7.
LET'S GO.
GO. 1 AND 2, 3, 4.
- [INDISTINCT]
- I SEE YOU THINKING.
WE HAVE TO LET THAT GO.
NOW ALL TOGETHER.
5, 6, 7, 8.
AND 1, 2, 3, AND 4,
5, 6, 7, 8.
1, 2, AND 3, 4,
5, 6, AND 7, 8.
WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...
I GOT LOST ON THE FIRST ONE,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, BOY."
- YOU'RE DEFEATING YOURSELF
BEFORE WE EVEN START.
YOU COULD DO THIS.
- OH, BOY.
- THIS IS RU'S VIDEO,
SO WE CANNOT FUCK IT UP.
- COURTNEY ACT,
GET YOUR ASS IN HERE.
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE COOKING, SO I ORDERED IN.
- HA HA HA.
- SO, $100,000,
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
WHY SHOULD YOU
GET THE CROWN?
- I CAN LOOK GOOD, I CAN
SING GOOD, I CAN DANCE GOOD.
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO'S BETTER THAN ME,
THEN THEY SHOULD WIN,
BUT I TRULY FEEL
THAT I HAVE BEEN
MY BEST,
AND I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN
THE BEST AS WELL.
- YOU'VE BEEN CRITICIZED
FOR RESTING ON PRETTY
AND BEING DIPLOMATIC IN A WAY
THAT FELT SORT OF CANNED.
WHAT ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL,
VULNERABLE SIDE
OF COURTNEY ACT?
- I KNOW. IT CONCERNS ME
THAT IT SEEMS CANNED
BECAUSE I TRULY FEEL
LIKE I COME FROM
THIS PLACE OF OBJECTIVITY,
AND I FEEL LIKE,
IN THE COMPETITION AS WELL,
I'M IN, LIKE, WORK MODE,
AND I'M FOCUSED
ON WORK.
- WE CAN ALL STAND FOR
A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMANITY,
EVEN IF THAT HUMANITY
SEEMS MESSY AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
THAT VULNERABILITY.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
GIVE 'EM HELL
OUT THERE.
- I WILL. THANK YOU.
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, MOST
WORRIED ABOUT IN THIS CHALLENGE?
- I DON'T SEE
THE FUNCTION OF WORRY.
I THINK IT'S ALL
REALLY FUN.
- BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S TOP FOUR, BITCH.
LIKE, ANY TYPE OF, LIKE,
THING CAN HAPPEN
THAT CAN, LIKE,
SEND US HOME.
- WELL, YOU KNOW, RU SAID
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I TALK,
MY ANSWERS
CAN SOUND CANNED,
WHICH KIND OF CAME
AS A SHOCK,
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING I SAY
KIND OF COMES
FROM THE HEART.
AND I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
ENTIRELY WHAT SHE MEANS.
SO I CAN'T REALLY--
I'M NOT GONNA BLOW MY HEAD UP
THINKING ABOUT IT.
I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL EXCITED.
I'M HAPPY.
I'M DOING A WIG.
- IF YOU THINK FOR A MINUTE
THAT IT'S JUST A CAKEWALK...
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
THE LAST CHALLENGE.
I SEW, AND THIS BITCH
TAKES THE CAKE.
ALL OF US
SHOULD BE NERVOUS.
SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME,
AND WITH THAT CONFIDENCE,
IT MIGHT BE HER.
- COMING UP...
- SHE NEEDS TO IMPRESS
THE JUDGES,
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE CAN.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WHY, DARIENNE LAKE.
- HI, RU. HELLO, GORGEOUS.
- GET YOUR TUSH
IN HERE, DOLL.
SO, DARIENNE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FAMOUS.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH
PEOPLE SAYING THINGS,
MOSTLY...B.S.?
- YOU KNOW, I CAN BRUSH OFF
WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME
BECAUSE GROWING UP,
I'VE HEARD HORRIBLE THINGS.
- YOU WERE THROWN OUT OF
THE HOUSE AS A KID, WEREN'T YOU?
- IT WASN'T "PACK
YOUR BAGS AND LEAVE."
IT WAS MORE LIKE
AN INVITATION TO LEAVE.
MY MOTHER SAID, "YOU HAVE A LOT
OF NERVE TO STAND THERE
"IN MY HOUSE ON MY DIME
AND LIVE YOUR LIFESTYLE
THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF."
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"YOU'RE A CLOWN.
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU."
AND I THINK SHE STILL HAS
THAT WHOLE THING
THAT QUEERS ARE BELOW
ANY OTHER PERSON.
THERE WAS A LOT OF YEARS
OF NOT LOVING MYSELF.
- LOVING YOURSELF--IT REALLY
TAKES A DAILY PRACTICE.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
- THERE ARE THINGS
I'M GETTING FROM RU
THAT I DON'T GET
FROM MY OWN MOTHER.
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS REALLY
ENRICHED THE LOVE OF MYSELF.
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
NOW GET YOUR ASS
BACK TO WORK.
YOU'VE GOT
A CROWN TO WIN.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- I'M TRYING TO DECIDE,
FOR THE FINAL RUNWAY LOOK,
BETWEEN, LIKE, THIS
OR TO GO FOR SOMETHING
WITH A BIT MORE PIZZAZZ.
THIS IS THE FINAL TIME I'M GONNA
BE WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY.
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M GLITTERY AND FABULOUS.
THIS IS, LIKE,
A FEATHER BACKPACK
THAT'S GOT, LIKE, BIG PHEASANT
FEATHERS COMING OUT THE BACK.
THAT'S CUTE.
- I HAVE A HOODED THING
AS WELL.
- AH...
THAT'S PRETTY.
- MAYBE THIS IS
MY OPPORTUNITY
TO WEAR MY PRISCILLA WIG.
IT'S A LITTLE HOMAGE TO
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.
- I MAY NOT HAVE, LIKE,
EXPENSIVE-ASS GOWNS
OR ACCESSORIES
TO THE MAX,
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT
TO BE A FUCKIN' STAR.
LIKE, YOU CAN WEAR
A PAPER BAG,
AND YOU CAN SEE
OUT OF THE CROWD
WHO IS GONNA BE SOMETHING
OR WHO IS SOMETHING ALREADY.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR YET?
- I'LL WEAR
SOMETHING CUTE.
- ADORE REMINDS ME
OF ME 10 YEARS AGO.
THERE WAS, LIKE,
A SPARK AND A TALENT THERE,
BUT THERE WASN'T
THE REFINEMENT.
SHE NEEDS TO IMPRESS THE JUDGES,
AND I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN.
- IT'S JUST $10 ON eBAY.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- COME ON IN.
- I FEEL LIKE I'M
AT THE LAST SUPPER.
- WELL, HERE YOU ARE,
TOP FOUR.
- I KNOW.
- YOU'RE VERY ASTUTE.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BETTER PLAYERS
WE'VE HAD COME THROUGH HERE.
WHERE'S THAT COME FROM?
- I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
THAT HAVE TAUGHT ME
THAT, YOU KNOW,
THAT WERE LIKE, "QUEEN,
YOU DON'T NEED TO WEAR THAT WIG,
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT,"
AND NOW I CATCH MYSELF
ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS
SAYING THINGS TO OTHER QUEENS,
AND I'M LIKE, "I SOUND
LIKE THE OLD ONE NOW, YOU KNOW."
- NOW THE REST OF THE WORLD
WILL SEE THAT NICER SIDE.
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR THAT?
- YOU'VE BEEN FILMING THIS?
THERE'S TAPE
IN THOSE CAMERAS?
- YEAH.
- OH, GREAT!
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,
I HAD NO INTENTIONS
OF MENTORING ANY CHILD.
BUT IT'S BEEN
KIND OF REFRESHING
IN A WEIRD,
FUCKED-UP WAY.
- SO, ADORE, WHY SHOULD YOU
GET THE CROWN?
- THIS IS MY PASSION.
IT'S MY CALLING.
I WAS RAISED RIGHT,
SO I WOULD NOT LET YOU DOWN.
- SO, ADORE, YOU'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR MOM.
- YOU TALK ABOUT HER
ALL THE TIME.
- YEAH. LIKE, MY MOM
IS ALL I NEED.
SHE'S LIKE MY MOM, MY DAD,
MY GRANDPARENTS,
SHE'S EVERYTHING TO ME, SO...
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
- I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
- DO YOU WANT ONE?
WHY NOT?
- THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS
THAT HE SAID TO ME
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
WHEN I WAS 7,
HE SAID THAT, LIKE,
HE WAS BASICALLY
EMBARRASSED OF ME
BECAUSE I WAS FEMININE
AND I LIKED GIRL THINGS.
AND IT JUST REALLY
STUCK WITH ME.
THAT, I THINK, HAS A LOT
TO DO WITH MY CONFIDENCE.
LIKE, A LOT
OF MY FREAK-OUTS,
A LOT OF MY INSECURITIES
COME FROM THAT.
- A BONE, IN THE PLACE
IT WAS BROKEN,
AFTER IT HEALS, THAT BECOMES
THE STRONGEST PLACE ON THE BONE.
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?
SO THAT BROKEN
PLACE IN YOU
CAN BE YOUR SPIRITUAL
RESURRECTION,
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A FABULOUS KID
AND YOU'VE GOT
LOTS OF TALENT.
AND HE'S REALLY
MISSING OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR MOM'S NAME?
- BONNIE.
DO THIS FOR BONNIE.
SHE'S THE ONE ROOTING
FOR YOU BACK HOME.
AND YOU GO OUT THERE,
AND YOU DON'T LET THE SABOTEUR
GET YOU OFF THE TRACK.
- NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOOT
OUR DANCE ROUTINE
FOR "SISSY THAT WALK"
BY RU PAUL.
- LADIES, I REALLY WANT YOU
TO LOOK LIKE A PERFORMANCE,
NOT A REHEARSAL.
OK? CUE THE MUSIC.
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- COME ON!
HEY!
CUT. CUT.

PIT CREW WITH THE FANS.
ALL RIGHT. TIME TO PUT

ON THE TREADMILL.
BIANCA DEL RIO.

- IT'S WEIRD TO BE
ON A TREADMILL WITH HEELS.
NOW YOU ADD A FAN.
I'M HAVING HURRICANE
KATRINA FLASHBACKS.
SHIT.
JUST MAKE IT,

- OH.
UH!

OH, THAT TICKLED.
WAKE ME

- THERE WAS JUST MEANT
TO BE THREE SLAPS,
BUT PERHAPS I DID GO
FOR ABOUT 25.
KNOCK IT...HA HA HA!
- OH!
- AND WE'RE OUT.
THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
GO CHANGE AND GET READY FOR
YOUR SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO SHOOT
OUR SECOND SCENE WITH RU.
- I'M YOUR SCENE
PARTNER--CHARLES.
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
CHARLES.
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU'RE KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.
HA HA HA!
AND THERE HE IS.
RU PAUL IS NOW DRESSED UP
LIKE AN EXTRA FROM "GOOD TIMES."
- UH, REMEMBERING THIS WAS
A MAN YOU ONCE LOVED,
AND REALLY
GET THE AUDIENCE
TO FEEL THE HYSTERIA
OF A WOMAN ON THE VERGE.
- OK.
- ACTION.
- I CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW ORLEANS
TO BRING YOU HOME.
- DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?
I AM SISSY! SISSY!
S-I...
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SPELL,
BUT I DON'T
PLAY SCRABBLE.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
I AM SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- AND CUT.
IT WAS GOOD,
BUT YOU COULD CONNECT
A LITTLE MORE WITH CHARLES.
- OK.
- OKEY-DOKEY. ACTION!
- IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF, GIRL,
HOW IN THE HELL YOU GONNA
LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE, HUH?
- OH, NOW YOU'RE
WRITING POETRY?
HAVE A DRINK ON ME,
YOU BASTARD!
[CRASH]
- AND CUT.
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.
- HA HA HA!
- OK. ADORE.
AND ACTION.
- ADORE, I CAME ALL
THE WAY FROM AZUSA
TO BRING YOU HOME,
WHERE YOU BELONG.
- BELONG?
I DON'T BELONG
TO ANYBODY IN AZUSA.
I BELONG IN THE HEARTS
OF MY FANS.
THE BOYS LOVE SISSY.
THE LADIES LOVE SISSY.
EVERYBODY LOVES ME!
- GOOD-BYE.
- I'M SISSY, DAMN IT!
SUPERMODEL OF THE WORLD.
- CUT. ADORE,
THE INTENSITY IS NICE.
BUT IT'S A PARODY.
PUT SOME MORE TICS
INTO IT.
- OK.
- OH, DARLING,
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR METHOD ON.
- THIS IS THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY
TO LET MY HAIR DOWN
AND BE MESSY
AND BE SILLY,
AND I DON'T NEED TO BE THAT SORT
OF PERFECT POLISHED COURTNEY.
- ACTION.
- I'VE COME ALL THE WAY
FROM SYDNEY TO BRING YOU HOME.
- I BELONG RIGHT HERE.
I DON'T EVEN SOUND
AUSTRALIAN ANYMORE.
EVERYBODY LOVES ME HERE.
THE WHOLE WORLD
LOVES SISSY!
- YOU DO BIG REALLY WELL.
COULD YOU JUST BRING
THE LITTLE BIT
OF VULNERABILITY
OR LOSS INTO IT?
- I SEE NOW
THAT COURTNEY'S DEAD.
SO GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
NIGHT!
- I'M THE SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- CUT. THAT WAS GREAT.
PICTURE UP. ACTION.
- THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.
THIS IS MY HOME--
ON THE STAGE, ON THE COVERS
OF THE MAGAZINES.
- CUT. THIS IS
A MAN THAT YOU LOVED.
I DIDN'T FEEL
YOUR CONFLICT.
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.
- SO GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
- CHARLES!
[SOBBING]
DON'T GO!
- SISSY. LOOK WHAT THEY'VE
DONE TO YOU, SISSY.
COME BACK.
- WOULD YOU STILL
HAVE ME?
- COME TO ME.
COME ON, MAMA.
- AND...CUT!
WOW. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL,
UNEXPECTED, AND AMAZING.
GUESS WHAT.
THAT'S A WRAP.
- THAT WAS FUN.
- COMING UP...
- THE SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE
WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS.
THAT'S NOT STRONG
ENOUGH FOR ME.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- THIS IS THE LAST DAY,
AND WE ALL HAVE OUR BOW
AND ARROW SET FOR THE TOP THREE.
GODDAMN. THIS IS IT.
- I REMEMBER
ON THE FIRST DAY MEETING ADORE,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, I DON'T LIKE HER."
- WOW.
- I WAS LIKE, "I'M THE IDOL
DRAG QUEEN, NOT YOU."
- I KIND OF GOT THAT ENERGY
FROM YOU IN THE BEGINNING.
- BUT THEN IT WAS LIKE,
"ACTUALLY, I REALLY LIKE HER."
- YEAH.
I'M FUCKING COOL.
- LIKE, FOR MY FIRST
IMPRESSION OF EVERYBODY,
I KIND OF KNEW
WHO COURTNEY ACT WAS.
- KIND OF?
- OH, I'M SORRY, BUT I KNOW
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
"OH, SHE'S PRETTY. SHE'S
PROBABLY A BITCH IN REAL LIFE."
YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.
MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF COURTNEY--
BEAUTIFUL, KIND OF TALENTED,
POLISHED.
AND NOW SHE'S LIKE A TRUE
SOUL SISTER TO ME,
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S
A ROBOT SOMETIMES.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, "SHE SEEMS
SWEET. SHE SEEMS NICE."
- WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
I WAS AFRAID OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE
VERY QUICK-WITTED,
AND I KNEW THAT YOU COULD
SHUT ME DOWN IN SECONDS.
IT'S REALLY SURPRISING
THAT BIANCA AND I GET ALONG
BECAUSE AT FIRST SHE REMINDED ME
OF THE GIRLS BACK HOME
THAT REALLY DON'T LIKE ME.
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA FIGHT.
BUT WHEN I GOT TO KNOW YOU,
THE DYNAMIC CHANGED SO MUCH.
I FEEL LIKE YOU BROUGHT
ANOTHER SIDE OUT OF ME.
- NOW, ADORE, THE FIRST DAY
THAT I MET YOU,
YOU WERE STANDING
NEXT TO LAGANJA,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, FUCK."
BUT IT CLICKED,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, SHE'S FUN,
SHE'S COOL,"
BECAUSE YOU HAD SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT HOG BODY,
AND I'M LIKE, "I'VE GOT
THIS EXTRA CORSET.
LET ME HELP
THIS BITCH OUT."
WHAT I LIKE MOST
ABOUT ADORE
IS THAT SHE'S FEARLESS
AND SHE'S FUN.
AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT REALLY
A PART OF MY WORLD.
HAD YOU BEEN LAGANJA, YOU'D HAVE
BEEN FAT THE WHOLE TIME.
I WOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN IT TO HER.
- I WANT BIANCA TO FINISH
A SENTENCE WITHOUT A JOKE.
- OK. COURTNEY
IS AN ASSHOLE. HA HA HA!
- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
AN UNCOMFORTABILITY
WITH ACTUALLY LETTING PEOPLE
KNOW THAT YOU'RE NICE.
- I THINK THAT PEOPLE ALL
THE TIME SPEND TOO MUCH ENERGY
GOING "I LOVE YOU,"
AND THAT'S JUST WEIRD.
SO I'D RATHER GO, "I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOUR WIG IS HORRIBLE."
THAT'S JUST
MY APPROACH.
- BIANCA IS
A FORMIDABLE TALENT,
BUT AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR NEEDS TO HAVE
A COMPASSION
AND A WARMTH,
AND I DON'T EXPERIENCE
THAT IN HER.
- THE SCARY PART
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING
IS THAT WE'VE COME
ALL THIS WAY,
AND THERE'S A HUGE CHANCE
THAT YOU DON'T MAKE IT.
IT'S THAT MOMENT
OF, LIKE, "SHIT!"
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE,
"OH, I FINALLY GOT TO HAWAII,
AND THEN I FELL
IN A VOLCANO."
FINAL RUNWAY,

THIS IS IT.

- WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR THE JUDGES'
FINAL CRITIQUE.
FIRST UP, ADORE.
- I THINK THIS IS A FLATTERING
DRESS FOR YOUR SHAPE.
I THINK YOUR FACE
LOOKS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
THE HAIR TONIGHT--
I ALMOST THOUGHT YOU WERE
WEARING A HEADBAND
WHEN YOU CAME OUT HERE.
- THE SOLO DANCING,
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
YOU PUT ADORE INTO IT,
WHICH I ENJOYED.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ACTING TWO WAS MY FAVORITE.
I WAS IN A NOVELLA
WITH YOU,
BUT IT WAS GOOD ACTING.
YOU SOLD ME ON IT.
- THANK YOU, ADORE.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- NEXT UP, BLAME IT
ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- TONIGHT THIS COLOR
IS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.
- THANKS.
- AS A GROUP,
YOU AND COURTNEY ACT TOGETHER
REALLY WERE IN SYNC,
AND IT LOOKED GREAT.
- SOLO I THOUGHT YOU DID
A GOOD JOB AS WELL.
IT'S FUN TO SEE YOU
IN A SEXY LIGHT.
- FOR YOUR INGENUE,
YOUR EXPRESSIONS WERE SO FUNNY.
- AND THE IMPROV
WAS PHENOMENAL.
IT BEARS REPEATING.
IT WAS VERY FUNNY.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
TONIGHT, YOU LOOK FLAWLESS.
I DON'T THINK
I'D CHANGE A THING.
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH, REALLY,
JUST VERY, VERY HAPPY.
- YOU SHOULD BE ON THE COVER
OF "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR OWN SPREAD.
- LET'S DO IT.
- AS THE INGENUE,
THE SLAPS WERE REALLY FUNNY.
YOU WENT THERE.
AS SISSY WITH CHARLES,
THE PROPS,
LIKE THE GLASSES,
THEY KIND OF DISTRACTED
FROM YOUR FACE.
- GROUP CHOREOGRAPHY--
YOU NAILED IT.
- LOVED THE WIDE SHOTS,
BUT THE CLOSE-UPS SEEMS
SO FRENETIC AND KIND OF, UH...
TOO MUCH.
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
DARIENNE LAKE.
- TONIGHT IS JUST
CLASSIC DARIENNE,
AND IT'S SO,
SO BEAUTIFUL.
- YOUR LIP-SYNCING
IS SO MAJOR
IN YOUR PIECE
AS THE INGENUE,
I COULD WATCH THAT
ON REPEAT FOR HOURS.
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.
- AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE
WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS,
FLAT-LINED.
YOU DIDN'T REALLY GET IT GOING
TILL THE END.
BUT THEN WHEN YOU DID
GET IT GOING,
YOU KEPT IT GOING.
THAT WAS
THE MAGICAL PART.
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, DARIENNE.
LADIES, FINAL QUESTION--
WHY SHOULD YOU
AND NOT YOUR COMPETITORS
BE CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?'
LET'S START WITH ADORE.
- THESE GIRLS UP HERE
ARE ALL STARS,
BUT I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT IT.
I'M AMERICA'S NEXT
DRAG SUPERSTAR.
I FEEL LIKE I'M RELATABLE.
I'M APPROACHABLE.
AND WITH THIS TITLE,
I WILL BE VERY PROUD
TO CARRY ON THE LEGACY
AND TEACH ALL THE LITTLE
MERMAIDS OF THE WORLD.
I JUST REALLY, REALLY
WANT TO MAKE YOU PROUD.
I'M ALREADY A WINNER,
BUT THE CROWN REALLY WOULD
COMPLETE THIS WHOLE LOOK
AND EVERYTHING.
AND I LOVE YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, ADORE.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THERE'S AN OLD SAYING
THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.
FOR ME, IT WASN'T GOING
THROUGH THE COMPETITION
WITH AN ADOLESCENT CHARM,
GOING THROUGH IT
WITH A FABULOUS BODY
AND BEAUTY,
OR GOING THROUGH IT
WITH GREAT LIP-SYNC TALENTS.
I HAD DRESSES, I HAD HAIR,
AND A GUARD.
I HAVE BUILT UP
THIS WALL,
AND THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS CHANGED ME,
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE THIS MAGICAL
OR THIS INSPIRING,
BUT IT IS.
I WENT THROUGH
A SELF-DISCOVERY,
ACCEPTING THAT I'M NOT
SUCH A BAD BITCH,
AND I THANK
ALL OF YOU PERSONALLY
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY CHILLY LITTLE HEART
THANKS.
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT,
SAME QUESTION.
- IN AUSTRALIA,
I'M AUSTRALIA'S DRAG SUPERSTAR.
AND I'VE HAD SO MANY WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITIES THERE
TO HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MOMENTS
AND A LOT OF BAD MOMENTS
AND LEARN FROM
ALL OF THAT.
AND I SORT OF CAME
TO AMERICA
AS LIKE A POLISHED PRODUCT,
AND I FEEL THAT
I CAN TAKE THIS
AND I CAN MAKE
THE MOST OUT OF IT.
YOU SAY THIS IS
THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG,
AND I WANT TO TAKE
THAT OLYMPIC TORCH,
AND I WANT TO KEEP
RUNNING WITH IT,
AND I WANT TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
- THANK YOU.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MORE QUEEN PER POUND.
THERE IS NO
COMPARING ME TO OTHERS.
ADORE, SOMETIMES
YOU GET A LITTLE RATTLED.
BIANCA, I COULD TEACH YOU
MAYBE A LITTLE THING
ABOUT SENSITIVITY.
COURTNEY,
WHAT A SEXY DISH,
BUT THIS DISH
NEEDS A LITTLE SALT.
YOU HAVE SEEN
MY TALENTS.
I WILL MAKE EVERYONE
WHO IS SITTING THERE
THINKING THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
THAT IF THIS OLD
BITTER QUEEN CAN DO IT,
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, DARIENNE.
WELL, THANK YOU,
MY QUEENS.
I THINK
WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US SQUIRRELS,
WHAT DID WE THINK?
LET'S START WITH ADORE.
ADORE IS 23 YEARS OLD, AND HER
SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE
SPOKE LIKE SOMEONE
WHO'S 23 YEARS OLD.
- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
SHE WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART,
AND SHE GOT
HER POINT ACROSS.
- ADORE'S ACTING
WAS SO WELL DONE,
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
A REAL SCENE.
- SHE'S A PERFORMER.
ADORE IS DEFINITELY A SUPERSTAR.
- SHE LIKES THE SORT OF
TRASHY-GIRL AESTHETIC.
- BUT SHE'S JUST
SO DAMN CHARMING
THAT NO MATTER
WHAT SHE DOES,
I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF OF HER.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HER INGENUE WAS FUNNY,
AND SHE BRINGS HER INTELLIGENCE
TO THE GAME.
- IT BEARS REPEATING.
- IT'S HILARIOUS.
- TO ME, BIANCA COMES OFF
AS USING COMEDY AS A WALL.
HER SHTICK IS, "COLD AS ICE,
MY HEART IS BLACK."
- YEAH, HER HUMOR CAN BE
A LITTLE ABRASIVE AND DANGEROUS.
IS THAT THE BEST CHOICE
FOR THE BRAND?
- BUT THAT SPEECH THAT SHE MADE
WAS PRETTY AMAZING.
IT'S INTERESTING JUST SEEING
HER VULNERABILITY,
AND SHE HAD NO PROBLEM
HELPING THE OTHER GIRLS
BACK IN THE WORK ROOM
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
THREATENED BY THEM.
- NO.
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE HAD
MORE VARIETY IN
HER RUNWAY LOOKS, THOUGH.
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.
- IT'S OBVIOUS
THE CAMERA LOVES HER.
- YES. SHE HAS A PRESENCE.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
- HER ACTING TWO CHALLENGE
WAS INTERESTING.
SHE HAD ALL THE SHTICK
WITH THE STRAW IN HER HAIR,
THE GLASSES COCKEYED.
- NOTHING WAS SUBTLE
ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE.
- BUT SHE DID ALLUDE
TO THE FACT
THAT SHE DOESN'T SPEAK WITH
AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ANYMORE.
- WHICH I APPRECIATED.
- IT'S SUPER FUNNY.
- NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
HER SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE.
- SHE'S AUSTRALIA'S
VERSION OF RU PAUL.
- RIGHT. THAT'S NOT
STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME.
I WANTED HER
TO MOVE ME.
- I DON'T GET MAD
WHEN PEOPLE TALK LIKE THAT,
ESPECIALLY
FROM COURTNEY ACT,
WHO I THINK IS
AN IMMENSE TALENT
AND WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO DARIENNE LAKE.
- THE SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE,
WHEN SHE STARTED TO BREAK DOWN,
THEN I GOT SUCKED IN.
- HER DELIVERY WAS
JUST HILARIOUS, JUST SO FUNNY.
- AND IT EVEN MADE CHARLES
COME BACK IN AND GET HER.
- IN THE SISSY-OGRAPHY,
DARIENNE LAKE GOT DOWN
WITH THE GET-DOWN.
- SHE'S A FIERCE LIP-SYNCER.
- SHE IS.
- YOU KNOW, ALL ABOUT
SELLING FACE CONSTANTLY.
- IN FACT, SHE WON
THE "SCREAM QUEEN" CHALLENGE
JUST BECAUSE OF HER HEAD.
- I'VE WON LOTS OF STUFF
WITH MY HEAD.
- SILENCE!
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
NOW, BEFORE I CAN DECIDE
WHO MAKES IT TO THE TOP THREE,
I NEED TO SEE EACH OF YOU
LIP-SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE.
FOUR QUEENS
STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- ALL FOUR OF US
HAVE TO LIP-SYNC,
AND WE'RE COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER.
THIS IS LIKE
A LIP-SYNC DEATH MATCH.
- GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SHANTE YOU STAY.
G-G-G-GIA,
SASHAY AWAY.
- WHOO!
- CONGRATULATIONS,
LAGANJA.
- I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I AM
STILL IN THIS COMPETITION.
- YES, GIRL, YOU MADE IT.
- YOU LIVE ANOTHER DAY.
- BUT IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
I'M USED TO WINNING.
SO IN THIS COMPETITION,
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE ALL
MY FRIENDS GET A LOT OF PRAISE,
ESPECIALLY ADORE,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HER LOOK
IS AS STRONG AS MINE,
AND IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO GET TO ME.
- LAGANJA IS AN EXTREMELY
EMOTIONAL PERSON,

I THINK SHE'S JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HER FEELINGS
JUST AS MUCH
AS I DO, TOO.
- UM...WELL, MOST OF THE GIRLS--
I HAD ALREADY SHARED THIS
IN "UNTUCKED."
BUT I WANT TO TAKE
THE TIME OUT TO TELL EVERYBODY
AUGUST OF 2012, I WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH H.I.V.
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT
WITH EVERYBODY IN HERE
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE
AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE
IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY
WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH THIS
AND THEY'RE SCARED
TO SAY SOMETHING.
AND I NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S OK.

I THINK IT'S AMAZING.
GOOD JOB.

CONGRATULATIONS, MISS DE LA!

YOU WON A CHALLENGE.

- OH, YOU DID? OH.

YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.
I THINK IT'S BETTER

AFTER SEEING YOU IN DRAG,
I REALIZE NOW WHY SEATTLE HAS
A HIGH SUICIDE RATE.

EVEN HER ASSHOLE HAS A LISP.
THEN WE HAVE ADORE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU GOT

IF YOU CAN'T READ YOURSELF,
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU
READ SOMEBODY ELSE? THANK YOU.
- JOSLYN FOX, YOU MAY NOT
BE ALL THAT SMART,
AND YOU MAY NOT BE
ALL THAT PRETTY...
- HA HA HA!
- I GUESS THAT'S IT.
- HA HA HA!
- MISS DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU SHOULD BE ARRESTED
FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY.
THE WAY YOU ABUSE THOSE
KITTEN HEELS ON THE RUNWAY
IS ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL!
- BEN DE LA CREME,
THE CREAM ALWAYS
RISES TO THE TOP,
BUT THEN AGAIN,
SO DOES THE SCUM.

WHEN WE NEED
A LOW-RENT VERSION OF COURTNEY

JUST SO SHE HAS A FLAT
SURFACE TO EAT OFF OF.

SOME REALLY COMFORTING
OLD-FASHIONED QUALITIES,

MORE LIKE UFO's--
I MEAN, THEY ARE
WAY OUT THERE,

I'M GOING TO SAY THIS
VERY SLOWLY
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE DUMB.

WHAT I'M SAYING?

FOR THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'RE GONNA FACE OFF

WHO'S GOT A FAST MOUTH?
BIANCA DEL RIO.

NOT TO PICK TWO OF MY IDOLS--
ADORE DELANO
AND COURTNEY ACT.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DARIENNE
ISN'T CHOOSING ME.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A SLAP IN THE FACE
TO NOT BE CHOSEN WITH THE REST
OF THOSE GIRLS.
- AND THAT MEANS
THE OTHER CREW
IS MILK, BEN DE LA CREME, JOSLYN
FOX, AND TRINITY K. BONET.

- LOVE IT.
- I THINK MILK
COULD PULL IT OFF,
BUT AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY
MY VOICE IS GOING REALLY HIGH,
I COULD BE LYING.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
MISS TRINITY?
- I'M GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T GET
VERY SERIOUS OR VERY NICE
ABOUT MANY THINGS.
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY TO YOU
THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU FOR
PUTTING YOUR STORY OUT THERE.
- AS SOON AS TRINITY
DISCUSSED HER STATUS,
IT ALL MADE SENSE TO ME
AS TO WHY SHE WAS BEING
SUCH AN INTROVERT
AND ANTISOCIAL, BECAUSE
I'D BEEN THROUGH IT
WITH SOMEONE ELSE
BEFORE.
I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE.
FOR A WHILE,
WHEN I MOVED TO NEW YORK,
I DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK TO HIM,
DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM,
AND I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT REALLY WAS HAPPENING.
AND I HAD FOUND OUT
THROUGH EVERYONE ELSE
THAT HE WAS HIV-POSITIVE,
AND HE DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED
TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE
BECAUSE HE WAS
SO FULL OF SHAME.
SO THE STIGMA WITH THIS ISSUE
AND THIS SICKNESS...
AND IT WAS JUST FAR TOO MUCH
FOR HIM TO HANDLE.
I HAD FOUND OUT
THAT HE HAD PASSED AWAY.
- WHEN I FOUND OUT, LIKE,
IT WASN'T A SENSE
OF "OH, MY GOD,
MY LIFE IS OVER."
LIKE, THE FIRST THING WAS,
"HOW DO WE FIX IT?"
I JUST KNEW THAT THERE WAS
SO MUCH IN LIFE
THAT I WANTED TO ACHIEVE
AND THAT I WASN'T GONNA ALLOW
H.I.V. TO GET
IN THE WAY.
- I REALLY DO ADMIRE TRINITY
FOR BEING OPEN AND HONEST
AND TAKING CARE OF HERSELF
THE WAY SHE DOES,
BECAUSE IF MY FRIEND
HAD DONE THE SAME,
I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE
TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AN AMAZING THING,
AND IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
CALL A HATEFUL BITCH LIKE ME,
EVEN IF IT'S FOR A LAUGH.
- BIANCA'S SECRETLY ADORABLE
IN A CERTAIN WAY,
LIKE SHE'S THE TYPE
OF PERSON
WHERE YOU, LIKE,
WANT TO HUG HER,
AND SHE'S JUST LIKE,
"UH, GET AWAY."
LIKE, IT'S VERY THAT,
BUT SHE LOVES YOU.

AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
COMING UP...
- THE HIP-HOP WAS
SOMETHING THAT THREW YOU.
- YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.
- DON'T BE A CLICHE, MY DEAR.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- LADIES, THIS WEEK
YOU WORKED IN GROUPS,
BUT TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE
JUDGED INDIVIDUALLY.
COURTNEY ACT.
IT'S A CLICHE, BUT YOU'RE
RESTING ON PRETTY.
DON'T BE A CLICHE, MY DEAR.
COURTNEY ACT.
BEN DE LA CREME
AND LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU ARE...SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY LEAVE
THE STAGE.
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
LET'S START WITH
JOSLYN FOX.
- YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BIT BUSY.
- ALL THE LAYERS
ON TOP OF LAYERS,
IT JUST STARTS TO GET
A LITTLE MESSY FOR ME.
- I DO FEEL LIKE I TEND
TO OVERACCESSORIZE.
- I ALWAYS
LOVE IT MYSELF.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO
PLEASE THESE BITCHES UP HERE,
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT TO...
- I THINK YOUR RAP WAS GREAT.
I LOVE "MOTHER-FISHER."
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU REALLY STEPPED UP,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
- HA HA. THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT. NEXT UP,
TRINITY K. BONET-NET.
HEY, GIRL.
- YOU GIVE ME
NAOMI CAMPBELL DOWN.
- NOW LET'S MOVE
TO THE RAP.
THE LOOK WAS
REALLY SPOT-ON.
IT WAS SALT-N-PEPA
MEETS ANITA BAKER.
BUT YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.
- YOU FREAKED YOURSELF OUT.
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THE QUEEN TO MAKE EXCUSES,
BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO.
I LIP-SYNC FOR A LIVING.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, TRINITY.
NEXT UP, MILK.
- THE RAP WASN'T
ON BEAT,
BUT IT WAS YOUR OWN
PERSONALIZED UNIQUENESS.
YOU JUST WENT INTO
THIS LITTLE FUNNY...
YEAH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT WAS JUST SO YOU.
- THE CLOTHES WERE
WAY OFF FOR ME.
YOU HAD, LIKE, JOEY BUTTAFUOCO
ZUBAZ PANTS ON.
NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIP-HOP.
LOTS TO DO WITH THE BOYS I USED
TO HAVE SEX WITH AT THE GYM.
TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU
WITH PRETTY MAKEUP ON.
BUT I WOULDN'T EVER TURN AROUND
IN THAT SKIRT AGAIN.
- IT LOOKS LIKE BED SHEETS
WRAPPED AROUND YOU,
PINNED IN THE BACK.
THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
NEEDS TO BE JUST AS ON POINT
AS WHEN YOU COME OUT HERE
WITH A PINOCCHIO NOSE.
- ALL RIGHT.
DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, DARIENNE, PRETTY DRESS.
IT'S NOTHING SPECTACULAR.
- YESTERDAY,
WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE,
YOU GAVE ME, LIKE, MISSY ELLIOTT
WITH THE TRASH BAG.
I WANTED TO SEE YOU,
LIKE, BUST OUT OF IT
AND, LIKE, JUST REALLY
GIVE IT TO US,
BUT YOU WERE
A LITTLE WITHHELD.
- I THINK THE HIP-HOP
THREW YOU A LITTLE BIT.
- NEXT UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL I'VE SEEN YOU YET.
YOUR EYE MAKEUP--
YOU DIDN'T PUT
THAT HARSH WHITE LINE.
- I DIDN'T PUT IT,
BUT I DID SNORT IT.
- AT LEAST IT WAS USED.
- THAT'S WHY
I'M ALERT, GIRL.
- YESTERDAY,
YOU WERE HILARIOUS.
- OTHER THAN
THE PIGTAILS, THOUGH,
YOU WERE GIVING ME
KIND OF URKEL.
- I DISAGREE,
BECAUSE AS B-GIRLS,
THAT WAS THE LOOK
THAT WE ROCKED.
- AND LET ME
REMIND EVERYBODY
THAT MICHELLE VISAGE
IS ALSO A RAPPER.
SHE HAD A SONG
ON THE "BODYGUARD" SOUNDTRACK.
- TRACK 9. GO ON.
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
ADORE DELANO.
- WELL, ADORE, I'M HAPPY TO SEE
THAT YOU HAVE A WAIST.
- BUT?
- BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS KIND OF
MID-SHIN LENGTH?
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,
AND I WANTED
TO SHOW MY BODY.
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU ASSASSINATED THE RAP.
YOU'RE ON RHYTHM.
YOU WERE LIKE
JUST A REAL ARTIST.
- YOUR LYRICS WERE GREAT.
YOUR ATTITUDE WAS EVERYTHING.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
- WELL, THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE REVVING]
ALL RIGHT. NOW, JUST BETWEEN
US FREAKNIKS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
STARTING WITH JOSLYN FOX?
- HER RUNWAY LOOK TONIGHT
WAS JUST A DISASTER.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD
HAVE THAT MUCH ON AND STILL--
- BE THAT NAKED?
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK SHE NAILED
THE VIDEO.
- THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
LIKE I REALLY HEARD HER VOICE,
AND IT BOOMED THROUGH.
- ALL RIGHT.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- IN THE VIDEO,
SHE GOT HER GHETTO PASS REVOKED
FOR THAT RAP, FOR REAL.
- AND AGAIN, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
MUCH OF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.
- I THINK SHE GAVE UP REALLY
BEFORE SHE STARTED.
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.
- UP NEXT, MILK.
- I THINK MILK IS REALLY,
REALLY UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT...
AND OFF, BUT IT WORKS.
- HOWEVER, WE ASKED
TO SEE MORE FROM MILK,
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE BROUGHT
OUT HERE TONIGHT.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- DARIENNE LOOKED LOVELY
TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
BUT IN THE VIDEO, HER DELIVERY
NEEDED A LOT OF WORK.
- SHE SEEMED
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
SHE REALLY WASN'T
DELIVERING HER PERFORMANCE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ON THE RUNWAY,
SHE LOOKED INCREDIBLE.
- HER HIP-HOP THING
WAS HILARIOUS,
BECAUSE IT WAS
ON THE COMEDY SIDE.
- BUT IT DID GET TO BE
A LITTLE "DUDE."
- UP NEXT, ADORE DELANO.
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE, KIDS.
EVERY TIME I SAY,
"LOOK AT THE LENGTH,"
SHE COMES OUT THE NEXT WEEK
IN THE SAME LENGTH.
- YESTERDAY, SHE CAME OUT
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
AND JUST SLAYED IT.
- TENS ALL THE WAY--
LOOK, ATTITUDE, CHARACTER,
PERSONALITY, EVERYTHING.
- THE QUESTION IS--
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY HOMEGIRLS.
AND, UH...
♪ OH, NO, SHE BETTER DON'T ♪

SHE BETTER DON'T ♪

YOU ARE SAFE.

YOU PUSHED IT REAL GOOD.
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]

OF CUSTOM-MADE JEWELRY
FROM THE FOUNDRY.
- JESUS KNOWS I NEED IT.
I WON FINALLY.
I'M MOTHERFUCKING LEGIT.
- JOSLYN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
TRINITY K. BONET.
MCTKB WAS NOT A TKO.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
MILK, YOUR RAP AND RUNWAY LOOK
WERE NOT MC SUPREME.
DARIENNE LAKE, YOUR PERFORMANCE
AS MC CONTROL TOP
WAS NO RAPPERS DELIGHT.
DARIENNE LAKE...
YOU ARE SAFE.
[EXHALES]
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
MILK, I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS
STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME AND SAVE
YOURSELF FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
[THUNDER]
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE!
- I'M FEELING SHOCKED.
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE
IN THE BOTTOM TWO,
BUT I'M GONNA
WORK IT OUT.

- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS,
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR TWERKS OF ART.
LET'S START WITH JOSLYN.
- THERE'S A HEART HERE, AND
IT HAS SUNGLASSES ON LIKE ME
'CAUSE LOVE'S BLIND.
LOVE.
- BUT DOES IT MATCH MY COUCH?
- THIS PIECE IS CALLED
"IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST
BEFORE THE DAWN."
- OOH. ANDY WHORE-HOL.
OH.
- I STARTED OFF WITH A BEAUTIFUL
EQUALITY EQUALS SIGN
AND STARTED WHIPPING IT
WITH MY HAIR.
- VERY LADY GAGA.
- IT'S CHAOS.
- I BROUGHT AN ANGEL THROUGH
LOVE, BRING HAPPY LITTLE TREES
AND BIRDS AND BEES.
- GORGEOUS.
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IT UPSIDE-DOWN.
- OH, OH, OK.
I SEE IT NOW!
- THESE PURPLE COLUMNS--ONE
IS GOVERNMENT, ONE IS SOCIETY,
AND THROUGH THAT, THE HEART
IS GROWING AND BECOMING WHOLE.
- VERY TYRA BANKS-Y.
- MY TWERK OF ART REPRESENTS
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN COMING
TOGETHER TO FORM
ONE BEAUTIFUL BODY.
- I DON'T SEE IT.
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
GOING TO A SPORTS GAME.
- STOP RELYING ON
THAT BOTTICELLI.
WELL, NICE WORK, LADIES.
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
MINI-CHALLENGE IS...
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- OH!
- CONDRAGULATIONS.
- MY KID COULD HAVE DONE THAT.
- SHUT UP.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES, CLEAN UP,
'CAUSE WE GOT COMPANY COMING.
- UH-OH.
- LET'S GO.
- CAN THIS THING
GO ANY FASTER?
THIS WEEK, LADIES, LOVE IS
IN THE AIR, AND I WANT YOU TO
MEET SOME TRULY SPECIAL WOMEN.
- OH.
- NOW,
TOMORROW I'LL HAVE THE HONOR
OF MARRYING THESE LADIES ON
THE MAIN STAGE, BECAUSE, YES,
MAMA Ru IS AN ORDAINED
MINISTER, Y'ALL.
WHOO! WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
I WANT YOU TO MEET ANNA,
EDDIE, BRITTANY, AMY D., DAWN,
AND AMY S.
- I CLICK.
THIS IS THE MAKEOVER
CHALLENGE.
I'M INSTANTLY KIND OF GOING
UP AND DOWN THE LINE WONDERING
WHO'S GONNA BE THE BEST BRIDE.
- NOW, BIANCA, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO PAIR UP
THE QUEENS WITH THE LADIES.
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
MS. BRITTANY AND
GIVE HER TO JOSLYN,
'CAUSE SHE
LIKES HER ACCESSORIES.
[LAUGHTER]
- HI, BRITTANY.
- I THINK I WANT MISS EDDIE.
COME THIS WAY.
- GREAT. HEY!
- SHE SEEMS SASSY.
AMY, YOU SEEM LIKE YOU
WOULD DO WELL WITH ADORE.
- HI.
- YOU SEEM LIKE
A COURTNEY TYPE.
- OK.
- BLONDE.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- ANNA,
THIS IS DARIENNE.
- OH, HI!
- AMY,
THIS IS BENDELA.
- HI, AMY.
- NOW, LADIES,
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR A STRONG FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE.
YOU'LL USE MATERIALS
FROM FABRIC PLANET
AND YOUR OWN DRAG.
AS DRAG MOTHERS OF THE BRIDE,
I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR
CHARISMA, UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT TO MAKE THEIR WEDDING
THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF THEIR LIFE, BUT TO DO THAT,
FIRST YOU NEED TO
MEET THE GROOMS.
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.
NOW, FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE, YOU WON'T BE MAKING
OVER THESE WOMEN.
NO, NO, THAT'D BE TOO EASY.
INSTEAD, YOU'LL USE THE MAGIC
OF DRAG TO TRANSFORM THESE
GALLANT GROOMS INTO
BLUSHING BRIDES.
IT'S A NICE DAY FOR
A DRAG WEDDING.
[LAUGHTER]
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
- I DON'T DO PEOPLE'S MAKEUP.
I DON'T SEW.
I'M JUST GONNA FUCKIN' SIT ON
A CONE AND WAIT FOR A TRUCK TO
HIT ME AT THIS POINT.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
I'M OVER IT.
- OH, NO!
- COMING UP...
- IS IT GONNA HANG
LIKE A BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- OUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO
TURN STRAIGHT GROOMS INTO
BLUSHING BRIDES.
THE KEY TO BRIDAL WEAR IS
MAKING SURE THE BRIDE IS HAPPY,
SO THE FIRST THING WE DO IS
SIT DOWN WITH OUR COUPLES
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'D
LIKE FOR THEIR WEDDING.
ALL RIGHT, HOW DO
WE FEEL ABOUT MAKEUP?
ARE WE THINKING A SOFT
EYE AND A BRIGHT LIP?
OR ARE WE THINKING
A DOMINANT EYE?
- I THINK A DOMINANT EYE
AND A DOMINANT LIP.
- OH, YOU ARE MY KIND
OF GIRL, EDDIE!
- YES.
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT
THIS CHALLENGE.
I'M CURRENTLY ENGAGED,
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING WEDDING.
THIS IS JUST
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
OK, SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF VISION?
- I CAN SEE A
FLORULENT PRINCESS LOOK.
- YOU'RE GONNA LOOK SO PURTY.
- PRETTY.
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]
- WE CAN GIVE YOU SOME PADDING,
TOO, SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME WIDER
HIPS SO YOU'LL HAVE SOME BODY.
- OH, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT BODY.
- AREN'T YOU GETTING EXCITED?
I DON'T THINK BRANDON HAS
ANY IDEA WHAT HE SIGNED
HIMSELF UP FOR.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SHAVING?
- I'M OK WITH THAT.
- YEAH?
- WE CAN WORK
WITH IT, YEAH.
- OK, COOL.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN KEVIN
WITHOUT A BEARD, SO I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
SAW YOURSELF WITHOUT A BEARD?
- 6 YEARS.
- THE MOST WORRISOME THING
ABOUT THE BEARD IS NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S UNDER THERE.
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT FOR THIS WEDDING?
- I WOULD LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING, LIKE,
MORE GOTHY AND COOL.
YOU KNOW, ROCK AND ROLL,
HORROR, AND NOT TRADITIONAL.
- HE NEEDS TO LOOK FIERCE,
LIKE SHARON AND DETOX.
- OK, SHARON AND DETOX,
SORT OF?
- YEAH.
- SO, GOTH?
THE MATERIALS SUPPLIED ARE
WHITE, SILVER--NOT GOTH.
AAAH!
- YOU'RE QUITE A TALL,
SOLID MAN.
MY ONLY WEAKNESS IS, YOU DON'T
HAPPEN TO BE A TAILOR, DO YOU?
YOU WEREN'T A TAILOR IN
THE ARMY, WERE YOU? NO.
- IF YOU HAVE ANY BOMBS LAYING
AROUND, I CAN DISARM THEM.
- COURTNEY MIGHT HAVE A LOT
MORE TROUBLE TRANSFORMING
A MANLY MAN, BECAUSE COURTNEY
ONLY WEARS CHAPSTICK
AND MASCARA.
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.
IT'LL BE HOT.
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE SAY.
"OH, SHE'S BEATING HER FACE"
MEANS THAT SHE'S DOING,
LIKE, A GOOD JOB
ON DOING HER MAKEUP.
- OK.
- YEAH, IT'S LINGO.
- OH!
- "I'M GONNA
BEAT YOUR FACE"--
IT MEANS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
- OH, NO!
I CAN DO YOUR FACE, BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEW.
- LIKE,
I ENVISION MY WEDDING,
LIKE, VERA WANG WITH, LIKE,
A NICE POOFY DRESS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S, LIKE, VERY ELEGANT.
- ELEGANT?
I'M NOT SURE IF SHE HEARD
ME WHEN I SAID I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SEW.
- ATTENTION, WOMEN.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BE
FITTED FOR YOUR SUITS FROM
HER TUXEDO.
SO KISS YOUR FELLAS, AND
SAY GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.
- I LOVE YOU.
- DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- LET'S GO GET SOME MATERIALS.
- OK.
- OH!
- HOW AM I WALK
IN THESE THINGS?
- POP YOUR HEAD THROUGH THERE.
AND THEN THIS ONE DOESN'T
QUITE HAVE A SLEEVE YET.
- OK, SO WE'LL JUST
PUT IT THROUGH
LIKE A LITTLE--LIKE
A MONK ROBE.
- YEAH.
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.
- IS IT GONNA HANG LIKE A
BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?
- I THINK COURTNEY HAS A
REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE
BECAUSE SHE'S USED TO DESIGNER
GOWNS MADE FOR HER THAT
ARE...(HIGH-PITCHED) THIS BIG.
(HIGH-PITCHED) HOW
ABOUT FOR THIS BIG?
NO.
- WELL, JUST SO
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
GONNA HIT ON YOU, BECAUSE
I'M NOT REALLY RECRUITING.
THERE'S ENOUGH GAYS IN THIS
WORLD, SO...AND NOW THAT THEY
CAN GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A MESS.
- I'M FROM HOLLAND, THE MOST
LIBERAL COUNTRY PROBABLY
IN THE WORLD, AND IT'S
VERY NORMAL FOR, YOU KNOW,
GAY COUPLES BE MARRIED.
- IN HOLLAND?
- OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW.
- THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SLOW
HERE, BUT LUCKILY ALL THIS
IS CHANGING.
- YEAH, PEOPLE ARE FREE TO DO
WHAT THEY WANT, YOU KNOW?
- OH, TOTALLY.
IT'S REALLY REFRESHING TO HANG
AROUND SOMEONE WHO'S STRAIGHT
WITHOUT ANY HANG-UPS.
I'M REALIZING I
REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
GIVING SOMEONE A HAIRCUT.
- VERY MUCH SO.
LOOK, I ACTUALLY MADE
A FRIEND TODAY.
ME. FRIEND.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HEY.
- LET'S GET THIS
BRIDAL PARTY STARTED.
- YAY.
- HI, JOSLYN.
- HEY, Ru-SIE Q.
- HI, BRANDON.
- HELLO.
- I KNOW YOU'RE A
BASKETBALL PLAYER.
- YES.
- TELL ME THIS.
WHAT WILL YOUR TEAMMATES
SAY WHEN THEY SEE YOU
ALL UP IN DRAG?
- DEVASTATING.
I DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IT.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IT?
- NOT RIGHT NOW.
- NOW, YOU'VE STRUGGLED
ON THE RUNWAY WITH THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
THEY'VE QUESTIONED
YOUR STYLE SENSE.
IT TENDS TO BE FROM THE
HOOCHIE COUTURE LINE.
- YES, 9 BIKINIS.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA ENSURE
THAT YOU DON'T WIND UP
IN THE BOTTOM AGAIN?
- WELL, THIS I'M
MAKING MYSELF.
WE'RE GOING FOR DEMURE.
- WHAT--EX-SQUEEZE ME?
- UH-HUH.
- YOU MEAN YOUR BUTT
IS GONNA BE COVERED?
- MY BUTT IS GOING
TO BE COVERED.
- HOW ON EARTH WILL
WE RECOGNIZE YOU?
- I'M KEEPING IT, YOU KNOW,
IN MY STYLE, BUT DEFINITELY
MORE SOPHISTICATED
AND POLISHED.
- YOU GONNA KEEP IT FOXY?
(BOTH MAKING
HONKING SOUNDS)
- ALL RIGHT,
GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS, Ru-SIE Q.
- WELL, HELLO, DARIENNE.
HI, DAMON.
- HEY, Ru.
- SO IT WAS YOUR WIFE'S IDEA
TO HAVE YOU COME ON "DRAG RACE"?
- IT WAS MY IDEA, ACTUALLY.
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA?
- YEAH.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
SO NOW, UM, SOMETHING
TELLS ME THIS IS
NOT GOING TO BE
A WHITE WEDDING.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- I THINK WE'RE TALKING,
LIKE, HORROR BOMBSHELL.
- YEAH,
AND WE'RE GONNA BE SORT
OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY,
IF YOU WILL.
- HUH.
- IF JIM MORRISON WAS GONNA BE
A DRAG QUEEN, IT WOULD BE ME.
- YEAH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA LET YOU KIDS
GET BACK TO WORK, OK?
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, ALEX.
HEY, BIANCA.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- WOW,
LOOK IT THERE.
THAT FABRIC IS
REALLY GORGEOUS.
- WE ARE GIVING
CLASSIC LADY LOOK.
- WHAT WILL BIANCA'S
BRIDE BE WEARING?
(GASPS) A BOATNECK GOWN.
I MEAN,
IT'S AMAZING,
BUT WE'VE SEEN IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO FEMINIZE THE FACE?
- WELL, I'M GONNA ASK
EVERYONE TO STEP BACK,
WHICH IS GONNA HELP...
A LOT.
YOU KNOW, JUST--JUST KEEP
SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BRIDE.
- I WILL SEE YOU OUT THERE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, Ru.
- THANKS, Ru.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER AROUND.
NOW, AS A THANK-YOU TO ALL
THE MAN BRIDES, I'M GIVING YOU
GIFT CERTIFICATES FROM KLEIN,
EPSTEIN, AND PARKER, THE FINE
MAKERS OF MY SUITS.
- WOW, THANK YOU.
- AND TOMORROW FOR YOUR
BIG DAY, GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- I HATE IT.
I NEED TO MAKE A SKIRT.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.
- OK, SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO
PUT AN OVERSKIRT, RIGHT?
WELL, PIN IT ON THERE FIRST
AND SEE HOW IT LOOKS.
- LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.
- HA HA HA HA!
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT
OPEN ON THE SIDE?
I'M ASKING.
- I DON'T KNOW.
OH, MY GOD.
- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT Ru.
I'M NOT A SEAMSTRESS.
I'M NOT FUCKING CINDERELLA.
I DON'T HAVE MICE TO COME HELP
ME MAKE THIS DAMN GARMENT.
- JUST START GLUING UP HERE
AND START CUTTING THE BOTTOM.
- YEAH.
- COMING UP...
- WOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A THRIFT STORE WIG.
- SEEING ADORE AND HER
DAUGHTER IS MAKING ME
FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT.
- FUCK YOU.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- OH, MY, THERE'S SO MUCH TO
DO FOR THIS WEDDING.
OUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO
TRANSFORM HETEROSEXUAL GROOMS
INTO BLUSHING BRIDES.
- DO YOU FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS?
- I GUESS.
- WOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A THRIFT STORE WIG.
[SIGHS]
- WOW, I LOOK
LIKE JOEY RAMONE.
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
A BLACK-HAIRED GIRL.
- OH, MY GOD.
- ADORE, YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER'S
GOT YOUR NATURAL HOG BODY.
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
- FUCK YOU.
- SEEING ADORE AND HER
DAUGHTER IS MAKING ME FEEL
REALLY CONFIDENT.
- WITH THAT FUCKIN'
HONEY MAHOGANY DRESS?
- BETTER THAN A
HONEY MA-HOG BODY.
- OOH!
- ADORE'S GUY IS A
LITTLE ALL OVER THE SHOP.
WELL, IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER, 'CAUSE HE'S
WITH ADORE, SO IT'S GONNA
BE A DISASTER ANYWAY.
- YOU PUT THIS STUFF
ON ALL THE TIME?
- MM-HMM.
- WOW.
- BRANDON IS A PROFESSIONAL
ATHLETE, AND GETTING INTO DRAG--
IT'S A HUGE LEAP FOR HIM.
- AM I GONNA BE SURPRISED
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR?
- MM-HMM. YOU'RE
GONNA BE SO PRETTY.
THE SECOND I PUT MAKEUP
ON BRANDON'S FACE,
HE IS NOT HAVING IT.
- I JUST DON'T--MAN, I DON'T
WANT MY TEAMMATES TO SEE ME
WITH HIPS ON.
- WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR TEAMMATES ARE GONNA SAY
WHEN THEY SEE YOU IN DRAG?
- OH, MAN, IT'LL BE POSTED
ALL OVER FACEBOOK.
YOU KNOW, THE LOCKER ROOM CHAT
THAT WE HAVE--IT'S GONNA BE
A DISASTER, MAN.
LIKE, IT'S JUST GONNA BE
SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONING.
- YOU JUST GOT TO BE SECURE
WITH YOURSELF, BRANDON.
- NO, I'M VERY SECURE
WITH MYSELF.
I JUST--IN MY PROFESSION,
IT'S NOT FUNNY FOR
A GAY PERSON TO,
YOU KNOW, COME IN
THE LOCKER ROOM.
I'D RATHER SOMEONE BE
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SAY,
YOU KNOW, "I'M GAY,"
YOU KNOW, IF THEY'RE IN
THE LOCKER ROOM WITH ME.
I DON'T WANT THEM, LIKE,
CHECKING ME OUT EITHER.
- IF YOUR INTENT IS THAT A GAY
MAN IN A LOCKER ROOM SHOULD BE
OPEN AS GAY BECAUSE EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS
THEIR SEXUALITY FREELY,
THEN THAT WORKS FOR ME,
BUT IF IT'S, "I WANT HIM
TO LET ME KNOW I'M GAY
SO THAT I KNOW
THAT HE'S NOT
LOOKING AT ME,"
OR "I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
BECAUSE OF THAT," THEN I
FEEL LIKE THE INTENT'S
A BIT DIFFERENT.
DOESN'T ENTIRELY
MAKE SENSE TO ME.
- I GET YOUR CONCERNS,
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS GONNA CHANGE PEOPLE'S
MINDS, ESPECIALLY
YOUR TEAMMATES.
- YOU THINK SO?
- I KNOW SO.
- I'M SO EXCITED.
- I'M EXCITED, TOO.
I REALLY AM.
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE MY
LITTLE GIRL'S GROWING UP.
- OH, SHUT UP.
- HE'S TALKING
SHIT ABOUT YOU.
- WHAT? WHO'S TALKING
SHIT ABOUT ME?
- FUCKIN' ADORE'S
DAUGHTER--HOG BODY.
- DON'T BLAME ME, DELANO.
- HOG BODY DELANO HAS
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT
MADAME DELACREME?
- SHE'S GOT A LOT TO SAY.
- WELL, LET'S HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR
DAUGHTER LOSE THE
CHALLENGE, HOG BODY.
[ALL GASP]
- THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH AT YOU.
THEY'RE ALL GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU.
STAY HOME WITH ME AND PRAY.
- YOU LOOK REAL PRETTY.
- AFTER THE MAKEOVER, JOSLYN'S
DRAG DAUGHTER--HE LOOKED LIKE
THAT ONE GIRL GREMLIN.
- REMEMBER THAT ONE GIRL
GREMLIN IN THE MOVIE?
DON'T THROW WATER ON
THAT GREMLIN 'CAUSE HE
WILL MULTIPLY.

- ALWAYS AND FOREVER.
- AND WELCOME OUR HANDSOME
AND TALENTED SUPER COUPLE,

- NO ONE DOES IT
BETTER THAN YOU, Ru.
- SO EXCITED YOU'RE HERE.
- WE'RE DIE-HARD
FANS OF THE SHOW.
WE WATCH EVERY SEASON.
- NOW, DAVID, YOU TWO HAVE
BEEN TOGETHER FOR 10 YEARS.
WHAT'S THE SECRET TO
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?
- OH, WELL, UM,
NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY.
- YEAH, I HAVEN'T
SLEPT FOR 6 MONTHS.
- (LAUGHS) THIS WEEK,
WE CHALLENGED OUR QUEENS TO
TRANSFORM GRUFF GROOMS
INTO BEAUTIFUL BRIDES.
ARE YOU READY TO WITNESS THE
DRAG WEDDING OF THE CENTURY?
- READY, RU.
- OH, YEAH.
- HOLLA.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY
THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- COMING UP...
- IT'S ALL JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF A MESS.
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING.
- BITCH, YOU'RE GOING HOME.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- NOW, SISSY THAT WEDDING.
["HERE COMES THE BRIDE"
PLAYING]
- HERE COMES THE BRIDE.
- WOW.
- MY DRAG DAUGHTER IS GLOWING
IN HER BIG, FRILLY WHITE DRESS.
WE ARE ONE FOXY LITTLE PAIR.
SHE CERTAINLY TAKES
AFTER HER MOTHER.
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- OH, MY GOSH!
- MY DAUGHTER IS
A GLOWING BRIDE.
WE'RE KIND OF BEING BRIGHT AND
LIVELY, SUNNY SOUTHERN BELLES.
MY HAIR IS HIGH AND CLOSE TO
GOD, AND I'M GIVING AWAY MY
DAUGHTER ON HER SPECIAL DAY.
- MY GOD. YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL.
- AW.
- OH, MY GOSH!
- MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE A
VISION IN YELLOW AND WHITE.
WE ARE GIVING MOTHER-DAUGHTER
DRAG REALNESS.
[PRETENDS TO CRY]
[LAUGHTER]
- HELLO, MY DARLING.
- OH, MY GOD. I DON'T
RECOGNIZE YOU AT ALL.
- MY BRIDE IS SORT OF
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
AND SHE'S TERRIFIED THAT HER
BOUQUET IS WHITE, SO I WHIP OUT
A CAN OF SPRAY PAINT
AND SPRAY THAT SUCKER BLACK,
LIKE MY HEART.
- YOU LOOK AMAZING.
- MY DAUGHTER IS A REBEL.
SHE SKIPPED SCHOOL TO ELOPE,
AND SHE BORROWED MOM'S OLD
LEATHER JACKET.
SHE LOOKS LIKE CHUCKY'S
BRIDE, SO IT'S A PARTY.
- YOU'RE SO TALL.
- MY DAUGHTER LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
I'M HAPPY WITH THE LITTLE WALK
WE CAME UP WITH, AND I'M JUST
HAVING A FUN TIME SORT OF
PLAYING THE MOTHER AND FUSSING
WITH HIM, MAKING SURE HIS
SKIRT'S STRAIGHT, MAKING SURE
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
LIPSTICK ON HIS TEETH.
- OOH.
LIKE A VIRGIN.
[SOBBING]
[LAUGHTER]
- DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE
GATHERED HERE TODAY TO
CELEBRATE THE JOINING
TOGETHER OF SOULS.
LET THIS JOYOUS OCCASION
REMIND US ALL THAT WE ARE BORN
NAKED AND THE REST IS LOVE.
- AMEN.
- OUR GORGEOUS COUPLES HAVE
WRITTEN THEIR OWN VOWS.
- BRITTANY, I
LOVE YOU, GIRL.
I LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE
YEARS THAT WE WILL SHARE
TOGETHER, AND I JUST LOVE YOU.
- BRADONNA, I'M THE
LUCKIEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
I VOW TO BE YOUR NEVER-ENDING
FOUNDATION OF LOVE
AND SUPPORT, AND NO MAN OR
WOMAN SHALL TEAR US APART.
- DAWN,
YOU ALWAYS WERE AND ALWAYS
WILL BE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
MY BEAUTIFUL QUEEN.
YOU'RE MY WORLD,
AND I LOVE YOU.
(WHISPERS) DON'T CRY.
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- YOU ARE MY WORLD.
YOU'RE MY HERO,
MY SOUL MATE.
I ADORE YOU, YOU BIG
BEAUTIFUL DRAG QUEEN.
- AS A BRIDE TODAY, I DO
HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS.
FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE SOME
MORE SPACE IN THE WARDROBE.
I'D LIKE A BIWEEKLY
MANICURE AND PEDICURE.
AND LAST, BUT CERTAINLY NOT
LEAST, I'D LIKE TO SCHEDULE
ADDITIONAL BEDROOM TIME.
- OK.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING ON
WITH YOU, MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.
FABULOUS.
- 35 YEARS AGO, I MET
YOU AT WONDERLAND.
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOU INSTANTLY.
BAM!
- WE'VE ROLLED THROUGH
THE PUNCHES LIKE WATER OFF
A DUCK'S BACK, AND WE WEREN'T
AFRAID TO SCREAM OUT, "WHERE
MY PEOPLE AT?"
- IF I'VE HAD IT OFFICIALLY,
AND YOU SEE ME FROWN,
JUST DRAG IT UP AND PUT
ON THAT SEQUINS GOWN.
- HALLELU!
- AMY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.
YOU MAKE MY LIFE HAPPY,
MEANINGFUL, AND COMPLETE.
I LOVE YOU
FIERCELY AND FOREVER.
- I LOVE HOW WE GROW TOGETHER,
HOW YOU MAKE ME LAUGH, AND HOW
WE WANT TO CHANGE
THE WORLD TOGETHER.
I PROMISE TO LOVE YOU,
TO BE YOUR FAITHFUL,
SUPPORTIVE PARTNER IN
SICKENINGNESS AND IN HEALTH.
I LOVE YOU
FIERCELY AND FOREVER.
- I BELIEVE EVERY LIVING
CREATURE IN THE UNIVERSE
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO
LOVE AND TO BE HAPPY.
THROUGH MY LIPSTICK AND
MY LASHES, THERE'S A HEART
IN HERE, AND THIS HEART
ABSOLUTELY ADORES YOU.
- I WAITED FOR 35 YEARS
TO MEET MY SOUL MATE.
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
A FEW DAYS INTO OUR
RELATIONSHIP, MY LEGS WENT OUT,
AND I WAS IN A
WHEELCHAIR, AND INSTEAD
OF LEAVING ME,
YOU STUCK BY ME.
FOR RICHER, FOR POORER,
FOR SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH,
I LOVE YOU FOREVER.
- WOULD YOU NOW
EXCHANGE RINGS?
DO YOU PROMISE TO LOVE,
CHERISH, AND HONOR EACH OTHER
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
FOR RICHER OR POORER,
TUCKED OR UNTUCKED,
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART?
- I DO.
- OH, I DO.
- I DO.
- I DO.
- I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MARRIED.
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- WHAT LOVE HAS JOINED TOGETHER,
LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER.
EVERYBODY SAY LOVE.
- LOVE!
- EVERYBODY SAY LOVE!
- LOVE!
- CONDRAGULATIONS.
WHOO!
- OH,
I CAUGHT IT.
I'M SO GOOD.
- YOU THROW LIKE A GIRL.
- COMING UP...
FIRST UP, JOSLYN FOX.
- WE GOT A RUNAWAY BRIDE.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- WELCOME, LADIES.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, JOSLYN FOX.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT BRANDON BEFORE.
WELL, HELLO,
BRADONNA FOX!
- WOW.
WELL, JOSLYN LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
GORGEOUS, BUT IT LACKS SOME
SORT OF UNITY BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU.
- YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER--
THE FACE IS NOT HER COLOR.
SHE LOOKS METALLIC.
IT'S REALLY OFF-PUTTING.
- NOT LOVING THIS
WHOLE WEDDING GOWN.
THE WAIST ISN'T GIVING US
THE DEFINITION THAT
WE WANT TO SEE.
- SO, BRADONNA, WAS THERE
ANYTHING YOU WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH?
- JUST MY MANLIHOOD
BEING QUESTIONED.
- AND WHO WAS QUESTIONING IT?
- NO ONE HERE, BUT IT
WILL BE QUESTIONED.
[LAUGHTER]
- THAT'S YET TO COME.
- REALLY?
- YEAH?
- WE GOT A RUNAWAY BRIDE.
- IS HE OK?
[BRADONNA VOMITING]
- JOSLYN, WILL YOU CHECK
ON YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER?
[BRADONNA VOMITING]
- NO, DON'T BE SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
- SO WHILE WE SORT THAT OUT,
WE WILL CONTINUE
WITH THE CRITIQUES.
- NEXT UP IS COURTNEY ACT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT STEVE BEFORE...
- WOW.
- AND AFTER AS RIEN ACT.
WUBBA, WUBBA.
DO YOU FEEL PRETTY?
- I FEEL HOTTER THAN MY WIFE.
- OH!
- YOU'RE GETTING A
BACKHAND FOR THAT.
WHY DID WE GO
WITH THIS LENGTH?
- UM, WELL, WE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE DOING,
LIKE, A LITTLE SOUTHERN
LOUISIANA WEDDING, AND, UM...
- YOU THINK
THAT SAYS LOUISIANA?
- I REALLY FELT THAT YOU'RE
THE BRIDE, AND RIEN ACT IS
YOUR MOTHER, IN A WAY.
- I'M LIKE THE COUGAR MOM AT
THE WEDDING WHO HITS ON ALL
OF THE DAUGHTER'S
SINGLE FRIENDS.
- UH, YOU'D SHOW ME UP
AT MY WEDDING LIKE THAT,
BITCH, YOU'RE GOING HOME.
- NEXT UP, BIANCA
DEL RIO AND ALEX.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT ALEX BEFORE...
- HUBBA, HUBBA.
- MM-HMM.
- AND AFTER, FIFI DEL RIO.
- I THINK THE
DEL RIOS NAILED IT.
- THE FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE IS ON POINT.
I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE
BIT OF A TRAIN IN THE BACK.
- I MEAN, HE WAS BATTLING
SHOES ALREADY AND EYELASHES
AND HIS BALLS AND HIS ASS.
I MEAN, DID I REALLY WANT TO
GIVE HIM A TRAIN, TOO?
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WORKING WITH BIANCA?
- IT WAS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU, MOMMY.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
DON'T CALL ME MOMMY
IN PUBLIC.
[LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE AND DAMON.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT DAMON BEFORE.
- WOW, UNREAL.
- NOW, DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL DO DRAG AGAIN?
- I MIGHT TRY
OUT FOR THE SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- MY WORD.
- IT'S KIND OF A RISK YOU
GOING AWAY FROM, LIKE,
A TRADITIONAL WEDDING GOWN,
BUT IT FITS YOUR PERSONALITY,
AND WE'RE FEELING YOUR
ENERGY, DEFINITELY.
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING,
AND I DIDN'T GET GOTH FROM
YOU EITHER.
YOUR OUTFIT TO ME SEEMS
A LITTLE COCKTAIL PARTY
DRESS TO ME.
- NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME AND KEVIN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT KEVIN BEFORE...
- ANOTHER BEARD.
- AND AFTER,
SUZETTE A LA MODE.
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
SEEN A LITTLE MORE OF THAT
KIND OF SEVERE ANGLE THAT YOU
DO ON YOUR OWN EYE MAKEUP.
LOVE THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL ON ALL THE ROSETTES.
OVERALL, WELL DONE.
- AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOUR WIFE HAS SEEN YOU
WITHOUT A BEARD.
- YES, EVER.
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 6 YEARS, AND I'VE
HAD THE BEARD FOR 7,
SO SHE'S NEVER SEEN
ME WITHOUT IT UNTIL TODAY.
- I BET SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO
THE HELL SHE WAS MARRYING.
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
RYAN BEFORE...
- MM.
- AND AFTERWARD AS
HONEY BUN DELANO.
- IT'S ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF A MESS KIND OF FOR ME.
I JUST WISH THAT THE OVERALL
EXECUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE ON POINT.
- NOW,
WHAT KIND OF BRIDE DID
YOU AND AMY WANT TO BE?
AFTER TALKING WITH ADORE,
WE DECIDED TO GO MORE
IN A PUNK DIRECTION.
- I LOVE THAT YOU WANT
TO PUT FUN INTO IT
AND STUFF LIKE THAT...
- YEAH.
- BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU WERE HER MOTHER AT ALL.
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE I SEE ANY
KIND OF A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.
I THINK YOU FAILED THAT PART.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK IN THE
FORMDECOR LOUNGE, THE JUDGES
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US IN-LAWS, LET'S START
WITH THE FOXES.
- THE DRESS WAS A DISASTER.
IT WAS LIKE SCHLUMP IN HEELS.
- I FEEL SO BAD THAT
BRANDON GOT SICK, BUT I KIND
OF WOULD'VE FELT THE SAME WAY
IF I LIFTED THE VEIL
AND MY FACE LOOKED LIKE THAT.
- HA HA!
- COURTNEY ACT AND RIEN ACT.
- OVERALL, THE
MAKEUP LOOKED GREAT.
THEIR HAIR LOOKED GREAT.
BUT THE OUTFIT THAT RIEN ACT HAD
LOOKED SORT OF LIKE A BEDSPREAD.
- I WAS SO AFFECTED BY THE
DRAG MOTHER STEALING ALL
THE LIMELIGHT--
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
- BIANCA DEL RIO
AND FIFI DEL RIO.
- THE DRESS WAS ON
POINT AND WELL DONE.
- I WOULD MISTAKE FIFI AS
A WOMAN IF I SAW HER
ON THE STREET.
- DAVID, YOU DON'T GET
OUT TOO OFTEN, DO YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT, DARIENNE LAKE
AND ANN DROGYNY LAKE.
- I LOVE THE GOTH KIND
OF EMO BRIDE.
- I JUST WISH DARIENNE
WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT FURTHER.
- IT MADE NO SENSE.
IT WAS EDGAR ALLAN POE MEETS
NEW JERSEY HOUSEWIFE MOM.
SHE WAS MY LEAST
FAVORITE OF ALL OF THEM.
- BENDELACREME AND
SUZETTE A LA MODE.
- THE TRANSFORMATION WITH
KEVIN WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
- BENDELA LOOKED GREAT.
THE COLOR WAS TERRIFIC ON HER.
- ADORE AND HONEY BUN DELANO.
- THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL IS NONEXISTENT.
ALL THAT BLACK UNDERNEATH THE
EYE--NOT FLATTERING, ROUGH.
ROUGH, ROUGH, ROUGH.
- AND I CAN'T EVEN SAY
SHE FOCUSED ON HERSELF,
BECAUSE THAT WAS A MESS TOO.
THEY WERE BOTH A DISASTER.
- SO, NEIL, OF THE
OUTFITS UP THERE,
WHICH ONE WOULD
YOU WEAR RIGHT NOW?
- OH, COURTNEY ACT'S.
- COURTNEY ACT'S.
- TOTALLY NUDE
WITH BUTTERFLIES.
- YOU SLUT.
- IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE SUCH A WHORE.
WE SHOULD GO
SOMEWHERE TOGETHER.
- HOW DARE YOU!
[LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK THE DIVORCE LAWYER.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
- MY HEART'S POUNDING
OUT OF MY CHEST.
- BENDELACREME, YOU GAVE
SUZETTE AND AMY A WEDDING
THEY'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER,
AND YOU LEFT US TICKLED PINK.
YOU ARE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YAY!
- BIANCA DEL RIO, WE LOVED
YOUR MAKEOVER SO MUCH, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- I KNEW IT.
- YAY.
- AND YOU'VE WON A TRIP FOR
TWO TO THE HONEYMOON PARADISE
OF HAWAII.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- AND SO HAS YOUR COUPLE,
ALEX AND EDDIE.
- OH, MY GOD!
- I'M GOING TO HAWAII.
HEH HEH HEH!
- ADORE DELANO, YOUR PUNK
BRIDE GAVE US A SERIOUS CASE
OF THE WEDDING BELL BLUES.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR, BUT
YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- OH.
- COURTNEY ACT, YOU MADE
RIEN ACT A BLUSHING
BRIDE, BUT WE
CAN'T SAY YES TO HER DRESS.
- YOU'RE SAFE.
- WHEW.
- GOSH.
- OH.
- DARIENNE LAKE, TONIGHT
THE BRIDE WORE BLACK,
BUT THE JUDGES WEREN'T
RAVING ABOUT IT.
JOSLYN, YOU ARE A FOXY
DRAG MAMA, BUT YOUR BRIDE'S
MAKEOVER NEEDED A MAKEOVER.
JOSLYN FOX, I'M SORRY,
MY DEAR, BUT YOU ARE
UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- OH, MY GOSH.
- DARIENNE LAKE, YOU ARE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
- THANK YOU.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME AND SAVE
YOURSELF FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME TO
LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I'M REALLY, REALLY
DETERMINED TO NOT GO HOME.
THIS SHIT IS
GONNA STOP HERE.
- GOOD LUCK, AND
DON'T FUCK IT UP.

- SO, YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AMERICAN.
- YES.
AND YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AUSTRALIAN.
- I WAS.
I WENT ALONG
THE FIRST DAY AS A BOY
AND I GOT KNOCKED BACK,
AND SO THEN I WENT BACK
THE NEXT DAY IN DRAG,
AND I MADE IT THROUGH
TO THE FINALS.
- HOLY CRAP.
- I WAS THE FIRST OUT GAY PERSON
AND THE FIRST PERSON IN DRAG
TO BE ON ANY IDOL FRANCHISE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
- I WISH I COULD'VE DID THAT.
- YEAH, BUT ADORE,
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU WERE SORT OF
THE AMERICAN COUNTERPART OF,
LIKE, THE FIRST REAL SORT OF
GAY PERSON ON "AMERICAN IDOL?"
- YEAH, BUT I WAS
KIND OF ADVISED
TO JUST NOT BE SO OUT THERE.
- SO, YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO, LIKE,
KIND OF KEEP YOURSELF--
- TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE.
- YEAH.
- RIGHT.
- SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T LIKING IT.
- MY MOM TOLD ME TO BUTCH IT UP
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM
MAKING FUN OF ME.
SHE SHOULD'VE JUST LET ME
GO OUT THERE WITH PINK HAIR.
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL.
- GIA, WHAT WERE SOME
OF YOUR TALENTS AS A CHILD
BESIDES TUCKING YOUR WEENIE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
- I ACTUALLY WAS DOING
THE DANCE FORM OF KABUKI THEATER
SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD.
IN JAPAN, KABUKI THEATER
IS ALL MEN,
BUT WE WOULDN'T, LIKE, GET
TUCKED AND, LIKE, PUT BOOBS ON
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
IN MY CULTURE,
IT'S NOT A GAY THING,
SO EVEN STRAIGHT MEN DO IT.
IT'S AN ART.
THIS IS LIKE WHEN I WOULD DO,
LIKE, THE BOY ROLES.
AND THIS IS ONE I WOULD DO
THE FISH ROLE.
- NO WAY!
- LOOKING GOOD.
- WITH MY THEATER BACKGROUND
IN KABUKI,
I DEFINITELY HAVE
A GOOD SENSE
OF STAGE PRESENCE
AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M REALLY HOPING
FOR THE BEST,
BECAUSE SOME OF US
AIN'T SINGERS, WE DANCERS.

LADIES, YOU REPRESENT

IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' REVIEWS,
STARTING WITH
TRINITY K. BONET.
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.
I LIKE THE WAY THE GOWN
ACCENTUATES YOUR HIPLINE.
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,
BUT I'M NOT ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.
IT'S KIND OF
A MUSH-MOUTH THING.
WE HEARD BIANCA,
AND THEN WE'D LOSE
YOUR LINE.
- IT'S ALL
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.
- YES, YES, BUT YOU ARE
IN THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG.
- BUT EVERY STAR WAS CRAP
BEFORE THEY BECAME THE SHIT.
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
PUT A CORK IN IT.
LITERALLY,
GET A CORK,
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH,
SPEAK WITH THAT CORK
IN THE MOUTH.
IT WILL DO WONDERS
FOR ENUNCIATION.
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE.
- LOOK AT YOU ALL PRETTY
IN YOUR POND SCUM GREEN.
- [LAUGHS]
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- AS FAR AS
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN GOES,
YOU GOT A LITTLE LOST.
- IT IS A LITTLE HARD
TO KIND OF CONTINUE ON
WITH A FIRE SIREN
BEING SQUASHED IN YOUR EAR.
- THAT'S GIA
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
- WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S SAFE AND YOU'RE HERE?
- 'CAUSE I THINK
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 3?
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
BENDELACREME.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE WAY YOU LOOK.
I BELIEVE THAT LESS
IS ALWAYS BEST.
LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF SOMETHING AWAY.
- OH!
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
NOW, YOU ARE WORKING IT.
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,
BUT I FELT THAT
YOU COULD'VE TAKEN IT FURTHER.
- I LOVED YOUR PORTRAYAL
OF THE VILLAIN,
LOVED YOUR EVIL
BETTIE PAGE LOOK,
AND YOUR VOICE, TOO.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- UP NEXT, COURTNEY ACT.
- THE ILLUSION
IS WORKING FOR ME.
A-MA-ZING.
AND YOU CAN REALLY SING.
FABULOUS.
- YOU ARE A STAR.
- THANK YOU.
- BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
REALLY NERVOUS IN REHEARSALS,
BECAUSE YOU WERE
MISSING CUES.
- I WAS MUFFLING TWO WORDS,
BUT I NAILED IT ON THE NIGHT.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- TONIGHT, THE DRESS,
FOR ME, COULD BE LONGER.
IT COULD GO TO THE FLOOR.
- WHY IS YOUR WAIST
NOT CINCHED
WHEN I JUST TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT THIS?
- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE, LIKE,
A "CINCHER" CINCHER, ONLY--
- BORROW A WAIST CINCHER
AND GIVE ME THE SILHOUETTE
I NEED FROM YOU,
ADORE DELANO.
- I'M A BETTER DRAG QUEEN
THAN I'M COMING OFF, I SWEAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- I LOVED YOUR VOICE.
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULD COMPETE
IN "AMERICAN IDOL."
- I DID.
- SEE THAT?
I GOT THAT IMMEDIATELY.
- PARTY.
- HA!
PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, APRIL CARRION.
- WELL, YOUR FACE
IS ALWAYS BEAT FOR THE GODS,
BUT I THINK YOUR SHADING'S
A LITTLE DARK
TOWARDS YOUR HAIRLINE.
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE
A BEARD ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
- APRIL, I KNOW YOU TRIED
REALLY, REALLY HARD
ON THIS CHALLENGE,
BUT YOU WERE WAY OFF.
- BEING THE BIG GIRL,
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SIZE.
IT'S MORE OF AN ATTITUDE,
AND YOU DIDN'T DELIVER
THE ATTITUDE.
YOU PUT SOME PADDING IN
AND THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD TRANSLATE,
AND IT DIDN'T.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, JUST BETWEEN US,
DREAM GIRLS.
- HMM.
- LET'S TALK OFF-BROADWAY.
LET'S START WITH
TRINITY K. BONET.
- DICTION, DICTION, I WANT
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING!
- NOW, WHEN TRINITY'S IN DRAG,
SHE WEARS TEMPORARY TEETH.
WE CALL THEM FLIPPERS
IN THE BUSINESS.
I'M WONDERING,
COULD THAT BE THE REASON
SHE'S UNABLE
TO PRONOUNCE HER LYRICS?
- FLIPPER OR NO FLIPPER,
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YES.
- AND BE OPEN
TO LISTENING TO SOMEBODY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
ALL "UGH" FACE.
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME
FOR THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE SEEMED TO GET
A LITTLE BIT
LOST IN THE SAUCE,
WHEREAS GIA,
FOGHORN OR NOT,
WAS GIVING IT ALL
WITH EASE.
DARIENNE DISAPPEARED
FOR ME.
- THE THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT.
- I INSTANTLY WAS TRANSPORTED
INTO A BROADWAY HOUSE.
- YES.
- AND I TOTALLY BOUGHT IT
FROM HEAD TO TOE,
BUT THERE WERE SOME CLUNKERS
THAT SHE HIT.
- I DIDN'T REALLY MIND
ANY OF THE NOTES
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A LITTLE OFF.
SHE REALLY NAILED
THIS PERFORMANCE.
- I LOVED THAT
FRESH-FROM-KANSAS,
FRESH-OFF-THE-BUS
LOOK OF HERS.
SHE WAS FABULOUS.
- BENDELACREME.
- KNEW THE CHOREOGRAPHY,
KNEW ALL THE WORDS,
LOOKED GOOD DOING IT.
- I REALLY LOVE
HER BODY LANGUAGE, AS WELL.
- YOU CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT HER,
THIS IS HER SHTICK.
- YEAH.
-BUT SHE ONLY TOOK IT
HALFWAY TO TONI BRAXTON.
- [LAUGHS]
- SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY.
- ADORE DELANO.
- ADORE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE,
BUT SHE CAN BE A LITTLE SLOPPY.
- ADORE WAS THE MVP FOR ME.
HER VOICE AND THE TONES
THAT WERE COMING OUT
OF HER MOUTH
MADE ME LOOK AT HER
IN A WHOLE OTHER LIGHT
OF BEING LIKE,
WOW, THIS IS A REAL TALENT.
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
APRIL CARRION.
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE TRIED REALLY HARD.
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE DID NOT
EMBODY THE BIG GIRL ROLE.
- WELL, THAT'S THE STANDOUT
ROLE OF THAT TRIO.
- YES, IT IS.
- AND IT HAS TO DELIVER.
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.
- SILENCE,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION,
GUYS AND DOLLS.
NOW, BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
THE NOMINEES
FOR BEST ACTRESS
IN A RUSICAL ARE...
COURTNEY ACT

BENDELACREME
AS SHADY LADY,
ADORE DELANO
AS BAD PENNY.
MAY I HAVE
THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?
THE WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE IS...

- THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU.
- YOU'VE WON
TWO VIP PACKAGES
FOR THE TONY-WINNING
BROADWAY MUSICAL
"KINKY BOOTS."
- OOH!
- LADIES, YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN ROUTINE
DIDN'T REALLY SHTICK
WITH THE JUDGES.
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOUR PAGEANT QUEEN PERFORMANCE
WAS NOT YOUR CROWNING GLORY.
APRIL CARRION,
IN THE ROLE OF THE BIG GIRL,
YOU MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF
MORE THAN YOU COULD CHEW.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU ARE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
TRINITY, APRIL,
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.

I'M VERY, VERY THANKFUL.

WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME,
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO PLAY...
SNATCH GAME!
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED.
THIS IS THE REASON
I CAME INTO THIS COMPETITION,
IS TO SNATCH
SNATCH GAME,
SNATCH THE TITLE.
- NOW, YOU'LL NEED TO BUST OUT
YOUR BEST CELEBRITY
IMPERSONATION.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- SNATCH GAME IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT CHALLENGE.
IT'S ONE THAT EVERYBODY
KNOWS IS COMING,
AND EVERYBODY'S KIND OF WAITING
ALL SEASON
TO SEE WHAT YOU PULL OUT.
BUT I DON'T DO IMPERSONATIONS--
THAT'S NOT EVER PART OF MY DEAL.
- THIS CHALLENGE IS THE ONE
THAT'S GOING TO SEPARATE
THE TALENTED
FROM THE OTHER ONES.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE, HON?
- TERESA GIUDICE, FROM JERSEY.
- WHO ARE YOU DOING, BABY?
- I'M GOING TO BE RACHEL ZOE.
- I COULD SEE THAT.
- YOU KNOW, WHEN TAY-TAY
WAS HER ASSISTANT,
BEFORE SHE TURNED BITCH.
I THINK THE KEY
TO A GOOD IMPERSONATION
IS NOT ONLY LOOKING
LIKE THE CHARACTER,
BUT SPEAKING IN THEIR VOICE.
[IMITATING RACHEL ZOE]
IT'S MAJ.
I'M NOT WORRIED.
- AND WHO ARE YOU DOING,
MISS BIANCA DEL RIO?
- CAN YOU TELL
FROM THIS HAIRDO?
- LET'S GUESS.
- SHE'S MY FAVORITE PERSON
IN THE WORLD.
- I'M JUST GOING TO GO
WITH JUDGE JUDY.
- JUDGE JUDY,
DING, DING, DING!
I LOVE HER.
I WANT TO BE HER.
THE REASON WHY
I'M CHOOSING JUDGE JUDY
IS BECAUSE SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S SENSIBLE,
AND SHE'S A FUCKING BITCH.
I LOVE HER.
I--I WATCH HER ALL THE TIME
BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME LAUGH.
- AND RUPAUL LOVES HER SO MUCH.
- OH SHE DOES?
- YEAH.
- SO, I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT "JUDGE JUDY"
IS RUPAUL'S FAVORITE TV SHOW.
HEH--PRESSURE?
SO, IT EITHER COULD BE
REALLY GOOD OR A HOT MESS.
- YEAH, YOU COULD FALL FLAT
ON YOUR FACE AND GO HOME.
- [CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY]
- BIANCA IS
A LITTLE BIT STRESSED.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
AT ALL SWEAT IN THE COMPETITION,
AND IT'S INTERESTING
SEEING HER KIND OF
WRIGGLE A LITTLE.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
- HI!
- HELLO!
- NO MORE FUN AND GAMES
OF THE MIND.
ADORE DELANO, DARLING.
- HI, RU.
- OKAY, THAT IS A BLONDE WIG.
- YEAH,
I'M DOING ANNA NICOLE SMITH.
- ANNA NICOLE SMITH!
- I LOVE HER.
LIKE, KIDS HAD SPICE GIRLS
ON THEIR FOLDERS,
AND I LITERALLY WOULD HAVE,
LIKE, THE "PLAYBOY" CUTOUT,
BECAUSE I WOULD STEAL IT--
NO, REALLY.
I THINK I IDENTIFIED
WITH THE FACT
THAT SHE WAS JUST VERY CRAZY,
AND SHE INSPIRES ADORE
A LOT, TOO.
- CAN YOU DO A SOUTHERN ACCENT
LIKE HER?
- I CAN!
- LET ME HEAR IT.
[IMITATING ANNA NICOLE SMITH]
- I WAS HONORED TO BE IN
OUR NEXT PERFORMER'S NEW VIDEO,
AND IF I EVER RECORD AN ALBUM,
I'D WANT THIS GUY
TO PRODUCE MINE,
BECAUSE HE'S FREAKING GENIUS.
I WOULD REALLY BE LETTING
DANNIELYNN DOWN
IF I DID NOT WIN THIS CHALLENGE.
- DELA.
- HI, RU.
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
DOING SOMEONE OLDER.
- IT IS.
I WILL BE DOING
MAGGIE SMITH.
- "DOWNTON ABBEY" MAGGIE SMITH.
- YES, YES.
- HOW WILL YOU MAKE
MAGGIE SMITH FUNNY?
- WELL, I THINK MAGGIE SMITH
IS ALREADY SUCH A CHARACTER.
- HMM.
- AND JUST, SORT OF, SHE'S BEEN
IN THE BUSINESS SO LONG.
- YEAH.
NOW, YOU DO AN ENGLISH ACCENT?
- UM, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ONE, IF I'M HONEST.
- WHAT OTHER CHOICES
WERE YOU MULLING OVER
BEFORE YOU SETTLED
ON MAGGIE SMITH?
- UM, WELL,
I WAS INITIALLY THINKING
ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUEENS
FROM LAST SEASON,
MISS ALYSSA EDWARDS.
- CAN I SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF YOUR ALYSSA EDWARDS?
G--
[GAGGING]
- WOW. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF COMPETITION.
THERE ARE VERY
TALENTED GIRLS HERE.
- RU DOES NOT SEEM INTO MY IDEA.
I'M SHAKEN--MY CONFIDENCE
IS DEFINITELY SHAKEN, BUT, I--
- COMING UP--
- I'D RATHER YOU HAVE
LOW EXPECTATIONS
SO I CAN BLOW YOU AWAY.
- WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
- AAH!
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- TODAY'S CHALLENGE
IS THE SNATCH GAME,
WHERE YOU IMPERSONATE ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES.
- LAGANJA GIRL.
- HEY, MAMA RU.
- AND WHAT'S WITH THIS HEADPIECE
YOU HAVE ON?
- OH, THIS OLD THING?
- [LAUGHS]
SO, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- I'M GOING TO BE PLAYING
RACHEL ZOE.
[IMITATING RACHEL ZOE]
SHE'S BANANAS!
- [LAUGHS]
I KNOW SHE'S GOT
SOME KEY PHRASING--
"LIT-ER-AL-LY."
- AND "I DIE,"
AND "MAJ!"
- NOW, ARE YOU QUICK
ON YOUR TOES?
- I'M VERY QUICK ON MY TOES,
AND I MUST SAY, YOUR OUTFIT
IS JUST TO DIE FOR.
- LITERALLY?
- LITERALLY.
- [LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS, RU.
- WELL, HELLO, MILK.
- HI!
- WHO ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- THE CHEF THAT BROUGHT
FRENCH COOKING
TO THE AMERICAN KITCHEN,
JULIA CHILD.
- OH, WOW.
SO, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE HER FUNNY?
- UM, SHE'S ALREADY
OVER THE TOP
BECAUSE OF HER SIZE,
BUT I'M GOING TO BRING
THAT OVER-THE-TOP
SORT OF PERSONALITY,
THAT IF SHE WROTE
A 730-PAGE BOOK
ABOUT FRENCH COOKING, AND--
I MEAN, SO--
I MEAN, SHE'S A SMART GIRL.
- HAVE YOU SEEN SNATCH GAME
ON OUR SHOW?
- WHAT SHOW?
I'D RATHER YOU HAVE
LOW EXPECTATIONS
SO I CAN BLOW YOU AWAY.
- WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HELLO, MR. RUPAUL.
- OH MY GOODNESS, I JUST SAW
THE JUDGE'S ROBE RIGHT THERE.
- YEAH.
- OH MY GOD.
JUDGE JUDY.
- JUDGE JUDY!
- ONLY JUDY CAN JUDGE ME.
- EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M SURE SHE WOULD!
- YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE--
- I--I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT YOU ACTUALLY LOVE HER.
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I WATCH "JUDGE JUDY"
EVERY SINGLE DAY--
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I'VE SEEN EVERY EPISODE.
SO, YOU KNOW, THE HEAT IS ON YOU
TO PULL THIS OFF.
YOU'D BETTER
DO MY JUDGE JUDY PROUD.
- FUCK!
- G-G-G-GIA!
- HI, RU.
- NOW, YOU KNOW SNATCH GAME?
- YES.
- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- WELL, NOT ONLY BE SNATCHED--
- UH-HUH.
BUT I'M GOING TO DO SELENA.
- SELENA?
- YES.
- NOT SELENA GOMEZ?
- NO, QUINTANILLA.
- SO--
- A LITTLE BEE-DEE, BEE-DEE.
- IS SHE FUNNY, THOUGH?
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE HER FUNNY?
- SO, YOU KNOW, SHE CRACKED,
LIKE, A FEW JOKES
HERE AND THERE.
BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,
REFERRING TO OTHER THINGS.
I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I'M VERY FLAPPY AT THE JAW,
I'M VERY USED TO,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
COMING BACK WITH READS, AND--
- I'M NOT BUYING THIS, GIA.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
GIVE ME A LITTLE SELENA.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE SELENA?
- UH-HUH.
"HOLA, TIENEN PREGUNTAS?"
- OKAY.
- GIRL, SELENA--WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH THAT?
I LOVE PIZZA,
I GOT SHOT BY YOLANDA--
LIKE, WHAT'S FUNNY?
LIKE, IT'S THE TRUTH, GIRL!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER AROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW,
ON THE MAIN STAGE,
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE CELEBRITY
YOU'LL NEED TO CHANNEL.
ME!
CATEGORY IS
"NIGHT OF A THOUSAND RUS."
- [APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD LUCK,
AND YOU BETTER WORK.
- [APPLAUSE]
- SUPERMODEL!
- ARE YOU STILL DOING SELENA?
- I'M NOT SURE.
I HAD THE SELENA COSTUME
READY ON MY MANNEQUIN,
BUT I'M NOW PROCESSING
RU'S COMMENTS,
AND KIND OF NOW THINKING
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE BEST CHOICE.
- WHO ELSE ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?
- BUT YOU'RE PLANNING
ON CHANGING IT?
- I MEAN, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
- CAN YOU CHANGE IT?
- YEAH.
- SO, GIA'S PUTTING ON MAKEUP,
AND DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK
SHE'S GONNA BE.
HOW THAT WORK?

ORDER IN THE COURTROOM, HUNTY,
IT'S JUDGE JUDY.
HEY, YOUR HONOR.

[LAUGHTER]
- UP NEXT, "PLAYBOY" PLAYMATE
AND REALITY TV PIONEER,
ANNA NICOLE SMITH IS HERE.

DEATH REALLY BECOMES HER.
[LAUGHTER]
UP NEXT, IT'S THE FRENCH CHEF,
JULIA CHILD.
- OH, HELLO, RU,
HOW ARE YOU?
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING COOKING.
DID YOU BRING YOUR LOVIN' OVEN?
- I SURE DID.
IT'S RIGHT UNDER THIS DESK!
- ALL RIGHT.
MOVING ON DOWN
TO THE FIRST LADY OF QUEENS,
FRAN DRESCHER IS HERE.
- ARE YOU SINGLE MR. RUPAUL?

MY GIRLFRIEND, VAL,
EVER SINCE OBAMA GOT INTO POWER,
SHE'S BEEN LOCO FOR THE COCOA.
[LAUGHTER]

YOU'RE WEARING?
- IT'S MY NEW FUR FAUX LINE.

THE QUEEN OF SOUTHERN CUISINE,
MISS PAULA DEEN IS HERE!
- MY, YOU GORGEOUS
BALD-HEADED MAN.
- OH, YOU SWEET THING.
- WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR FUZZ
DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T
A PEACH, HONEY.
[LAUGHS]
WHAT DID SHE JUST CALL ME?
MEDIA SENSATION
KIM KARDASHIAN IS HERE.
HOW'S THE BABY?
- OH, YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL, LIKE,
HAVING SOME MORNING-AFTER--
IS THAT--
YES, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
THROWING UP AND STUFF
AFTER THE PREGNANCY,
BUT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OKAY.
- KIM, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- AND LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S TERESA FROM "THE REAL
HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY."
HEY, GIRL.
- DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO PRONOUNCE MY LAST NAME?
- I DON'T,
I HAD A HARD TIME WITH IT.
- WELL, IT WAS JOO-DICE--
- UH-HUH.
- AND THEN, I REALIZED
IT WAS JOO-DEE-CHAY.
- UH-HUH.
- BUT WE WENT
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE OLD COUNTRY,
AND IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED--
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET IT.
JOHNSON.
[LAUGHTER]
- TERESA JOHNSON, EVERYBODY.
OKAY, WE HAVE TWO-TIME
ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS,
DAME MAGGIE SMITH IS WITH US.
HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR?
- WELL, PAST A CERTAIN AGE,
ONE JUST FEELS FORTUNATE
TO SEE THE SUN RISE ANOTHER DAY.
- YES, YES, MAGGIE SMITH.
- FOR NOW, LET'S JUST KEEP IT
MR. CHARLES AND DAME SMITH,
SHALL WE?
- YES, MA'AM.
- THANK YOU.
- NOW, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
PINK LADY,
NICKI MINAJ IS HERE.
- O-M-G. HI, RU.
- HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MARIAH AT ALL?
[LAUGHTER]
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE YOU READY
TO PLAY THE SNATCH GAME?
- OH, SHIT,
IT'S THE SNATCH GAME.
AAH!
- COMING UP--
- I'M SWEATING LIKE TWO RATS
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.
- BALONEY!
- THAT'S REALLY RUDE.
- I'M TALKING!
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO SNATCH GAME.
NOW, HERE'S HOW
THE GAME WORKS, LADIES.
I ASK A QUESTION,
OUR CELEBRITY CONTESTANTS
FILL IN THE BLANKS,
AND YOU GIVE AN ANSWER
THAT YOU THINK WILL MATCH.
FIRST UP, HEATHER MCDONALD.
CHER IS COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA.
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.
- I SAID, "EVEN HER WIG
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT."
- LET'S GO TO THE STARS
AND FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WROTE DOWN.
JUDGE JUDY.
- HER OLD NOSE.
- NOT A MATCH,
UNFORTUNATELY, BUT--
- SHE--IT HAS BEEN
LIKE 3 OR 4.
- YEAH, SHE'S BEEN TOUCHED
BY AN ANGEL.
- YEAH.
- AND SHE LOOKS GREAT.
- I AGREE, AND YOU KNOW,
I AGREE,
AND SO DOES OFFICER BYRD.
[IMITATING BYRD]
THAT IS CORRECT, JUDGE JUDY.
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.
- BALONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
BALONEY, SIR.
- I'M READY FOR A FRIED BOLOGNA
SANDWICH, MYSELF.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH.
- I SEE THAT HER HAIR
CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
- YES, IT DOES.
- AND IT HAS, LIKE,
A MIND OF ITS OWN.
- YES, IT DOES.
- SO, I PUT "HAIR,"
AND I THINK I WON SOMETHING.
- YES. YES, YOU DID.
[LAUGHTER]
- THAT'S A MATCH.
- YES.
- WHAT DO I WIN?
- WELL, WE'LL TELL YOU
IN A MINUTE, ANNA NICOLE.
- OKAY.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO RACHEL ZOE.
- I WROTE "SHOES,"
BECAUSE SHOES
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORY
TO A WOMEN'S OUTFIT.
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ME,
RACHEL ZOE,
TO GET YOUR SHOES STYLED.
- UH, RU?
- YES?
- IS THIS GIRL
OVER THERE A ROBOT?
WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE THAT?
IS SOMEBODY PUSHING A BUTTON?
CAN YOU TALK NORMAL?
- I'M ACTUALLY OVERWORKED--
- I'M TALKING, I'M TALKING!
AND, UM, I THINK
THAT'S REALLY RUDE.
- IS THAT REALLY
HOW RACHEL ZOE TALKS?
NO? OH...
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
- ALL RIGHT, DAME MAGGIE SMITH,
CHER, COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA,
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.
- WELL, RUPLE--RUPLE, IS IT?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.
- I UNDERSTOOD VIRTUALLY
NONE OF THE WORDS
THAT LEFT YOUR LIPS
MOMENTS AGO,
BUT I DID HEAR
THE TERM "TWITTER,"
AND I ASSUME THAT IT'S
SOME SORT OF SONGBIRD?
- VERY CLOSE, NOT A MATCH.
- AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ONE YANKS ONE'S TELEPHONE
RIGHT OUT OF THE WALLS
AND CARRIES IT WITH HIM?
[LAUGHTER]
- YES.
- RU, COULD YOU GET PEOPLE
THAT SPEAK NORMAL ENGLISH
NEXT TIME FOR THE SHOW?
- EXCUSE ME,
WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE!
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
GILLIAN JACOBS.
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
IS SO GAY,
INSTEAD OF HORSES,
THEIR MOUNTED POLICE
RIDE "BLANK."
- I SAID, "BEARS."
- WHY NOT RIDE A BEAR?
- I KNOW YOU LIKE A BEAR.
- I LOVE A BEAR.
- I'M SWEATING
LIKE TWO RATS
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.
- OH, DEAR.
- OH MY.
- LET'S SEE
IF YOU GOT ANY MATCHES
WITH OUR STARS.
JULIA CHILD.
- I HAD ALWAYS HEARD
THAT SAN FRANCISCO WAS--
THERE WAS A SAUSAGE FEST
ALL YEAR ROUND.
- YEAR-ROUND.
- AND SO, THEY MUST HAVE
ALL THESE TRUCKS
TO DELIVER THESE SAUSAGES.
- I'M SURE THEY MUST, YES.
- AND SO, I SAY,
"SAUSAGE TRUCKS."
- MILK AIN'T NO MERYL STREEP.
- ALL RIGHT, KIM KARDASHIAN,
SAN FRANCISCO IS SO GAY,
INSTEAD OF HORSES,
THE MOUNTED POLICE RIDE--
- WELL, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
YOU NEVER PUT A TATTOO
ON A BENTLEY,
AND I HOPE THAT I--
- A BENTLEY.
- SPELLED IT RIGHT.
- YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T.
- BEAUTY FADES,
DUMB IS FOREVER.
- UP NEXT,
WE'VE GOT TERESA
FROM "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF NEW JERSEY."
WHAT DO THEY RIDE?
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT A MATCH.
- CAN I HAVE A PINOT GRIGIO?
- PINOT GRIGIO, COMING RIGHT UP.
ALL RIGHT, NICKI MINAJ,
OH MY GOODNESS,
YOU'VE GOT A HAIRSTYLE CHANGE.
- YES.
- LOVE IT, THAT'S GORGEOUS.
- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO WRITE ANYTHING DOWN
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO CHANGE MY WIG.
- OH, OKAY.
- WIG CHANGES.
- HOW ORIGINAL.
CHAD MICHAELS,
HOW MANY YEARS AGO?
- YOU DIDN'T
WRITE DOWN ANYTHING?
- NO.
- PERHAPS SHE NEEDS ANOTHER POT
OF INK TO REPLENISH HER QUILL.
[LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, HEATHER.
THAT CHELSEA HANDLER
IS SO WRONG.
SHE'S LAUNCHING A NEW VODKA.
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- XANAX.
- XANAX. WHAT A GREAT IDEA!
OKAY, LET'S GO ON OVER
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH
TO SEE IF SHE MATCHED YOU.
- WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
A DRINKER.
- RIGHT.
- BUT I'VE TASTED VODKA
A COUPLE OF TIMES
IN MY LIFE,
AND I LIKE IT BY ITSELF.
- [LAUGHS]
- SO, I JUST PUT "VODKA."
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S NOT MATCH,
BUT THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER,
ANNA NICOLE.
- KIMMY!
[LAUGHTER]
- FRAN DRESCHER.
CHELSEA HANDLER'S LAUNCHING
A NEW VODKA FLAVORED WITH...
- I SAID "ALCOHOL."
[LAUGHS]
- I KNOW I CAN DO A BETTER
FRAN DRESCHER THAN COURTNEY.
OH, MR. SHEFFIELD.
HA HA HA HA.
- LET'S MOVE
ON TO KIM KARDASHIAN.
- NEW VODKA,
FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- I'D HAVE TO GO
WITH "BIG BLACK"--
- KARDASHIAN,
YOU WANT TO DATE HIM?
- YES, DEAR?
OH!
- SHE'S A REAL KEEPER,
AS IN "KEEP 'ER IN A CAGE."
- ALL RIGHT, TERESA,
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- CUMM-IN.
- OH, YOU MEAN CUMIN.
- CUMM-IN.
- YEAH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"CUE-MIN."
- CUMM-IN.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DAME MAGGIE SMITH.
- WELL, I'M UNFAMILIAR
WITH THE WORK OF LADY HANDLER,
HOWEVER, I DID THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE RATHER AMUSING
IF THERE WERE LIBATIONS
FLAVORED WITH CITRUS.
[LAUGHTER]
CAN YOU IMAGINE SUCH A THING?
- THAT IS REALLY NEWFANGLED.
I CAN'T IMAGINE SUCH A THING.
- YES.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, I'M SORRY,
TIME IS UP,
WHICH MEANS,
OUR WINNER IS...
WHO CARES?
THIS IS RUPAUL REMINDING YOU
TO SPAY AND NEUTER
YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
SAY "GOOD-BYE," STARS.
- BYE!
- Y'ALL COME BACK, NOW,
YOU HEAR?
- COMING UP--
SHE WAS REALLY CHANNELING HER.
- IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.
- IT'S THE TIGHTEST
SNATCH GAME IN HISTORY.
[LAUGHTER]
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- MEOW.
- TONIGHT'S RUNWAY THEME
IS "NIGHT OF A THOUSAND RUS."
WE HAVE TO DRESS UP AS RUPAUL,
WHICH IS EXCITING,
BUT RUPAUL
IS GOING TO BE IN THE ROOM, SO--
- AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S, LIKE,
HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH, LIKE, MY BODY?
MY FRIENDS AND I KID AROUND
ABOUT, LIKE--
WE CALL IT "HOG BODY."
JUST, LIKE, WE'RE REALLY THICK
IN THE MIDSECTION.
- DO YOU FEEL OVERWEIGHT?
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRD-PROPORTIONED BODY.
- WELL MAYBE YOU DO.
AND SO WHAT?
- YEAH.
I HAVE LOTS TO SAY ABOUT WEIGHT.
I WAS VERY HEAVY
ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL.
AND I WAS TEASED MERCILESSLY
ABOUT IT,
FOR BEING GAY AND BEING FAT.
IT AFFECTED MY SELF-CONFIDENCE
SO PROFOUNDLY.
I JUST FELT COMPLETELY UNLOVABLE
FOR SO MANY YEARS
BECAUSE OF THAT.
MY MOM, SHE'D BEEN
SORT OF THE BIG PROPONENT
OF ME BEING MYSELF,
AND THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL.
AND THEN, WHEN I WAS 13,
MY MOM DIED.
I JUST--
THAT REALLY THREW ME
INTO A TAILSPIN.
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT VOICE SAYING
THAT WHO I WAS WAS OKAY ANYMORE.
I JUST HAD A LOT OF VOICES
AT SCHOOL
SAYING THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME WAS WRONG.
TOO FAT, TOO GAY, TOO WEIRD.
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER EXPECTED
TO HAPPEN
WAS THAT I LEARNED A LOT
FROM MY DRAG CHARACTER
THAT I COULD BRING
TO MY BOY SELF.
- RIGHT.
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME
IN THOSE YEARS,
BUT I HAVE LEARNED
TO USE THE HARDSHIP
TO GET STRONGER.
- ADORE.
- YES, BABY?
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
YELLED AT BY MICHELLE,
BECAUSE DIDN'T
SHE SAY LAST TIME
THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE CINCHED?
- YEAH.
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.
- I'M DOWN.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.
- I'M REALLY GRATEFUL
FOR BIANCA'S
MOTHERLY KIND OF INSTINCT.
SHE'S KIND OF
MY STEPMOM, RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHING]
I'M A FOSTER CHILD.

- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE SNATCH GAME.
THIS IS SEASON 6.
YOU DON'T PICK A CELEBRITY
WITH NOT A BIG PERSONALITY.
IT WAS FLAT.
- WHEN I SPOKE WITH YOU
IN THE WORKROOM,
YOU WERE GONNA DO SELENA.
WHY'D YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?
- BECAUSE SHE IS NOT
A COMEDY CHARACTER.
- BUT THAT JUST DAWNED ON YOU
IN THE WORKROOM?
LISTEN, A LOT COULD BE FORGIVEN

FROM "KIDS IN THE HALL."
THERE WAS A LOT
OF THIS KIND OF--
- I AGREE.
- IT DIDN'T WORK.
- RACHEL ZOE IS KNOWN
FOR SO MANY CATCHPHRASES
THAT I MIGHT WRITE
A CHEAT SHEET.
- I DID.
- YOU DID?
- I DEFINITELY GOT
IN MY HEAD IN THIS ONE.
I SAW MY SISTERS
REALLY SUCCEEDING.
INSTEAD OF PUSHING
MORE FORWARD, I SUNK BACK.
- YOU'RE TALENTED,
SO IT HURTS TO SEE IT.
- IT HURTS ME, TOO.
- UP NEXT, BIANCA DEL RIO.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.
- [LAUGHS]
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR A QUEEN TO DO JUDGE JUDY.
IT WAS BRILLIANT.
- WELL IT DOES HELP THAT
I'M A JUDGMENTAL BITCH, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT DOES KIND OF HELP.
- YOU WERE ABLE TO INTERACT
WITH THE OTHER QUEENS.
IT WAS FABULOUS.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- THERE IS NOTHING RUPAUL
ABOUT THAT WIG,
NOR THE LOOK, QUITE HONESTLY.
- I WAS DOING ADORE
INSPIRED BY RUPAUL.
- YEAH, YOU WERE DOING ADORE.
AND I THINK THIS LENGTH IS GOING
TO BE A RUNNING THEME FOR YOU.
BUT I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR CINCHING YOUR WAIST.
IT CHANGES YOUR BODY COMPLETELY.
YOU NEED TO START DOING THIS
ALL THE TIME.
- I CAN FEEL MY HEART
IN MY THROAT,
AND IT TASTES AMAZING!
[LAUGHTER]
- YOUR ANNA NICOLE SMITH,
GUESS AD, '94 REALNESS
WAS PERFORMANCE ART.
- UP NEXT, DELA.
- I LOVE THIS YELLOW LOOK.
IT'S REALLY WELL-DONE.
- I DON'T EVEN WATCH
"DOWNTON ABBEY,"
AND I WAS DYING
OVER MAGGIE SMITH.
- YEAH, LIKE, WHEN YOU SAID,
"WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE,"
THAT WAS, LIKE,
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS
I HEARD ALL DAY YESTERDAY,
AND I THINK I SAID IT
ABOUT 6 TIMES AFTER I LEFT.
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- [LAUGHS]
- PART OF ME, MILK,
IS EXTREMELY OFFENDED
THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
ON THE RUNWAY IN PANTS.
PART OF ME THINKS IT'S GENIUS
BECAUSE IT IS RUPAUL.
- WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
WHAT I LOVE--
I LOVE GOING FOR THE UNEXPECTED.
- BUT THIS
DOESN'T SHOCK ME, REALLY.
WHAT WOULD SHOCK ME
IS IF YOU HAD COME OUT HERE
AND DONE SOMETHING
SO AMAZINGLY GLAM,
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.
- I COULD GO MORE GLAM,
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
STAYING TRUE TO MY AESTHETIC.
- BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU AS GLAMAZON.
- HONESTLY, SOMETIMES,
I DO FEEL THAT,
IF I WERE TO PUT ON
A BEAUTIFUL DRESS
LIKE THESE GIRLS
AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR LIKE THEM,
I WOULD STAND OUT
FOR THE WRONG REASONS,
AND PEOPLE WOULD
JUST LAUGH OF ME,
AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO LAUGH AT MYSELF.
- BUT IT'S HARD TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T SHOW
THAT VULNERABILITY
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF.
LADIES, THANK YOU.
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
RUPAUL IMPERSONATORS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S THE TIGHTEST SNATCH GAME
IN HISTORY.
- I AGREE, AND I SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT TIGHT SNATCH GAMES.
- I DON'T THINK SO, MICHELLE.
[LAUGHTER]
- LET'S START
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HER JUDGE JUDY,
IT WAS WELL-RESEARCHED,
SHE STAYED IN CHARACTER.
IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.
- BUT I DIDN'T THINK
THAT SHE WAS
THE BEST RU LOOK.
YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT IT
AND GO "OH, MY GOD,
THAT JUST REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF RUPAUL."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- WHAT SHE WAS GIVING
IS YOUR THIN BOD, YOU KNOW,
INTERGALACTIC LOOK.
YEAH, IT WASN'T ALL GOLD,
IT WAS PURPLE AND BLACK,
BUT I DIDN'T MIND HER LOOK,
TONIGHT, ON THE RUNWAY.
- FOR ME, HER RACHEL ZOE
WAS MORE WILLIAM SHATNER
THAN RACHEL ZOE.
- OOH, THAT'S HOT.
- RIGHT?
- I REALLY THINK THE NERVES
GOT THE BEST OF HER.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ADORE DELANO.
THAT ANNA NICOLE SMITH--
I WAS HYPNOTIZED.
I KNEW ANNA NICOLE SMITH,
AND SHE WAS REALLY
CHANNELING HER.
- BUT WHEN SHE CAME OUT,
SUPPOSEDLY BEING YOU,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
KIND OF STILL DOING
A LITTLE BIT OF
ANNA NICOLE, LIKE--
- [LAUGHS]
- I THINK SHE REALLY
HAS BEEN ACTING
LIKE ANNA NICOLE HER WHOLE LIFE,
AND THEN I DIDN'T THINK
THE IMPRESSION WAS AS AMAZING
AS I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE OTHER DAY.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.
- I THINK SHE WAS SUPERIOR
IN THE LOOK OF RU,
AND ALSO IN THE CHARACTER
OF MAGGIE SMITH.
- I WOULD AGREE.
HER COMEBACKS WERE SO FUNNY.
- BUT THE CON FOR ME WAS,
IT WAS ANOTHER OLD LADY.
- AH, THAT'S RIGHT,
THAT'S HER FORTE.
- NOT THAT IT WASN'T BRILLIANT,
BUT I FELT WE SAW IT ALREADY.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO GIA GUNN.
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
A HALLOWEEN COSTUME IN A BAG--
THAT WIG, AND THE
WONKY EYE WITH THE EYELASH.
- CRACK HO.
[LAUGHTER]
- AND COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A WORSE CHARACTER
TO DO ON SNATCH GAME.
- YOU COULD DO KIM KARDASHIAN.
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.
- I CONCUR.
WHERE WERE THE BOOBIES,
WHERE WAS THE ASS?
SHE COULD HAVE STARTED
EVERY LETTER WITH A "K."
- THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA,
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY.
- SHE JUST DIDN'T
REALLY GO FOR IT.
- ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, MILK!
- WELL, I COULD SEE THE WHEELS
TURNING EVERY MOMENT
OF THE JULIA CHILD.
- I THINK SHE MADE A REALLY
POOR CHOICE BEING BOY RU,
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TO SEE
ALL DIFFERENT SIDES OF A QUEEN.
- BUT I SEE THIS CONFLICT
IN MILK
BETWEEN WANTING TO STAY TRUE
TO THIS GENDER-BENDING,
WHICH I RESPECT,
BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME
I'VE HEARD A DRAG QUEEN
ON THIS SHOW SAY,
"I NEED TO STAY TRUE
TO MY DRAG,"
THEY GO HOME
VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER.
[LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
- TONIGHT,
IT'S THE PRIME
OF MISS BENDELACREME.
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.
- THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH.
- YOU'VE WON TWO COUTURE OUTFITS
FROM SYREN LATEX,
A LEADER IN LATEX FASHION.
- I'M THE FIRST ONE
TO WIN TWO CHALLENGES,
AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
THAT I WAS MOST TERRIFIED ABOUT,
AND I WON IT!
- BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE, YOU'RE SAFE.
MILK,
YOUR JULIA CHILD IMPERSONATION
WAS HALF-BAKED.
GIA GUNN, AS KIM KARDASHIAN,
YOU FELL FLAT ON YOUR ASS.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
YOUR RACHEL ZOE
WAS SO FASHION WEAK,
LITERALLY.
MILK, YOU ARE SAFE.
- THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT.
MILK BELONGS IN THE BOTTOM.
- BUT JUST BY THE SEAT
OF MY PANTS.
GIA AND LAGANJA,
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME,
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M IN THE BOTTOM TWO,
AND I'M UP AGAINST
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
IN THIS COMPETITION,
AND THAT REALLY SUCKS.

AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

I WOUND UP IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
- I NOTICED A LITTLE

I'M IN THE BOTTOM 3.
DID I THINK I OUTPERFORMED
COURTNEY IN THAT CHALLENGE?
YES.
I BLAME IT ON THAT GODDAMN
DOOGIE HOWSER

YOUR DAUGHTER
SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.
- DARIENNE'S NOT QUITE
LISTENING TO THE JUDGES
OR RU OR ANYONE
FOR THAT MATTER.
SHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE DOES
BETTER THAN SHE DOES.
SHE'S LIKE THOSE FRIENDS
THAT GO OUT WITH YOU
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"OH, THAT MAN'S LOOKING AT ME."
I'M LIKE, "NO,
HE'S JUST LOOKING AT
YOU HAVE A FUCKING BOOGER
ON YOUR NOSE, BITCH."
THAT'S CALLED DELUSION,

HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- NOW, IN THE HEAT
OF COMPETITION,
A LOT OF UNEXPRESSED FEELINGS
CAN GET BOTTLED UP,
SO FOR TODAY'S MINI-CHALLENGE,
I WANT TO DO SOME
THERAPEUTIC ROLE PLAYING,
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT...
WITH PUPPETS,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY
LOVES PUPPETS!
- AH!
- NOW, I WONDER
WHO'S BEHIND THAT WALL.
WELL, GLORY HOLE-ELUJAH.
IT'S THE SCRUFF PIT CREW.
- [WOOFING]
- FIRST UP, ADORE.
WHO'D YOU GET?
- DELA.
- YAY!
- YAY!
- MY EYEBROWS HAVE
NEVER LOOKED LIKE THAT.
- NEXT UP, BIANCA.
- I HAVE ADORE.
- ADORE.
- OH, SHIT.
- NEXT UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- [GIGGLING]
OOH!
[GASPS]
I GOT COURTNEY ACT.
- NEXT UP, DELA.
WHO'D YOU PICK?
- IT'S BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ALL RIGHT, COURTNEY,
GO ON OVER.
- I HOPE THE HOLE'S
BIG ENOUGH.
IT'S DARIENNE LAKE.
- ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET,
DRAG IT UP!
- BIANCA, YOU GIVING IT
A NICE HOG BODY?
- OH, YOU THINK?
- YOU ARE SO EVIL.
- DO YOU HAVE COURTNEY'S
COSTUME TOGETHER?
- I WAS HOPING THAT I COULD GET
SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE IT FOR ME.
- [GASP]
OOH!
- IT'S INTERESTING
THAT BIANCA,
WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN
ANY OF US DOWN,
GOT THE ABSOLUTELY
EASIEST TO PUPPET.
- I DID GET THE EASY ONE.
- OH, SHUT UP. WHAT IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
- IT'S NOTHING BAD.
YOU'RE JUST BASICALLY
ALREADY A PUPPET.
- OH, THAT IS SO RUDE.
- NO. BUT YOU'RE REALLY
EASY TO IMITATE,
WHEREAS BIANCA'S HARD TO IMITATE
BECAUSE I DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
- OH HO HO!
OH, MY GOD.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET THE BITCHFEST BEGIN.
- HI, BENDELACREME.
HOW ARE YOU?
- HONESTLY, LIKE,
I'M REALLY GOOD.
IT'S JUST
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE JUDGES SAY THAT
MY OUTFITS LOOK COSTUMEY.
- SO WHAT DO YOU USE
TO COVER YOUR EYEBROWS?
- OATMEAL.
- OH, FUNNY.
- I, UM...
I DON'T KNOW IF MY EYEBROWS
ARE REALLY THAT OATMEALY.
- I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO
COVER UP YOUR HOG BODY
IF YOU HELP ME BLEND.
- OK. I SWEAR, YOU'RE
AMAZING AND PERFECT.
- THANK YOU.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE, I'M REALLY NERVOUS
BECAUSE I'D THINK YOU CAN SEE
YOUR DIRTY PANTYHOSE.
- PARTY, FUCK!
I DO HAVE REALLY DIRTY TIGHTS.
THEY SMELL LIKE FEET.
I'M TOO PUNK TO WASH MY TIGHTS.
I FEEL SO COOL, COOL, COOL.
I'M A LIBRA.
COOL. FUCK. PARTY!
- WELL, COURTNEY,
I LOVE YOUR DRESS.
- THANK YOU, DAZZLE.
I'D LOVE TO COMPLIMENT YOU
ON SOMETHING,
BUT EVERYTHING YOU WEAR
IS SO DAMN HIDEOUS.
IT'S NOT THAT
YOUR CLOTHES ARE UGLY.
IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE MISSHAPEN.
- OK.
WOW, COURTNEY.
YOU COULD PROBABLY GLUE DOWN
THAT LACE FRONT THERE.
OH! NO, THAT'S JUST
YOUR SKIN THAT'S WRINKLED.
- WELL, I'M THE OLDEST
LIVING TWINK IN HISTORY.
- WELL, YOU GOT
THAT TWINK BODY.
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO
A COUPLE OF SQUATS
TO TIGHTEN UP THAT ASS.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A WALLABY.
- HI, DARIENNE. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. I'M DARIENNE LAKE!
- SO, DARIENNE, TELL ME,
HAVE YOU HAD A FUN TIME
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE?"
- I'VE HAD
A GREAT TIME, COURTNEY!
- WHAT'S BEEN YOUR
LEAST FAVORITE PART?
- HMM. PROBABLY
THE GUEST JUDGES.
- OH.
- NEIL PATRICK HARRIS HATES ME.
- OH. AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS BOYFRIEND?
- I TOLD HIM HE COULD USE $1.50
TO GO RIDE THE BUS.
- I'M FINDING IT REALLY HARD
TO MAKE YOU FUNNY, DARIENNE.
IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE.
- I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE INTERNET FOR SOME JOKES.
I DON'T HAVE ANY WI-FI HERE,
SO I'M FINDING IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO BE FUNNY.
- HI THERE, BIANCA.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
- TERRIBLE. THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES!
- OH. WELL, BIANCA,
WHAT A THING TO SAY!
- BALONEY!
- NOW, BIANCA, YOUR DRESS
LOOKS GORGEOUS TODAY.
- WELL, THANK GOODNESS,
BECAUSE I HAVE 50 OF THE SAME
DRESS IN DIFFERENT FABRICS.
- BIANCA, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FEELING
IN THIS COMPETITION.
- ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE
IDIOTS AND ASSHOLES.
ADORE'S AN IDIOT.
DELA'S GOT A STUPID VOICE.
SANTINO'S ASSHOLE IS LOOSE.
- OH, BIANCA, PET.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LACE FRONT
IS COMING OFF.
- BALONEY.
I HAVE NO PROBLEMS.
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
I WORK ALL THE TIME.
BALONEY. AAH!
ASSHOLES! AAH!
- NICE WORK,
MY LITTLE LAMB CHOPS.
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
MINI-CHALLENGE IS...
BENDELACREME!
- YEAH!
I KNEW IF I HITCHED
MYSELF TO THIS WAGON,
IT WOULD PULL ME SOMEWHERE.
- BALONEY!
FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
THE HOUSE OF RUPAUL IS THROWING
THE FIRST EVER...
GLITTER BALL!
YOU NEED TO SERVE
3 DISTINCT LOOKS.
FIRST CATEGORY IS...
BANJEE GIRL BLING.
SECOND CATEGORY IS...
PLATINUM CARD
EXECUTIVE REALNESS.
AND THE LAST
AND SHINIEST OF ALL
CATEGORY IS...
DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA.
- SO THAT MEANS THAT IT'S
ANOTHER COSTUME CHALLENGE.
HOLY SHIT.
- NOW, USING ALL THESE
SICKENING STONES
PROVIDED BY FIERCE!
DRAG JEWELS
AND MATERIALS FROM
THE FABRIC PLANET WALL,
I EXPECT YOU TO SPARKLE,
NEELY, SPARKLE.
BENDELACREME, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO ASSIGN
THE JEWEL TONES.
THERE'S DIAMOND,
RUBY, TOPAZ,
SAPPHIRE,
AND ROSE QUARTZ.
ROSE QUARTZ?
I THINK I WENT TO
HEBREW SCHOOL WITH HER.
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- WE HAVE TO
COME UP WITH 3 LOOKS.
ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE
FROM SCRATCH,
AND WE'VE GOT LIKE
A DAY TO DO IT.
- COMING UP...
- THE HEAT IS ON.
[GROANS]
- I JUST GET REALLY, LIKE,
DISCOURAGED AND,
LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- COME ON, DIAMOND.
OH!
- FOR TODAY'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
THE "ALL THAT GLITTERS" BALL.
WE NEED TO CREATE
3 DISTINCT LOOKS:
BANJEE GIRL BLING,
PLATINUM CARD
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,
AND DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA
IN OUR DESIGNATED JEWEL TONE.
- [GROANS]
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M JUST HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.
IN THE PAST, WE'VE HAD TO CREATE
ONE LOOK FOR THE RUNWAY,
BUT THIS IS 3 SEPARATE LOOKS.
EVERYBODY IS PRETTY WORRIED
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- I LIKE THIS TO START WITH.
- SHE'S KIND OF THE MARKER
YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT.
BECAUSE SHE HAS
THE SEWING SKILLS,
SHE CAN JUST BANG
THINGS OUT A LOT FASTER
THAN THE REST OF US CAN.
- THAT'S PRETTY.
- YEAH.
- FUCK OFF.
- SO WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT MADE YOU PICK ME
AS SAPPHIRE?
- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
ANY OF THE COLORS
WERE POSITIVES OR NEGATIVES.
I THOUGHT THE ONLY ONE
THAT WAS, LIKE,
SORT OF ESPECIALLY EASY
WAS DIAMONDS,
WHICH IS WHY
I THREW IT TO ADORE.
- REALLY?
WHY NOT JUST GIVE HER
CEMENT SHOES
AND THROW HER IN THE WATER
AND GIVE HER SOMETHING
REALLY ROUGH?
- BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT A EVIL CUNT.
- I MEAN, THIS IS A COMPETITION.
- SO, BITCH?
I WOULDN'T THROW YOU
UNDER THE DAMN OCEAN.
ONLY AN INSECURE BITCH
WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IT IS A COMPETITION,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SABOTAGE
ANYBODY ON THE WAY THERE.
- AM I BEING HATEFUL
BY SAYING THAT?
- NO, YOU'RE BEING REAL.
- AND THAT'S WHAT
I AM, A-REAL.
- AND YOUR REAL SELF
IS HATEFUL.
- ROWR.
- PEOPLE SAY THAT
I'M BEING MEAN,
BUT I'M IN THIS FOR
A CROWN AND $100,000.
YOU HELP YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU HELP OTHERS.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE THINGS
IN THE JEWELRIES DISTRICT?
- STONED.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE DELANO.
- HI, RU.
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
FOR YOUR DRIPPING
IN JEWELS ELEGANZA?
- I WAS THINKING OF JUST, LIKE,
BEJEWELING THE HELL OUT OF THIS,
BUT I WANT--I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE, LIKE, SO MANY IDEAS,
AND THAT'S THE THING.
LIKE, I THINK, LIKE,
OF SO MANY THINGS,
AND I JUST REALLY WANT
TO GET IT, LIKE, DONE.
- WHAT CAN YOU SHOW THE JUDGES
TO LET THEM KNOW THAT
YOU ARE TOP-3 MATERIAL?
- I JUST THINK, LIKE,
WHAT I HAD IN THE
BEGINNING OR WHATEVER,
LIKE, IT KIND OF GOT LOST.
I JUST GET REALLY,
LIKE, DISCOURAGED
AND, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
I DON'T WANT TO BE, LIKE,
THE CHIONA, LIKE,
THAT CRIES ALL THE TIME,
BUT IT JUST PISSES ME OFF
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SO
TALENTED, LIKE, IN OTHER THINGS,
SO I'M JUST, "WHY CAN'T,
LIKE, MY BRAIN, LIKE,
ALLOW ME TO MAKE
A FUCKING DRESS?"
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
- IT'S LIKE, I DON'T
WANT TO LIP-SYNC AGAIN.
I CAME HERE TO BE, LIKE, TOP 3
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE NOTES
THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU A LOT
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
APPLY YOUR GREAT THINGS,
LIKE IN THE RAPPING
OR THE SINGING.
YOU HAVE TO APPLY WHAT YOU HAVE
THERE INTO THE OTHER CHALLENGES.
PUT IT IN THIS FUCKING DRESS.
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YEAH, I DO.
- ALL RIGHT, ADORE.
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS. SORRY FOR
CRYING ALL THE TIME.
- EMOTIONS DON'T SCARE ME.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
- HI.
- I'M ON THE DL.
- MM. YO, YO.
- NOW, YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST,
THE JUDGES HAVE COME AFTER YOU
FOR THIS OR THAT.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES?
- YOU KNOW, I FEEL
I'M LISTENING,
AND I'M KIND OF
GETTING IT AND, LIKE,
TRYING TO REALLY
GROW FROM IT.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
AS LARGE AS I AM,
I STILL HAVE
ROOM TO GROW.
- DON'T WE ALL?
- MM-HMM.
- SO WHY IS IT,
DO YOU THINK,
YOU HAVEN'T WON
MORE CHALLENGES?
- I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE...
PARTIALLY, I THINK--
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU
WON MORE CHALLENGES?
- I KNOW. BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
A LITTLE SOMETHING OFF WITH ME.
- YOU GOT TO WIN SOME
CHALLENGES, YOU KNOW.
LOOK AT THOSE
FINE-TUNE THINGS
THAT YOU THINK THE JUDGES
MIGHT COME AFTER YOU FOR.
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- DELA.
- HI, RU.
- NOW, YOU HAVEN'T WON
A CHALLENGE SINCE SNATCH GAME.
- YEAH.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO GET TO THE TOP OF
THE HEAP THIS TIME?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
FOR YOUR ELEGANZA?
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THE FILM "WHAT A WAY TO GO!"
- OH, "WHAT A WAY
TO GO!" YES. UH-HUH.
- YEAH, AND THERE'S
ALL THOSE JUST, LIKE,
INSANE COCKTAIL-PARTY DRESSES.
I'M TRYING TO CHANNEL
THAT KIND OF FEEL.
- OH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- THE LAST TWO CHALLENGES,
I WAS, LIKE,
THIS CLOSE TO WINNING,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE SECOND
THIS TIME AROUND.
BIANCA CAN MAKE THE MOST
BROADWAY-RIFIC COSTUME.
I AM GOING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE SOMETHING
THAT THE JUDGES ARE
GOING TO BE WOWED BY.
- ALL RIGHT,
MY RHINESTONE COWGIRLS,
GATHER ROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW,
TWO OF MY EXTRA-FAVORITE
GUEST JUDGES WILL BE RETURNING.
THE SHINING STAR OF
TV's ROYAL FAMILY,
KHLOE KARDASHIAN,
WILL BE RETURNING...
AND FASHION'S MOST DAZZLING
DESIGNER EVER--
THE ONE AND ONLY BOB MACKIE.
- I ADORE BOB MACKIE.
HE'S DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE:
CHER, DIAHANN CARROLL,
DIANA ROSS, LIZA MINNELLI,
BARBRA STREISAND
IN "FUNNY LADY."
HE'S DONE EVERYTHING.
- OH, AND, UM,
JUST ONE MORE THING.
- OH, HERE WE GO.
- IN ADDITION TO CREATING
3 BALL LOOKS,
YOU'LL BE PUTTING ON
THE GLITZ
IN A FLAWLESS
OPENING NUMBER.
NOW, DELA, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF CHOREOGRAPHY.
- OH.
- THE ONLY TIME
I'VE SEEN DELA DANCE
IS DURING HER LIP-SYNC,
AND IF I RECALL,
SHE DID BEAR SIMILARITIES
TO A RUBBER CHICKEN.
- GOOD LUCK, MY PRECIOUS GEMS,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
COMING UP...
- I HATE THAT.
- WHAT IF WE DID THIS?
♪ RUBIES AND EMERALDS
AND DA DA DA DA ♪
THEN WE'RE ALL IN A ROW.
- WHY DON'T WE JUST DO
OUR OWN THING?
- UM, IT'D BE GOOD TO
JUST HAVE ONE BOSS, NOT 5.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- ♪ RUBIES AND EMERALDS ♪
- ♪ ALWAYS WEAR A JEWEL ♪
- LET'S GET THIS SHIT
OVER WITH.
- SO IN ADDITION TO
CREATING 3 LOOKS
FOR THE "ALL THAT
GLITTERS" BALL,
WE ALSO HAVE TO CREATE AND
CHOREOGRAPH AN OPENING NUMBER.
- UM, ALL RIGHT.
IS ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY, LIKE,
CHOREOGRAPHY-INCLINED?
- I CAN DO IT
AND DO IT EASILY.
- OK, IT'S DEFINITELY
A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BE IN CHARGE OF
THIS CHOREOGRAPHY.
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO GET
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET
FROM COURTNEY,
BECAUSE COURTNEY HAS DONE
MORE CHOREOGRAPHY THAN I HAVE.
- DARIENNE, DO YOU
WANT TO STAND HERE?
ADORE, DO YOU WANT
TO STAND HERE?
AND I THINK
IF WE'RE ALL ON PROFILE
LOOKING OUT WITH, LIKE,
OUR STOLES AROUND OUR NECKS,
AND THEN THAT'S
WHEN DELA WILL COME
SORT OF BURSTING-THROUGH-
THE-MIDDLE SORT OF THING.
- OK.
- WHAT IF WE DID THIS?
WHAT IF WE'RE ALL HERE,
AND THEN ON OUR LINES...
♪ RUBIES AND EMERALDS
AND DA DA DA DA ♪
THEN WE'RE ALL IN A ROW.
- OR WE COULD EVEN DO,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE HOUSE DOWN
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
GET RID OF OUR THINGS SO WE
DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON TO THESE.
- YEAH. COULD WE
JUST THROW THEM?
- UM, IT'S CHALLENGING
WHEN THERE'S 5 PEOPLE
TRYING TO CHOREOGRAPH A NUMBER.
LIKE, EVERYBODY'S THROWING
THEIR FEW CENTS IN.
IT'D BE GOOD TO JUST
HAVE ONE BOSS, NOT 5.
- ♪ FOREVER WEAR A JEWEL ♪
- OH.
- I HATE THAT.
- IT'S TOO FAST.
- THE ENDING SEEMS LIKE
WE DRANK CAFFEINE
AND WENT TO A ZUMBA CLASS.
- VERY THAT.
WHY DON'T WE JUST
DO OUR OWN THING?
- BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING
TO LOOK POLISHED AND...
- WE'VE ONLY GOT, LIKE--
WE'VE ONLY GOT A FEW MINUTES
LEFT, SO LET'S JUST GO...
- LET'S TRY IT.
- COURTNEY,
GOD BLESS HER SOUL,
BUT AIN'T NOBODY GOT
TIME TO BE LEARNING
HOW TO DO PIROUETTES
AND ALL THIS SHIT.
IT'S LIKE, "BITCH, I NEED
TO GET THIS DRESS DONE."
- REHEARSAL
DIDN'T GO SMOOTHLY,
SO NOW THE MOOD IN THE ROOM
IS JUST "FOCUS."
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR,
BECAUSE THIS CHALLENGE IS GONNA
DETERMINE WHO'S IN THE TOP 4,
AND THE ODDS ARE GETTING
NARROWER AND NARROWER.
- I HATE YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH.
[SIGHS]
- DARIENNE, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M HORRIBLE.
COULDN'T BE WORSE.
- WHAT HAPPENED, DARIENNE?
- WELL, I'M STARTING
OVER AT ZERO.
- CHANGING IT?
- YEAH. I HAVE TO.
I'M GOING WITH
A WHOLE NEW DRESS--
WHOLE NEW FABRIC,
WHOLE NEW EVERYTHING.
I DID A DRESS,
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY SAYING
"DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA,"
SO NOW I'M STARTING
ALL OVER AT SQUARE ONE.
WHAT THE FUCK
AM I THINKING?
I'M FUCKED.
- HOW YOU DOING
OVER THERE, ADORE?
- SO FAR,
I THINK SO GOOD.
SO AFTER TALKING TO RU,
IT'S FUCKING DEFINITELY GAME ON.
LIKE NUTS TO THE GUTS,
BALLS TO THE WALLS.
BUT I'M STILL NOT A SEAMSTRESS,
AND JESUS KNOWS THAT,
SO IT'S KIND OF
SO MUCH PRESSURE!
[GROANS]
I WANTED TO JUST
DRENCH THIS IN DIAMONDS.
- WELL, YOU HAVE
A LOT OF RHINESTONES.
- KIND OF, YEAH.
- WHAT ABOUT THAT PRETTY STUFF
UNDER YOUR TABLE?
- THAT?
- YEAH.
- I WAS GONNA USE THAT
AS A TUTU,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.
- WHY DON'T YOU
GATHER THAT UP?
- GATHER IT UP?
- WAIT. I'LL SHOW YOU.
WHAT YOU REALLY COULD DO IS
CUT IT EVENLY TO A LENGTH, OK?
AND GATHER IT ON TOP.
- UH-HUH.
- I THINK ADORE IS STRUGGLING
IN THIS CHALLENGE
BECAUSE SHE REALLY DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO EXECUTE COSTUMES,
MUCH LESS COUTURE.
SHE CAN'T EVEN SPELL IT.
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CUT IT IN STRIPS
AND JUST GLUE IT
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
- OH, NO, NOT LIKE THAT.
- IT LOOKS UGLY.
- YEAH, IT DOES.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
MAKE A FUCKING TUTU.
- I LOOK AT ADORE'S DRESS,
AND I'M LIKE, "OK, I THINK
I'M SAFE. THANK GOD."
- OH, YOU MEAN, LIKE,
WRAP IT AND THEN--
I DON'T FUCKING
MAKE CLOTHES.
- ADORE HAS BEEN IN THE BOTTOM
NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE.
SHE'S HERE BY THE SKIN
OF HER TEETH.
IF SHE CAN'T DELIVER
ON ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR RU
TO KEEP HER IN THE GAME.

- WELCOME, MY PRECIOUS JEWELS.
IT'S TIME FOR
THE JUDGES' APPRAISALS.
FIRST UP, BENDELACREME.
- I WAS CONFUSED
BY YOUR BANJEE GIRL.
I LOVED THE OUTFIT.
I'M INTO, LIKE,
HOOCHIE-MAMA IT UP.
I JUST DID NOT GET
THE TULLE.
IT WAS MORE DISTRACTING
THAN ANYTHING.
- AS FAR AS YOUR
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,
THAT'S THE ONE
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE GONNA RUN ANY BUSINESS
DRESSED LIKE THAT.
IT WAS A COCKTAIL DRESS.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN IT,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CATEGORY WAS.
- I'M ALWAYS HOPING
THAT YOU SURPRISE ME,
AND THIS WEEK,
YOU DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO,
DRIPPING IN DIAMONDS.
- FRIGGING ADORE.
- HI.
- FOR REAL?
- WHAT?
- YOU MADE ME SO HAPPY TONIGHT.
I COULD KISS YOU!
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE WE GONNA TONGUE?
- KIDS, THAT WAS HOW YOU DO
A BANJEE GIRL LOOK.
YOU KILLED IT.
- PHENOMENAL.
LOVE THE ATTITUDE.
I WOULD WEAR THOSE BOOTS
AND NOTHING ELSE.
- I DO. I VACUUM IN THEM.
- HONEY, I WOULD, TOO.
- THIS GOOFY THING
YOU HAVE ON NOW IS JUST PERFECT.
YOUR WIG AND YOUR SKIRT
ARE LIKE SISTERS.
THEY LOOK
THE SAME SHAPE EXACTLY.
I JUST LOVED THE WHOLE THING.
IT MADE ME REALLY LAUGH.
- SO DURING THE WALKTHROUGH,
YOU HAD AN EMOTIONAL
BREAKTHROUGH,
AND IT SHOWED ONSTAGE.
- WELL, THE THING IS,
I HAD AN EPIPHANY
WHEN I WAS TAKING A BATHTUB.
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIKE, NO MORE CHIONA SHIT.
YOU'RE IN SEASON 6."
- RIGHT.
- "IT'S GAME TIME."
FUCKING PARTY.
I'M EXCITED.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
BIANCA DEL RIO IN SAPPHIRE.
- THAT'S A GOOD DRAG NAME.
SAPPHIRE!
- I LIKE YOUR
EXECUTIVE OUTFIT.
I'VE KNOWN THAT WOMAN.
SHE'S REALLY ALL BUSINESS.
BUT THIS LAST ONE LOOKS, TO ME,
LIKE A BAR MITZVAH MOTHER.
I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE OFF
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE
RUFFLED THINGS.
- LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
YOU DID A SIMILAR SILHOUETTE
TO THE DRESS THAT
YOU'RE WEARING NOW.
I WISH I COULD SEE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE IN TOPAZ.
- THE BANJEE GIRL.
- WHAT?
- DARIENNE,
THAT WAS MORE RAVE.
LIKE, THERE WAS
NOTHING STREET TO ME.
EXECUTIVE REALNESS--
DIDN'T BUY THAT EITHER.
WHERE? JIFFY LUBE?
NOW, THIS LOOK--THAT TOPAZ COLOR
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME
IS THAT IT'S DROOPY.
- THOSE JEWELS ARE HEAVY.
- AND YOUR FABRIC
IS STRETCHING.
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
- I WAS GOING FOR THAT SORT OF
SLAVE PRINCESS LEIA THING,
BUT I ENDED UP LOOKING MORE LIKE
IF HER AND JABBA HAD A BABY.
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BECAUSE THE CONCEPT IS THERE,
BUT IT WAS JUST NOT A VERY
SUCCESSFUL SET OF LOOKS
THAT WE SAW FROM YOU TONIGHT.
- NEXT UP,
COURTNEY ACT IN RUBIES.
- YOUR BANJEE GIRL--
TO ME, NOT BANJEE.
WHAT WE GOT WAS, LIKE,
"ROCKER CHICK WEARING MY
BOYFRIEND'S FLANNEL SHIRT."
- I HAD GOLD BAMBOO
HOOP EARRINGS, MICHELLE.
- GIRL, BAMBOO EARRINGS
DOES NOT A BANJEE GIRL MAKE,
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA SHIMMY
AND SHOW US YOUR CAKES,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CAKES.
- THERE WAS PADS IN THERE.
- GIRL, IT WAS SO SMALL.
YOU NEED TO PAD MORE.
- OK.
- GO ROB A COUCH.
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE
OF THE ELEGANZA LOOKS.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
EFFORTLESSLY CHIC GOWNS
THAT YOU WOULD SEE
ON THE RUNWAY
OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT
DESIGNERS.
- LADIES, I HATE TO TARNISH
THIS SHINING MOMENT,
BUT I MUST ASK,
WHICH ONE OF YOU
SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT?
- OH, GOD.
- AND WHY?
COMING UP...
- SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- LADIES, I MUST ASK...
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHOULD
GO HOME TONIGHT, AND WHY?
LET'S START WITH DELA.
- I THINK DARIENNE.
EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE
HAS REALLY SHOWN AN ABILITY
TO HEAR CRITIQUE AND ADJUST,
AND SOME FOLKS, LIKE BIANCA,
JUST SAIL THROUGH,
BUT DARIENNE--
I THINK SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.
- ALL RIGHT. THANKS, DELA.
ADORE DELANO.
- I FEEL, BASED ON THIS
CHALLENGE, DARIENNE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
- IF IT'S ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE,
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY DARIENNE.
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU.
- I KNOW.
- WHICH IS WHY
I'M CALLED A BITCH,
AND APPARENTLY
I'M SAILING NOW.
- IS THAT A BAD THING?
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.
- WHY IS THAT AN INSULT?
- I SHOULD PICK YOUR ASS
JUST FOR BEING A CUNT.
- THAT WAS, LIKE,
YOU'RE GOOD AT STUFF.
- YEAH. NO, THAT WAS
VERY CONDESCENDING.
- DARIENNE LAKE,
SAME QUESTION.
- I THINK, "DARIENNE,
"YOU SHOULD REALLY GO HOME
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,
AND REALIZE THE CRITICISMS."
WHO I THINK SHOULD GO HOME?
WHOEVER DOES NOT LIP-SYNC
FOR THEIR LIFE.
- OK, COURTNEY ACT.
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,
I EARMARKED ADORE
AS BEING TOP 3.
AND OVER
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,
SHE'S KIND OF TRIPPED
AND STUMBLED,
SO I THINK THAT SHE
WOULD BE THE NEXT TO GO,
BUT I GUESS, BASED ON
TONIGHT'S COMMENTS,
I'M GONNA SAY DARIENNE.
- SO YOUR ANSWER IS
ADORE AND DARIENNE?
- [LAUGHTER]
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE "UNTUCKED" LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
JUST BETWEEN US RHINESTONERS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH BENDELACREME.
- WELL, YOU KNOW, WITH BENDELA,
MY ISSUE IS,
SHE'S NOT MEMORABLE.
I TOTALLY DID NOT EVEN REALIZE
SHE WAS IN THE OPENING ACT,
AND I THINK HOW SHE
MAKES STUFF LOOKS CHEAP.
- I AGREE. MOST OF WHAT SHE WORE
WAS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL.
I LIKED THE ROSE
QUARTZ THE BEST,
AND I DIDN'T
EVEN LIKE IT.
IT'S LIKE AN OLD
BETTY GRABLE OUTFIT.
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS CUTE--
KIND OF PONY,
SHOWGIRL LOOK FOR BENDELA,
BUT SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN
MANY TIMES BEFORE.
AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME,
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE EVER GONNA
GET ANYTHING DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN
FROM BENDELA.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S
MOVE ON DOWN TO ADORE.
- I LOVED ADORE.
ANYONE COULD WEAR AN OUTFIT.
NOT EVERYBODY COULD CARRY IT,
AND I THINK ADORE,
NO MATTER WHAT LOOK SHE DID,
SHE EMBODIED THAT PERSONALITY.
- I AGREE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT SO MUCH
THAT HER LOOKS
WERE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S,
BUT SHE SOLD THEM TO US.
- YEAH. IT WASN'T JUST
A GIRL IN AN OUTFIT.
I WAS AMUSED
ALL NIGHT BY HER.
- WITH THAT SAID,
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD
HAVE NOTICED ADORE
IN THE OPENING NUMBER IF SHE
HADN'T TRIPPED EVERY TIME.
- MOVING ON, BIANCA DEL RIO.
BOB, I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
LIKE HER SAPPHIRE DRESS MORE.
- NO, I DIDN'T.
IT WASN'T NEW OR INTERESTING
OR OLD-TIME GLAMOUR, EVEN.
I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.
- BUT THE THINGS
SHE DID THIS WEEK,
NONE OF THEM
WERE SO OFF THE MARK,
AND HER EXECUTION IS
ON POINT TO HER VISION.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE DID A GREAT
MARILYN MONROE,
AND THEN WE DIDN'T
SLOWLY DESCEND.
WE CRASH-LANDED.
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE
WAS THINKING FOR, REALLY,
ANY OF THE LOOKS.
THE BANJEE LOOK
IS SO UNFLATTERING.
- AND THEN THE SHOES WERE JUST
THE FRIGGING CHERRY ON TOP.
- WHERE DID YOU BUY THEM--
THE MICHELIN MAN SHOES?
- THROW THEM AWAY.
- BUT SHE'S GOT
A GREAT ATTITUDE.
SHE KNEW THAT
SHE HAD MISSED THE MARK,
AND I'D RATHER THAT THAN
SOMEBODY GO LIKE, "NO,
EVERYTHING I DID WAS GREAT,
AND I'M PERFECT."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.
LIKE, THE RED OUTFIT WAS
A PRETTY PIECE OF FABRIC
WITH A PRETTY BRA.
IT'S COASTING NOW.
- SHE DOES RELY ON THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHO SHE IS.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.
- $100,000.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.
- YOU KNOW, AS SIMPLE AS
HER ELEGANZA LOOK LOOKS,
IT TOOK TIME IN FINESSING,
AND IT WASN'T JUST...
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE SAYING THAT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LIKE,
"IT'S UNFINISHED, YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE A HEM."
- YEAH, BUT SHE...
- HE WANTS TO SAY--
WHATEVER I SAY, THE OPPOSITE.
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
I'M JUST SAYING--
I SAY WHATEVER,
BUT I REALLY FEEL
IT'S REALLY FUNNY
HOW YOU REALLY
DISLIKE THAT LOOK.
- I DON'T DISLIKE IT.
I JUST THINK IT'S BASIC.
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING ME MY JEWELS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO, TONIGHT
YOU HAD AN EPIPHANY,
AND WE HAD A BALL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE WINNER OF
THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU'VE WON
A DRAGTASTIC COSTUME
FROM KICKA CUSTOM DESIGNS.
- I JUST WON
A SEWING CHALLENGE.
I'M REALLY, REALLY
PROUD OF MYSELF.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
AS MARILYN,
YOU BOOP-OOP-A-DOOPED,
BUT ON THE RUNWAY,
YOUR ELEGANZA JUST DROOPED.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
BENDELACREME, YOUR CLASSIC
DELA SILHOUETTES
DIDN'T KEEP
THE GLITTER BALL ROLLING.
COURTNEY ACT,
YOUR BEAUTY IS FLAWLESS,
BUT YOUR OUTFITS
LACKED CLARITY.
COURTNEY ACT,
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
BENDELA,
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
- I HAVE BEEN IN THIS
EXACT POSITION BEFORE,
LIP-SYNCING AGAINST
DARIENNE LAKE,
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
SAVED A SECOND TIME.
SOMEBODY IS
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELVES
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

I'M SO EXCITED, I CAN PEE.
I DON'T FIT IN WITH SOCIETY.

CRAZY CUCKOO CUNT.
JUST GOT OFF THE BOAT.
YOU KNOW, LITTLE TRIP FROM ASIA.
JUST LANDED LIKE FRESH TILAPIA.
- [LAUGHS]
GIA CAME OUT WITH A HULA-HOOP
WITH A POCKET ON IT.
I MEAN, SHE WAS REALLY
LIVING FOR HERSELF, GIRL.
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA KIND OF BE, LIKE,
MAYBE THE MOTHERLY FIGURE.

[SIREN WAILING]
[ALL HOOTING]
- YOU GOT SHE MAIL.
- SHE MAIL.

THERE'S ONLY 7 OF US.
- THERE HAS TO BE
MORE GIRLS COMING.
- WHOO!
- DOES THAT MEAN
THIS IS ALL OF US?
WHO CAN COUNT THIS HIGH?
IS THIS ENOUGH?
- NO, HONEY.
THERE HAS TO BE MORE.
- WE INTERRUPT THIS KIKI
TO BRING YOU A SPECIAL BULLETIN.
THIS SEASON,
THE DRAG REVOLUTION
WILL BE TELEVISED,
SO DON'T ADJUST YOUR SETS,
BECAUSE THIS EXTRAVAGANZA

YOU ARE THE FIRST 7
QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
THIS WEEK, YOU'LL BE
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GOING HOME.
NEXT WEEK, IT'S PART TWO,
AS 7 NEW QUEENS ARRIVE.
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING BETTER
THAN ONE BIG OPENING
IS TWO BIG OPENINGS.
- YES, MAMA.
- THIS WAY, NO ONE CAN GET
LOST IN THE CROWD.

AND THERE'S A FUCKING CLOSER EYE
BEING WATCHED ON US.
I'M FUCKING SCARED.

YOU CAN WIN BIG.
THE WINNER OF
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"

- NOW, TO PROVE
YOU'RE NOT THE BIGGEST LOSER,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE A QUANTUM LEAP
AND STRIKE A SICKENING POSE
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS GIANT TV SCREEN.
- OH, SHIT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
FROM THE GIRLS IN THIS CHALLENGE
IS AMAZING FACE, DANCER-LY BODY
MOVES, AND CONFIDENCE.
- I'M REALLY SCARED THAT I MIGHT
FLY OFF THIS FUCKING THING,
AND HEELS ARE
GONNA GO FLYING HERE,
AND EYELASHES
ARE GONNA BE ON MY CHIN.
- ALL RIGHT, KIDDO.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
I'M GONNA TALK YOU
OFF THE LEDGE.
- THIS SHIT
IS NOT LIKE THE BUSINESS.
- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
- OKAY, READY?
- YOU'RE GONNA
COUNT IT OFF, RIGHT?
- OKAY, READY?
1, 2, 3.
- [LAUGHING]
- MY EYELASH.
- YEAH, THAT
WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD.
- OKAY.
- DO PRETTY LEGS.
LIKE, DO, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, A DANCER-LY THING.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- [YELPS]
- YOU DID IT AGAIN
WITH THE LEGS.
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M A GIRAFFE!
- ADORE LOOKED LIKE
HER LIMBS WERE ALL BROKEN,
BUT SHE GAVE
REALLY AMAZING FACE.
- THIS IS LIKE AN EPISODE
OF QUEER FACTOR.
BENDELACREME,
YOU'RE ON AIR IN 3, 2, 1...
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
[LAUGHS]
- YOUR BODY WAS GOOD,
BUT YOUR FACE
WAS A LITTLE EXTREME.
LET'S JUST DO A PRETTY ONE NOW.
- OOH, YES.
- OH, YEAH.
- HERE'S TO THE LADIES
WHO LAUNCH.
GIA GUNN.
- CHECK OUT
THE SIZE OF THAT SACK.

NOW, ON TODAY'S SHORT FLIGHT,
WE'LL BE SERVING FISH.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
[LAUGHS]
QUEEN DOWN.
- WAS THAT GOOD?
- WELL, NO, BUT YOU
CAN TRY IT AGAIN.
- OKAY.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.
I KNOW WE'RE TRYING
TO GIVE BODY AND MUG,
BUT I'M JUST SO SCARED
OF SNAPPING MY NECK.
- G-G-G-GIA.
[LAUGHING]
- WAS THAT BETTER?
- I REALLY THOUGHT YOU'D
BE BETTER AT GOING DOWN.
- [CHUCKLES]
- GIA MAY BE FISH,
BUT SHE AIN'T FLYING FISH.
- LAGANJA!
- YES.
- COME ON DOWN.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- YES!
- [LAUGHS]
YOU LOOK JUST
LIKE GOLDIE HAWN IN OVERBOARD.
- OH, I GET THAT A LOT.
- IF YOU CAN GO
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
AND A LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT.
- OKAY.
- QUEEN OVERBOARD.
- YES, GORGEOUS.
- SHE'S GIVING YOU
A YOUNG JULIANNE "HOWE."
- OH, YEAH, JULIANNE...
[COUGHING THROATILY] HOUGH.

- 1, 2...
3.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- OH.
- IT'S VERY DOROTHY
IN THE WIZARD OF OZ,
LIKE, WHEN SHE WAS
IN THE TORNADO.
- [LAUGHING]
- YOU GOT ONE MORE CHANCE.
- YOU GOT ONE MORE TRY.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE FOAM.
APRIL CARRION.
- TRES, DOS, UNO.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]

I AM LOVING
THIS NEW FALL SEASON.
- AH! I CAN'T GET OUT.
- IT'S THE BOOGIE
WOOGIE BUGLE QUEEN.
- WE TOTALLY GOT THE SHOT.
- VIVACIOUS.
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
I LOVE ABOUT YOU:
YOUR FACE.
- [LAUGHS]
- LET'S GO.
DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR THE HEAD
ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD?
- ORNACIA.
- ORNACIA, OKAY.
I BELIEVE YOU CAN FLY.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
OH, NO, YOU CAN'T.
- [LAUGHS]
- [GROANS]
- ORNACIA WAS GIVING ME FACE,
BUT YOU, NOT SO MUCH.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]
- OH, BOY.
ARE YOU OKAY?
- UH-HUH.
- WE GOT A GOOD SHOT.
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, MY GOODNESS. MISTAKE.
- YOU DID NOT JUMP
WITH THAT HEAD ON.
- YES, I DID, HONEY.
- NO!
- YOU GIRLS LOOK
DIFFERENT AS MEN, HONEY.
- YES.
- DELA DEFINITELY DOES NOT LOOK
THE SAME OUT OF DRAG.
I COULD NOT CLOCK THE SPOOK.
- WELL, I'M TRYING TO GIVE A
LOOK, STROLLING ACROSS THE ROOM.
- BUT GIA IS STILL
A LADY BOY IN OR OUT OF GEISH.
- I FEEL SO FREE,
LIKE FREE WILLY.
- LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM,
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG QUEENS.
VIVACIOUS AND I
ARE PROBABLY THE OLDER ONES.
I'M SURE SHE'S OLDER,
BUT, YOU KNOW...
- THIS IS, LIKE,
MY 21st YEAR DOING DRAG.
- 22 YEARS?
- 21.
- I HAVE BEEN IN DRAG
FOR 17 YEARS.
- OOH, YOU BETTER DO IT.
- YOU CAN NEVER
STOP LEARNING, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU NEVER STOP
STUDYING YOUR CRAFT.
- KELLY'S DRAG CALIBER
IS JUST NOT
TO WHERE I WOULD EXPECT IT
TO BE FOR AN EXPERIENCED QUEEN.
IF IT'S JUST NOT GIVING IT,
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT FOR YOU.
- THAT IS SO CUTE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
HOW IS SHE, THOUGH?
- GIRL, WHAT?
- HOW IS SHE, THOUGH?
- FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF.
ALL THESE GIRLS HAVE
THESE CRAZY RHINESTONE DRESSES,
AND I BROUGHT,
LIKE, FOUR GOWNS WITH ME,
SO THAT IS MAKING ME VERY
INSECURE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO!
- HI!
- I JUST FINISHED BINGE-VIEWING
YOUR ON-AIR PHOTOS.
- OH, HONEY.
- AND A COUPLE OF YOU FIZZLED,
BUT ONE OF YOU
IS A TRUE FALLING STAR.
THE WINNER IS...
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
[APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER]

ARE EVERYTHING.

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

YOU'LL HAVE TO SURVIVE
THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
- OH.
- THESE BOXES CONTAIN ITEMS
INSPIRED BY
SOME OF TV'S GREATEST HITS.
- YES.
- OKAY.
- NOW, USING THE JUNK
FROM ONE OF THESE TRUNKS,
YOU NEED TO CREATE YOUR BEST
HIGH-FASHION DRAG LOOK.
- OOH.
- LAGANJA, YOU
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO ASSIGN
ONE BOX TO EACH QUEEN.
- I'M GOING TO CHOOSE
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
- GOOD CHOICE.
- OKAY, MISS APRIL,
I'M THINKING,
BECAUSE OF YOUR ENTRANCE LOOK,
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE
"DUCK DYNASTY" AND MAKE IT WORK.
- [LAUGHS]
- OH, REALLY?
- "DUCK DYNASTY."
IS THAT FOR REAL?
[SIGHS]
- GIA, DARLING.
I'M GONNA GO WITH "KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS."
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT ABOUT VIVACIOUS?
- "THE GAME OF THRONES."
- OOH!
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ADORE?
- I'M WHISPERING "GOLDEN GIRLS."
LIKE...[WHISPERING]
"GOLDEN GIRLS."
- FOR MY SISTER,
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH
"HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO."
- OH, YOU FUCKING BITCH!
- REALLY?
- ANSWER "GOLDEN GIRLS."
- OH, SHIT.
I'M SORRY, MAMA.
- OH, NO!
IT'S FUCKED UP, MAN.
IT'S FUCKED UP.
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE
FOR KELLY MANTLE?
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO GO WITH THE "DOWNTON ABBEY."
- WELL, THAT MEANS
THAT BENDELACREME GETS...
"GOLDEN GIRLS."
- THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND.
- YES!
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- YES.
[APPLAUSE]
- OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE GOT?
- [GROANS]
- OOH, SHE GOT
SOME FEATHERS, GIRL.
- LAGANJA, YOU HOOKED ME UP.
- THANKS, MAMA, FOR BEING
SO FISHY TO THE FISH.
- IT'S ALL REDNECK STUFF.
IT'S CRAP.
I GOT A BOX FULL OF CRAP.
WHAT IS THIS?
CRAP.
LIKE, LITERALLY CRAP.
- HOW ARE YOU, APRIL?
DO YOU HATE ME YET?
- WHY WOULD LAGANJA THINK
I CAN RELATE TO THIS?
TOTAL CRAP.
[SIGHS]
- SHE'S FUCKED.
- SKETTI.
I'M NOT HAPPY THAT LAGANJA
GAVE ME "HONEY BOO BOO."
I'M SORRY.
THIS SMELLS SO GROSS.
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S HER STRATEGY.
I'M GONNA HEAVE.
AND IF SHE DID
THAT ON PURPOSE, THEN...
KARMA.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO!
- HI!
- HERE COMES HONEY RU RU.
- [LAUGHING] YEAH.
- ADORE.
- HI.
- DARLING.
YOU WATCH "HONEY BOO BOO"?
- I DO, BUT I WASN'T HAPPY
THAT I GOT THIS.
- YOU WERE ALSO A CONTESTANT
ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
- YEAH.
- HOW DOES THIS EXPERIENCE
COMPARE SO FAR?
- IT'S SO CRAZY.
- WAIT, WHICH IS CRAZY?
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- [LAUGHS]
- WHEN I WAS 17,
I APPEARED ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
I MADE IT TO THE TOP 13.
I'M PROUD OF IT, BUT I LOOK LIKE
A LESBIAN JONAS BROTHER.
- NOW, DO YOU SEW?
- NO.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU YOUNG QUEENS
WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEW.
I DON'T GET THAT.
- I KNOW.
I'LL GLUE IT OR SOMETHING.
- YEAH.
- I'M VERY, LIKE,
PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS.
- BABY, I THINK YOU'D BETTER
CHUG-A-LUG SOME GO-GO
JUICE REAL QUICK
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- [CRIES]
- VIVACIOUS.
- HI, RU, HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, DARLING.
NOW, "GAME OF THRONES."
YOU EVER WATCH THAT SHOW?
- YES, I THINK
IT WAS THE QUEEN'S DAUGHTER
WENT TO ONE
OF THE OTHER KINGDOMS,
AND SHE TURNED AROUND
AND HAD HER DRAGON TORCH
THE WHOLE KINGDOM.
SO, I'M JUST GONNA
TRY TO GET THIS AS FEMININE
AS I POSSIBLY CAN WITH A COWL
NECK AND A BABY DRAGON.
- A BABY DRAGON.
YEAH, OKAY.
WELL, WE WANT TO SEE
"GAME OF THRONES" TRANSLATED
THROUGH YOUR EYES.
GIRL, IT'S GOT TO SCREAM
"VIVACIOUS."
KELLY MANTLE.
- HEY, RU.
- YOU REMIND ME...
- UH-HUH.
- OF A YOUNG CAROL BURNETT.
- [SIGHS]
SHE WAS MY CHILDHOOD IDOL.
SHE'S THE WHOLE REASON
I EVEN STARTED PERFORMING.
- REALLY?
- OH, YEAH.
- SO YOU GOT "DOWNTON ABBEY."
I SEE SOME SORT OF ANTIQUE LACE.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR THE TOP?
- THIS WAS IN THE BOX,
AND I STARTED THINKING,
"THIS WOULD MAKE
SUCH AN AMAZING CORSET."
VERY KATE MOSS-Y.
- YEAH.
LISTEN, YOU USE
THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE...
- OKAY.
- AND BRING IT
TO THIS CHALLENGE.
- I WILL.
- APRIL. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, RU.
- YOU GOT "DUCK DYNASTY."
- YEAH.
I FOUND THESE PANTS.
- OH, YEAH, THEY'RE SORT OF
CAMOUFLAGE PANTS.
- I THINK I'M
GONNA REALLY TAILOR THESE
INTO A HIGH-WAISTED PANT
JUST TO MAKE IT HIGH-FASHION,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE A PANT CAN BE
HARD TO TRANSLATE
INTO HIGH FASHION.
- YEAH, IT CAN BE.
- YEAH.
- ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A MAN.
- WELL, I THINK
YOU NEED TO TAKE A RISK.
- HMM, OKAY.
- I'M SCARED SHITLESS.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE, YOU KNOW?
I CAN'T BE
THE FIRST QUEEN TO GO HOME.
- G-G-G-GIA.
- HI, RU.
- YOU GOT THE KARDASHIANS.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NOW, YOU SEEM
A LITTLE BIT BEHIND.
- I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I
HAVE THE IDEA TOGETHER FIRST.
- RIGHT.
- SO I'M THINKING, UM,
SOME TYPE OF COLLAR
AND MAYBE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, COMING UP HERE.
MAYBE SOMETHING FLOW-Y,
BUT I'M THINKING
I'M GONNA GO MAYBE,
LIKE, VERY GOWN-ISH.
MAYBE, LIKE, A DRESS?
- I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU...[LAUGHING]
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.
AND I'M WORRIED
THAT YOU DON'T EITHER.
- OOF, RU JUST CLOCKED ME.
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
I'M GONNA LET
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
GATHER ROUND.
LATER, YOU'LL BE
MAKING YOUR MAIN STAGE DEBUT,
AND WE'LL BE JOINED
BY OUR EXTRA SPECIAL
GUEST JUDGE,
MY AMERICAN IDOL, ADAM LAMBERT.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- THE STAKES ARE HIGH.
- I CAN'T EVEN THINK PROPERLY.
- GIRL. THE FIRST QUEEN
GOES HOME TODAY,
AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE
THAT GIRL.
- HOW DO YOU TAKE THIS OFF?
SO, I MAY HAVE OR MAY HAVE NOT
GLUED MY GARMENT
TO MY MANNEQUIN.
THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.
AAH!
I'M FUCKING RIPPING
MY WHOLE DRESS.
- YOU GOOD, BABY?
- GO AHEAD, BABE.
I'LL COME ONCE I GET IT.
- I MAKE ONE ATTEMPT TO HELP
THE BITCH GET THE ENSEMBLE OFF
OF THE MANNEQUIN.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE!
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK I'M GONNA DO.
THESE BITCHES ARE
BASICALLY READY AT THIS POINT.

HE WANTS SOME CHICKEN LEGS.
I KNOW IT.
- TAKING HER DUCK OUT
FOR A DRAG.
[LAUGHTER]
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SERVING
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
NOMI MALONE, SHOWGIRLS.
VERY QUEEN OF THE NIGHT.
WHITNEY, WHERE'S YOUR BODYGUARD?
OH, SHE'S GOING THAT WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
- THEY CAN'T HANDLE ME.
IT'S LEG FOR DAYS,
TRAIN FOR MONTHS,
AND FACE FOR YEARS.
- WHOA!
- HEY, SOLID GOLD.
KELLY MANTLE.
NOW, SHE'S DOING
"DOWNTON ABBEY."
- CHRISTINE BARANSKI'S
IN THE HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'VE GOT MY HAIR.
I'VE GOT MY MAKEUP DID.
I'VE GOT MY 28-INCH WAIST.
OKAY? I AM WORKING IT
LIKE A NINETIES RUNWAY MODEL.
- THERE'S SOME
KRISTEN WIIG-Y IN THERE.
- SHE GETTING WIIG-Y WITH IT?
- UH-OH, HEY.
- [LAUGHING]
- ADORE DELANO,
HONEY BOO BOO CHILD.
- HONEY CHILD.
- I'D BET $100,000
WOULD MAKE HER HOLLER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I'M SCARED.
I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING MESS,
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME,
SO I NEED TO SELL THIS GARMENT
LIKE IT'S
A 2004 HEATHERETTE SHOW.
- SHH, IT'S A WIG.
[LAUGHTER]
REPRESENTING
"THE GAME OF THRONES,"
VIVACIOUS.
- OOH.
- HEY.
- MARY J. IN THE HOUSE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
"GAME OF THRONES" IN THE 411.
[LAUGHTER]
- I AM WALKING DOWN THAT RUNWAY,
AND I AM SERVING IT DOWN,
MISS THING.
I AM GIVING YOU OLD-SCHOOL STYLE
NEW YORK WALK, WALK, WALK, POSE.
- WHAT TIME IS IT ON YOUR CROW?
- WELCOME TO HER QUEENDOM.
AIN'T NO RED WEDDING HERE.
- UH-UH.
- UH-UH.
BENDELACREME,
SERVING "GOLDEN GIRLS."
MICHELLE VISAGE.
- BITCH STOLE YOUR LOOK!
- [LAUGHING]
- BENDELACREME VISAGE.
- IT'S MY FIRSTBORN.
- I'M GIVING BENDELACREME
IN HER FULL GLORY.
I'M GIVING THEM THE SEX APPEAL,
BUT I'M ALSO GIVING THEM
THE CAMP AND THE FUN
AND THE GOOFINESS.
- CHEESECAKE.
- MMM, EAT IT.
- ♪ NOW, SISSY THAT WALK ♪
COMING UP...
- I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.
- YOU'RE TRIPPING.
- THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.
- HIDEOUS.
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, G-G-GIA GUNN.
- I THINK YOUR LOOK IS
WELL-ASSEMBLED.
YOUR HAIR IS FLAWLESS.
- I COULD TELL
THAT YOU'RE THE FEISTY ONE.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ONE THING I WANT YOU
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF: A BOOTY
WITH AN OPEN LEG CUTS YOUR LEG.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I LIKE THE BOOTY.
- THANK YOU, GIA.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- APRIL CARRION, I'M
VERY EXCITED THAT YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND
ABOUT THAT PAIR OF PANTS.
- THE PANTS WEREN'T FITTING,
AND I LOOKED
LIKE A CRAZY MAN, REALLY.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU DID A REALLY
AMAZING JOB AT TAKING
HYPER-MASCULINE ELEMENTS
AND MAKING A FEMININE LOOK.
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS.
- WELL, YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- GET A ROOM.
[LAUGHTER]
- UP NEXT, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HEY, GIRL.
- LAGANJA, YOU'RE
TRIPPING ON THE SKIRT.
- OKAY.
- ALSO LOST YOUR NECKLINE
COMPLETELY.
- RIGHT.
- I'M KIND OF LOVING HOW
YOUR HAIR BLENDS INTO THE TOP.
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- BUT I NEED MORE FISH
FROM YOU ONSTAGE.
I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.
- [OBNOXIOUSLY] OKAY.
- YOU ARE FILLED
WITH ENERGY, ARE YOU?
- YES, GO ON.
- THANK YOU, LAGANJA.
ALL RIGHT, KELLY MANTLE.
- IS THAT BACON ON YOUR CHEST?
- [LAUGHS]
- WHAT IS IT?
- THEY'RE FLOWER PETALS.
- I'M STILL GETTING BACON.
- I THINK I WAS FOCUSING MORE
ON THE HIGH-FASHION PART OF IT.
- BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS HIGH
FASHION LIKE WHITE POLYESTER.
THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.
- HORRIBLE?
- HORRIBLE.
- SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT THE MATERIALS,
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY FEMININE,
AND I LIKE THAT.
- ADORE DELANO,
TELL ME ABOUT THIS OUTFIT.
- WELL, UM...
I HAD A VISION.
LIKE, IF I WAS
AN EIGHTIES MERMAID
WHO GOT HER PROM DONE BY,
LIKE, HEATHERETTE
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED,
DIDN'T HAVE A SEWING MACHINE.
- [LAUGHING]
- JUST LEARNING HOW TO MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF SOMETHING.
[LAUGHTER]
- I THINK YOU
ARE SO FREAKING CUTE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH FABRIC
WRAPPED AROUND YOUR BODY
WITH A BELT.
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS OUTFIT.
THE EXECUTION OF THE WHOLE THING
IS NOT THERE.
- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT ONE LAST LOOK IN THE MIRROR
BEFORE YOU HIT THE RUNWAY.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
A NEW YORKER WALKS THE RUNWAY,
BECAUSE WE HAVE
THAT KIND OF BALL WALK,
THAT PEPPER LABEIJA KIND OF...
- OKAY.
- YES, HONEY.
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE THIS WEIRD
COMBINATION OF CAROL CHANNING
MEETS EDGAR ALLAN POE.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO COMBINE THOSE TWO.
YOU JUST DON'T.
- THE WORST PART
OF YOUR LOOK IS THE HEMLINE.
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU RAN OUT OF FABRIC.
- NEXT UP, BENDELACREME.
- DID YOU SEW THIS?
- I DIDN'T.
THIS IS ALL JUST
HOT GLUE AND DESPERATION
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
I WANTED THE CRAFTSMANSHIP TO GO
WITH THE GOLDEN GIRLS THEME
AND LOOK LIKE IT WAS MADE
BY OLD ARTHRITIC HANDS.
[LAUGHTER]
- IT'S COUTURE.
IT'S A CONCEPT.
IT'S STUNNING.
- ALL RIGHT, DELA,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORM DECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
JUST BETWEEN US--
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH GIA GUNN.
- I WASN'T THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED
BY THE ENSEMBLE
SHE PUT TOGETHER.
- I'M NOT TRYING TO BE SHADY,
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HER
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING.
- YOU KNOW, HER ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING WAS,
"OH, ABSOLUTELY," YOU KNOW,
BEFORE WE EVEN FINISHED
THE COMMENT.
- BUT SHE WAS ABLE
TO WORK THE GARMENT.
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT APRIL CARRION.
- I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE FACE, THE BODY,
AND ALSO THE OUTFIT
I THOUGHT WAS REALLY
HIGH-FASHION.
- SHE HAMMERED THIS CHALLENGE.
- FOR ME, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A FAN WHEN DRAG QUEENS
USE THEIR OWN HAIR, AND,
IF THEY DO USE THEIR OWN HAIR,
IT CAN'T HAVE
A MAN'S BUZZ CUT BACK THERE.
- I KIND OF THOUGHT
IT WAS KIND OF HOT.
- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FUCK HER.
- [LAUGHING]
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- THE THING AROUND HER HEAD
AND THEN THIS ELIZABETHAN COLLAR
AND THEN THAT SCHMATTA...
ON THE BOTTOM, IT WAS JUST...
[IMITATES DEJECTED TONE]
- I LIKED THAT IT WAS ODD.
THERE WERE CERTAIN PROPORTIONS
SHE WAS MAKING WITH HER HAIR
GOING INTO THAT COLLAR.
- BUT I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TOO HARD.
WITH HER PERSONALITY,
"UH-HUH, MAMA,"
YOU KNOW, AND, LIKE,
ALL OF THAT, IT'S JUST ANNOYING.
- RIGHT. YOU KNOW,
WHEN I SEE OLD FOOTAGE OF ME
FROM AROUND THAT AGE,
I'M TRYING SO HARD.
I WISH I COULD SIT MYSELF DOWN
AND GO, "JUST BE YOURSELF."
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO KELLY MANTLE.
- ORDINARILY EVERYTHING
IS BETTER WRAPPED IN BACON,
BUT NOT KELLY.
[LAUGHTER]
- FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,
IT WAS OFF.
THAT WAS A SHAKE-AND-GO WIG.
THE MAKEUP WAS TERRIBLE.
- SHE WAS VERY LACKLUSTER,
BUT, DESPITE THAT FACT,
I DO FEEL LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH.
- I AGREE.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S INTELLIGENT,
SHE'S FUNNY,
AND SHE'S A SEASONED QUEEN.
NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
NOW, HER OUTFIT WAS HIDEOUS.
- I THINK SHE'S GOT
THAT "IT" THING
THAT NOT ALL THESE GIRLS HAVE.
- SHE IS CHARMING,
AND SHE UNDERSTANDS
HOW TO DELIVER A JOKE.
- BUT IT WAS JUST A MESS.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- GIRL, I THINK THE HAIRLINE
STARTED DOWN HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
- WELL, SHE REPRESENTS
THAT REALLY UNDERGROUND
CLUB STORYLINE.
WAS SHE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT
INTO HER CHALLENGE?
- NO, I DON'T GET THAT AT ALL,
BUT THAT WALK WAS EVERYTHING.
- I WAS FASCINATED
BY HER CHARACTER,
AND I WANT TO SEE
WHAT SHE HAS IN STORE.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME.
- I WAS SO IMPRESSED
WITH WHAT SHE GLUED TOGETHER.
- I MEAN, THAT WAS
SNATCHED ON HER BODY.
IT WAS SO FITTED
ON HER HIPS AND HER WAIST.
- IT WAS LIKE A COUTURE GOWN.
- IT REALLY WAS.
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS
THIS CHARACTER THAT SHE DOES.
- SHE KIND OF HAS
A FIFTIES "I LOVE LUCY"
COMEDIC KIND OF VIBE.
- THAT PERSONALITY
CAN GET OLD REAL QUICK.
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY SQUIRRELS.
- [CLICKS TONGUE]
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
FIRST,
I WILL NOT BE GRANTING
IMMUNITY THIS SEASON.
PERIOD.
MAKE EVERY MOMENT COUNT.
GIA GUNN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- [MOUTHS] THANK YOU.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- APRIL CARRION...
YOU'RE SAFE.
BENDELACREME...
YOU WERE SERVING CHEESECAKE
AND LEFT US GAGGING FOR MORE.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- YES.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'LL RECEIVE
A CUSTOM JEWEL PACKAGE
FROM FIERCE DRAG JEWELS.
- [CHEERING]
- KELLY MANTLE...
YOUR RUNWAY LOOK...
WAS A LITTLE DOWNTON SHABBY.
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE DELANO, YOUR COUTURE
WAS A HONEY OF A BOO BOO.
VIVACIOUS,
YOUR RUNWAY STRUT
WAS PURE VOGUE,
BUT YOUR OUTFIT WAS VAGUE.
VIVACIOUS...
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I AM NOT GOING HOME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KELLY HAS,
BUT I KNOW ONE THING:
I KNOW HOW TO EAT A STAGE.
- GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

IT DIDN'T JUST BREAK TWITTER,
IT TURNED IT GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHS]
TONIGHT, ALL THE QUEENS ARE BACK
TO HELP ME CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
FIRST UP,
TWO DRAG DAUGHTERS
THAT POPPED OUT
OF MY TWO BIG OPENINGS.
[LAUGHTER]
A FUNNY QUEEN WHO COULD
BRING HOME THE BACON
BUT COULDN'T QUITE
FRY IT UP IN A PAN,
AND A QUIRKY QUEEN
WITH A NOSE FOR TROUBLE.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- YOU ALL READY
TO ROCK AND ROLL?
WHOO!
I AM AN ACTOR.
I'VE BEEN ON A BUNCH
OF TELEVISION SHOWS.
I HAVE BEEN IN DRAG
FOR 17 YEARS.
- IS THAT BACON ON YOUR CHEST?
- [LAUGHS]
- THEY'RE FLOWER PETALS.
- I'M STILL GETTING BACON.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- DON'T WEAR BACON.
DON'T WEAR BACON.
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- I VIEW MYSELF AS THE WORLD'S
MOST GLAMOROUS TRASH QUEEN.
THAT'S UGLY.
AWFUL.
I GOT A BUNCH OF SHIT.
- MY EYES HONED RIGHT IN
ON THAT NOSE CONTOUR.
IT IS SO DARK, GIRL.
- I'M NOT CHANGING THIS NOSE
FOR NO MOTHERFUCKING
MICHELLE "V-I-SAGE."
[LAUGHTER]
- KELLY MANTLE
AND MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD!
SO, KELLY, FANS PREDICTED THAT
YOU WOULD BE A FRONT-RUNNER,
BUT YOU ENDED UP
BEING THE FIRST TO LEAVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
- WELL, I CAN'T SEW,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
[LAUGHS]
- WELL, THAT'S A BIG ONE.
I MEAN, BUT YOU KNEW THAT IT WAS
GOING BE A SEWING COMPETITION.
- I KNOW, AND I KNOW
THAT I TOLD YOU
I TOOK COSTUME CONSTRUCTION
IN COLLEGE,
BUT I FAILED TO MENTION
I MADE AN "F."
[LAUGHS]
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- SO WHAT SURPRISED YOU
THE MOST?
- YOU KNOW,
WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST
WAS THAT THE JUDGES
WEREN'T HUNGRY FOR MY BACON.
[LAUGHTER]
- I MEAN, WHAT, IS EVERYONE
A VEGAN NOWADAYS IN L.A.?
JEEZ.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
THREW YOU SHADE
ABOUT YOUR NOSE CONTOURING.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK
THAT MY NOSE
WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL.
I GUESS, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I NOW CAN CALL MYSELF
"MAG-NOSE-LIA."
[LAUGHTER]
SO, THERE YOU GO.
- SO, MAGNOLIA,
WHICH OF THE CHALLENGES
WOULD YOU HAVE KILLED?
- WELL, I ACTUALLY...
I DID NOT WATCH THIS SEASON.
- EX-SQUEEZE-ME?
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
IN MY DEFENSE, IN MY MIND,
I HAD A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE,
AND DESPITE THE WAY
ANYTHING CAME ACROSS,
I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME,
AND I JUST WANTED TO REMEMBER IT
AS MY EXPERIENCE.
- HUH.
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY SPECIAL
TO ME, AND I WANTED
TO REMEMBER THAT.
- THAT...I AM NOT BUYING THAT.
YOU DIDN'T WATCH...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU CAN READ ME LIKE A BOOK.
[LAUGHS]
- I'M JUST NOT--
KELLY, I MEAN, COME ON,
TALK TO HER,
BECAUSE I AM OVER IT,
OFFICIALLY, OKAY?
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
- OFFICIALLY.
HONEY, LISTEN,
I HAVE ALL THE EPISODES
ON MY DVR, OKAY?
SO YOU COME OVER
SOME MORNING...
- WELL, AREN'T THEY ONLINE?
- WE'LL BRING PORK CHOP,
I'LL BRING THE BACON.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
NEXT UP, THE MOTHER
OF ALL CLUB KIDS,

VIVACIOUS IS LIVING ART.

THE HEAD ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD?
- ORNACIA.
- ORNACIA, OKAY.
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
A NEW YORKER WALKS THE RUNWAY.
- OKAY?
- YES, HONEY.
- REPORTING FOR DUTY.
APRIL CARRION IS IN THE HOUSE.
- YEAH!
- APRIL IS A CROSS BETWEEN
BJORK AND COCO ROCHA.
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WEIRD,
BUT SOMETHING GLAMOROUS.

MY SNATCH GAME.
I WAS GOING TO DO

SHE WAS PREGNANT.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, NICE, NICE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

MY BLACK AND WHITE LOOK.
IT'S INSPIRED BY "BEETLEJUICE."
I BET MICHELLE WILL CLOCK ME

HOLD UP, NOW,
BITCH STOLE MY LOOK.
[LAUGHTER]

AND I LOVE IT.
IT'S LIKE A CLASSIC RU LOOK.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF YOU.
- I LOVE IT.
SO, OVERALL, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY
IN THE COMPETITION?
- NO, LIKE, FOR REAL,
I'M REALLY HAPPY
WITH THE OUTCOME,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WASN'T
MEANT TO WIN THIS SEASON.
I'M MEANT TO WIN ALL STARS 2.
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ONE LAST THING,
AS WE GO TO BREAK.
VIVACIOUS, WILL YOU TEACH THESE
CHILDREN HOW TO WALK THAT WALK?
- YES, HONEY,
IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE.

LET'S SEE IT.
[DANCE MUSIC]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

IN THE OVERSTOCK.COM RED ROOM,
OUR TOP 3 NERVOUSLY WAIT

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S

WE ARE JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM FINDING OUT
WHO WILL BE CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
BUT FIRST, IT'S TIME
TO RECONNECT WITH TWO QUEENS
WHO LEFT US GAGGING
WHEN THEY SASHAYED AWAY.
TAKE A LOOK.
- MY NAME IS GIA GUNN.
GIA IS A FISHY GIRL.
SHE IS C.C.C.,
CRAZY CUCKOO CUNT.
I'M FEELING MY OATS,
LET ME FEEL MY OATS.
- I COULD TELL
THAT YOU'RE THE FEISTY ONE.
- ABSOLUTELY.

- I'M MILK.
I'M 25 YEARS OLD.
MILK IS A VERY CONCEPTUAL
PERFORMER.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO FIT IN
WITH THOSE GLAMOROUS QUEENS,
AND SO WHY NOT STAND OUT?
- BITCH, ANYBODY
THAT COMES DOWN THE RUNWAY
LOOKING LIKE THAT,
I WANT TO GET INTO YOUR BRAIN.
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- G-G-G-GIA.
ARE YOU HAPPY TO BE HERE?
- ABSOLUTELY.
- [LAUGHS]
NOW, GIA, I LOVE
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR,
BUT SOME PEOPLE
TOOK YOU VERY SERIOUSLY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO UNDERSTAND
THAT MAYBE SOME THINGS
COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
A LITTLE BIT THE WRONG WAY.
I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THEN, YOU HAVE ALLOWED ME
TO EXPAND MY HORIZON
AND BE ABLE TO VALIDATE QUEENS
LIKE MILK, JUST LIKE MYSELF.
[APPLAUSE]
- I LOVE IT.
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT GIA GUNN
THAT THEY DON'T?
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY?
THAT I'M REALLY JUST A HUMBLE,
REALLY NICE ASIAN GIRL
THAT JUST...
[LAUGHTER]
IS HERE JUST
TO TURN THE PARTY, SO...
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, MILK,
HOW HAS YOUR LIFE CHANGED?
- WHEN I WAS KICKED OFF
THE SHOW, I...
THANKS A LOT.
- [LAUGHS]
YOU WEREN'T KICKED OFF THE SHOW!
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU BOOTED ME IN THE BUTT.
- BUT YOU ENJOYED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?
- I SURE DID.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- I'VE QUIT MY BOY JOB,
AND AT THE END OF MAY
I AM GOING TO LIFE BALL,
A HUGE AIDS BENEFIT,
AND I'M SO EXCITED.
IT'S JUST A PARTY.
- THAT'S LOVELY.
AND YOU GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION
AS A BOY ON THE SHOW.
- HMM?
- WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT?
- REALLY? WHAT? REALLY?
- WHOO! WHOO!
- WELL, I GUESS I NEVER REALIZED
HOW HORNY "DRAG RACE" FANS ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, LIKE, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
ALIKE TELL ME HOW HOT I AM
AND HOW MUCH THEY WANT
TO SLEEP WITH ME.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
OH, SO IS THAT
HOW YOU QUIT YOUR JOB,
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING
ALL THESE COINS...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NEXT UP,
A QUEEN THAT CAME UNCORKED,
AND ANOTHER WHO HAD
A SECRET STASH OF DRAMA, MAMA.
- COME ON, SEASON 6,
LET'S GET SICKENING!
LAGANJA IS KNOWN FOR HER WILD
AND AMAZING DANCE ABILITIES.
COME ON, NATCH!
- YOU DO THIS "OKAY, OKAY."
- I DO TALK LIKE THAT,
AND I'M SORRY YOU--
- NO, NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS!
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK!
- I AM TRINITY K. BONET.
- GORGEOUS.
- I'M ABOUT AS CLOSE AS
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO BEYONCE.
NOW, IF I FUCK UP, IT'S BECAUSE
THIS IS NOT MY FORTE.
- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A BLOCK
THERE FOR YOU TO UNLOCK.
- STOP RUNNING
AROUND MY HOUSE LIKE THAT,
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN
MY LIGHT BILL UP.
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU HAVE OVERCOME
YOUR SABOTEUR,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
HOW ARE YOU, MAMA?
- WELL, MAMA,
I'M DOING VERY GOOD.
- OKAY.
- OKAY.
- WELL, YOU WERE CALLED OUT
BY THE JUDGES
AND THE OTHER GIRLS
FOR BEING FAKE.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
- WELL, NO, GIRL,
I HONESTLY JUST THINK
YOU ALL WERE BORING, AND I WAS
TRYING TO TURN THE PARTY.
YES, GONE!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, DID YOU FEEL ANY PRESSURE
TO LIVE UP TO YOUR DRAG MOTHER,
ALYSSA EDWARDS?
- WELL, YES.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
OF COURSE I FELT PRESSURE.
BUT I'M SO THANKFUL THAT I HAVE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
AND SOMEONE SO LOVING
TO MENTOR ME,
AND I REALLY LOVE YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
SINCE THE SHOW?
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
THE MINUTE I GOT ELIMINATED.
I GOT A SONG OUT, A MUSIC VIDEO,
A JEWELRY LINE, A MAKEUP LINE,
AND I'M ABOUT TO GO TO BRAZIL
FOR THE WORLD CUP, BABY.
- BUT, LAGANJA,
YOU'RE LEAVING SOMETHING OUT.
MY GUESS IS THAT YOU STOPPED BY
THAT WEED DEALER FIRST.
- OH, HONEY, YOU WONDER
WHY I'M CALM TONIGHT?
SHE'S MEDICATED.
AAH...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- LEGALLY, YES.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU, LAGANJA.
- THANK YOU, MAMA RU.
- NOW, TRINITY K. BONET.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
YES.
YOUR TRANSFORMATION MADE ME CRY,
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO DO,
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF BOTOX
I HAVE IN MY FACE.
[LAUGHTER]
EARLY IN THE COMPETITION,
YOU WERE SHUT DOWN.
WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU?
- IN PARTICULAR, BIANCA.
WHEN WE DID THE COMMERCIAL,
IT WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT HER ENERGY
SITTING AT THAT TABLE, WRITING.
I NEVER GOT THAT CLOSE TO HER
IN THE COMPETITION,
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE,
"PIECE OF CAKE, LET'S DO THIS."
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, WHAT PART OF THE SHOW
WERE YOU THE MOST PROUD OF?
- BEING BRAVE,
AND TELLING MY STORY,
AND BEING ABLE TO BE
A VOICE FOR PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THEY HAD A VOICE.
I CAN BE WHO THE HELL
I WANT TO BE,
AND NOBODY CAN QUESTION ME
FOR IT, BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE.
- RIGHT, RIGHT, I LOVE IT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, I KNOW YOUR DREAM
IS TO BECOME A BEYONCE
IMPERSONATOR, TRINITY,
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST KEEP ON BEING YOU,
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, TRINITY.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
NOW, FROM BEARDED LADIES
TO MERMAIDS,
FROM CLUB KIDS
TO PAGEANT QUEENS,
THIS SEASON,
THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF DRAG
RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
SO WE PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE
"HERSTORY" LESSON.
LEARN IT AND LEARN IT WELL.
WHAT IS DRAG?
DRAG IS UNDERGROUND
AND OVER-THE-TOP.
DRAG IS POLITICAL
AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT.
DRAG IS CAMP
AND COUTURE.
DRAG IS PUNK
AND MAINSTREAM.
DRAG IS A LAUGH RIOT,
AND IT COULD START A REVOLUTION.
DRAG IS NEVER HAVING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY,
BECAUSE DRAG IS ALL ABOUT BEING
WHOEVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO BE.

BENDELACREME AND DARIENNE LAKE

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME BACK
TO THE THEATER AT ACE HOTEL
AND "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE

NOW, THESE NEXT 3 QUEENS
MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN HOME
THE CROWN,
BUT THEY SURE SNATCHED
PLENTY OF ATTENTION.
THE FIRST ARRIVED WITH OPTIMISM,
A WINNING SPIRIT,
AND ONE HOT BODY-ODY-ODY.
- WHOO!
- JOSLYN FOX IS ALL ABOUT
THE LOOK AND SHOWING BODY.
JOSLYN FOX IS ONE FOXY LADY.
WA-WA.
- BAM!
- WHAT?
- THAT ASS IS SO PERFECT.
- WELL, HONEY, JUST BECAUSE
NOBODY IS INTERESTED
IN YOUR STYLE,
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT CAME
FROM THE FUCKING
QUINCEANERA STORE.
- LIKE, I KNOW
I'VE OVER-ACCESSORIZED.
THEY CAN LOVE IT OR SHOVE IT.
- HEY, MY LOVE,
IT'S YOUR FIANCE.
- OH, MY GOD!
- YOU'RE MY ROCK,
AND I SUPPORT YOU 100%.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR GUTS.
- AW.
- I PLAN ON BEING THE BLACK
HORSE IN THIS COMPETITION.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- OH, IT IS DARK HORSE,
ISN'T IT?
- HELLO, JOSLYN FOX.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- HI, RU, HOW ARE YOU?
[LAUGHS]
- SO, I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOUR FAMILY REACTED
TO YOU SHOWING ALL THAT ASS.
- OOH, I THINK
THEY'RE USED TO IT.
[LAUGHTER]
- THEY'VE SEEN IT BEFORE,
IT WAS NOTHING NEW.
[LAUGHS]
- HAS THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES
CHANGED YOUR DRAG?
- VERY MUCH SO.
I WEAR MORE ACCESSORIES.
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
SO, WHAT ADVICE
DO YOU HAVE FOR QUEENS
WHO HAVE AUDITIONED
YEAR AFTER YEAR, LIKE YOU DID?
- YOU KNOW, THIS WAS
MY FOURTH TIME AUDITIONING,
AND I THINK THE FIRST FEW TIMES
I WAS MAKING A STRONG EFFORT
TO GIVE YOU
WHAT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED,
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS
AUDITION THAT I JUST SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GOING TO BE ME."
SO MY ADVICE IS TO ALWAYS
STAY TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOUR SHINING
PERSONALITY WILL COME THROUGH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
AND WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
KEEP IT FOXY.
WA-WA.
[LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELL, WA-WA.
THANK YOU, JOSLYN.
[LAUGHS]
- THANK YOU, RU-ZIE-Q.
- UP NEXT, A BURLESQUE BABE
AND A GORGEOUS GAL
WITH PLUS-SIZED TALENTS.
LET'S WATCH.
- BENDELACREME IS EFFERVESCENT
AND OPTIMISTIC.
I REFER TO HER
AS "TERMINALLY DELIGHTFUL."
OOH!
- BENDELACREME VISAGE.
- BITCH STOLE YOUR LOOK!
- [LAUGHS]
I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME, WE'RE
HIDING BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
- I UNDERSTOOD VIRTUALLY
NONE OF THE WORDS
THAT LEFT YOUR LIPS MOMENTS AGO.
- [LAUGHS]
- I REALLY FEEL
SOME PSYCHIC ENERGY
BETWEEN DELA AND DARIENNE.
- YOU REMIND ME
OF A RUSSIAN DOLL.
FULL OF YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, DARIENNE,
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR GROUP?
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
[ALL GASP]
- DIP INTO THE WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.
- I WAS PICKED FAN FAVORITE
ON THE ONLINE FACEBOOK CONTEST.
- SHE'S A FIERCE LIP-SYNCER,
ALL ABOUT SELLING FACE.
- YOUR MOTHER
DARNS SOCKS IN HELL! HA HA!
- YOU WERE THROWN OUT OF
THE HOUSE AS A KID, WEREN'T YOU?
- IT WAS MORE LIKE
AN INVITATION TO LEAVE.
THERE WAS A LOT OF YEARS
OF NOT LOVING MYSELF.
- HMM.
- AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT,
"WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF,
FEEL FREE TO HATE
AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT TO."
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU KNOW?
[CHUCKLES]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME, DELA.
NOW, DELA,
WHEN YOU SASHAYED AWAY,
PEOPLE FREAKED THE FUCK OUT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF
WEIRD, TOO, NO OFFENSE, AND...
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, HOW HAVE FANS REACTED
TO DELA'S PERPETUALLY
PERKY ATTITUDE?
- IT'S BEEN AMAZING.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PUTTING
THIS KIND OF POSITIVITY
INTO THE WORLD,
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE A LITTLE
OVER-THE-TOP AT TIMES.
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED
IS THAT I'VE HAD
SO MANY AMAZING CONVERSATIONS
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE FED
THAT ENERGY BACK TO ME,
AND SAID THAT IT SOMEHOW
HELPS TO LIFT THEM UP,
AND IT'S MADE BEN
A HAPPIER PERSON AS WELL.
- OH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
SO, WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST
ABOUT DOING THE SHOW?
- IT IS AN ACTUAL RACE.
I DON'T THINK AT HOME
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW FAST WE'RE ACTUALLY
DOING THINGS,
BUT YOU'RE, LIKE,
STUMBLING OUT TO THE RUNWAY
AND STRAPPING YOUR SHOE
AND GLUING ON YOUR EYELASH,
AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE, "TELL US
ABOUT WHEN YOUR MOM DIED,"
AND IT'S ROUGH.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.
YEAH.
SO, DARIENNE,
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT.
WHAT WERE
YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH DELA?
- YOU KNOW,
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SHE SNAPPED, I SNAPPED.
WE KIND OF HAD A MOMENT,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW...
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT
ALWAYS HAVING GREAT TIMES,
IT'S ABOUT HAVING THOSE TIMES
THAT YOU NEED
TO STRUGGLE THROUGH,
SO I FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO HER.
- YEAH.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL WATER
UNDER A DUCK'S BACK,
OR WHATEVER THE PHRASE IS.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
DARIENNE, I DID
ACTUALLY WANT TO BRING
A LITTLE PEACE OFFERING.
YOU ONCE SAID THAT I WAS
LIKE A RUSSIAN DOLL,
AND SO HERE'S YOUR VERY OWN
DELA RUSSIAN DOLL.
- OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S MORE GOODNESS INSIDE!
- YES.
- IS THERE CANDY IN THERE?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO.
AN APOLOGY,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND, YOU KNOW?
AND GIVING ME MY REALITY CHECK.
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY STRESS I CAUSED YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- AW.
I LOVE THAT, I LOVE THAT.
NOW, DARIENNE,
YOU CONFIDED IN ME
THAT YOU'D HAD A BAD
FALLING-OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS,
AND, AS I'VE SAID,
WE GET TO CHOOSE OUR FAMILIES,
BUT SOMETIMES,
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY,
"DRAG RACE" CAN BRING
FAMILIES TOGETHER.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- HI, DARIENNE, IT'S MOM.
WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
WITH YOU TODAY,
BUT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW WE DID
WATCH A FEW OF THE EPISODES,
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU.
WE KNOW HOW TOUGH
IT WAS FOR YOU TO COME OUT,
AND TELL US WHO YOU ARE,
AND HOW YOU FEEL,
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU,
AND THAT WE SUPPORT YOU,
AND WE NOW ARE COMING OUT
AS DARIENNE'S PARENTS.
I'M HOPING THAT
WE CAN MAKE THIS MAYBE BE
THE FIRST DAY
OF THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
- HEY, DARIENNE, YOUR MOM
REALLY LIKED THE EARRINGS
YOU HAD ON THE OTHER NIGHT,
SO, GUESS WHAT?
I WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT HER A PAIR.
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, SON.
- WE LOVE YOU, DARIENNE.
- AW!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, DARIENNE, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- I NEVER,
IN A MILLION YEARS,
THOUGHT THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN,
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
AND I LOVE YOU, GUYS, YOU KNOW?
SO...BRAVO.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- IN THE OVERSTOCK.COM RED ROOM,

WHAT'S THE STATUS OF LAGANJA
AND ADORE'S RELATIONSHIP?
- OOH.
- YOU TWO ARRIVED AS FRIENDS,
BUT YOU HAD THIS HUGE BLOW-UP,
SO WE BROUGHT YOU BACK TOGETHER
TO WATCH THAT MOMENT
BEFORE IT AIRED.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- HI.
- AND THIS GIRL.
- [LAUGHS]
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, GOOD.
THIS IS GOING TO BE
REALLY INTERESTING.
- A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
- I'M SCARED.
- LET'S DO IT,
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.
- THIS RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S THE BITCH THAT I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW "YES, MAMA."
- WHEN I'M WITH MY BEST FRIENDS
I SAY, "YES, MAMA."
- THAT AIN'T HOW YOU TALK
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH YOU
WHEN THE CAMERAS AREN'T HERE.
- NOW I AM ANNOYING, I AM FAKE,
I'M NOT WHO I'M BEING...
- HOLD UP. HOLD UP, BITCH.
- I'M PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY I'M NOT...
- NO, THAT'S WHAT I DID NOT
WANT TO MAKE IT, GANJA.
- WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL IN THIS MOMENT?
- GANJA, I DIDN'T
WANT TO MAKE IT
THAT EVERYBODY
WAS ATTACKING YOU.
- YEAH, I FEEL VERY ATTACKED!
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO COME OFF
LIKE HOW IT CAME OFF,
BUT I WAS JUST, LIKE,
REALLY FRUSTRATED.
LIKE, YOU PUT THAT ON
TO DO SOMETHING
FOR, LIKE, A CHARACTER
OR SOMETHING.
I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
HEARD YOU TALK LIKE THAT,
IN MY LIFE.
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY.
- BUT THEN YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THAT'S YOU.
- YOU CAN SAY
THAT ALL THIS IS FAKE,
BUT THIS IS REAL, BITCH.
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M STILL
STICKING BY TO WHAT I'M SAYING.
I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THAT WAS GENUINE.
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO TURN
INTO A BULLYING LAGANJA THING,
BECAUSE I FUCKING
FELT BAD FOR YOU,
AND I STILL HAVE YOUR BACK,
EVEN THOUGH I HEAR THINGS.
- I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S THINGS THAT...
AHH, YOU'VE HEARD
BECAUSE I'M FUCKING JEALOUS.
- LIKE...
- I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY FRIEND.
- I FEEL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE
A CONVERSATION, LIKE,
IN PRIVATE.
- SO, ADORE, DID YOU TWO END UP
HAVING A PRIVATE CONVERSATION?
- THERE IS A CUTE, LITTLE BAR
ACROSS THE STREET,
SO WE GOT A COUPLE
OF DRINKS, AND...
[LAUGHS]
WE ACTUALLY TALKED IT OUT,
AND I DID REALLY HAVE
A STRONG CONNECTION WITH LAGANJA
BEFORE COMING
INTO THIS COMPETITION,
SO WE'RE AT A GOOD PLACE
RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY ARE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, LAGANJA, DO YOU THINK
THE FRIENDSHIP IS MENDED?
- ABSOLUTELY.
RELATIONSHIPS GO THROUGH
TOUGH TIMES, AND WE'VE MOVED ON,
AND, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE ADORE WITH ALL MY HEART.
THAT'S MY SISTER,
AND I LOVE HER.
- RIGHT ON. RIGHT ON.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
THANK YOU, LADIES.
LET'S TAKE SOME FAN QUESTIONS
FROM THE AUDIENCE.
OH, OH, OKAY. HEY.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
I LOVE IT.
OKAY, THIS IS A FAN OF FACEBOOK
QUESTION FOR ADORE
FROM MIGUEL TORRES.
"I KIND OF GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU HAVE A CRUSH
"ON BIANCA DEL RIO
WHEN SHE'S NOT IN DRAG.
DO YOU?"
- UM...
[LAUGHTER]
IF I HAD A CRUSH ON BIANCA,
I WOULD HAVE TRIED
TO COP A FEEL, BUT I DIDN'T.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- I WOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH HER,
BECAUSE I ONLY GIVE TO CHARITY
ONCE A YEAR, ALL RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- ALL RIGHT,
WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION
FROM A YOUNG LADY IN YELLOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- HIEEEE.
- HIEEEE.
- I HAVE A FACEBOOK QUESTION...
[LAUGHTER]
FROM TEAL FLEMMING,
FOR GIA GUNN.
- [LAUGHS]
- "WHAT WAS WITH
THAT EYELASH, GIRL?"
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU KNOW,
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
I DO HAVE ONE EYE
THAT IS SMALLER
AND BIGGER THAN THE OTHER,
BECAUSE I DO HAVE
VERY ASIAN-ESQUE EYES,
AND HOPEFULLY
IT'S A LOT BETTER TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- HEY!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YES!
- [LAUGHS]
- OKAY.
HERE'S ONE FOR BIANCA
FROM NINA FORLINI,
AND SHE SAYS,
"HONESTLY, I JUST WANT
BIANCA TO READ ME,
AND SINCE SHE'S NOT HERE,
WHY DON'T..."
OH, "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST READ ME?"
OH, SHIT.
[LAUGHTER]
- WAIT, NOW, YOU KNOW
GOOD AND WELL, JIGGLY,
THAT WE ARE VERY,
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO IT,
BUT I'M GOING TO TRY, BITCH.
- [GROANS]
- YOU ARE FROM SEASON 4,
THE SEASON OF TEETH.
THAT WAS YOU, IT WAS
THAT LITTLE SNAGGLETOOTH
THAT CAME OUT AND SAID,
"HEY, I WANT TO BE
PART OF THE SHOW!"
[LAUGHTER]
OH, BITCHES, FUCK YOU,
IF WE WERE IN A BAR,
YOU WOULD BE LAUGHING
AT THIS BULLSHIT RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
DO WE HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
- HELLO, I'M ANDRE,
FROM WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS,
JOSLYN'S FIANCE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
JOSLYN, YOU KNOW,
I ASKED YOU 3 YEARS AGO
IF YOU WOULD MARRY ME, AND YOU
SAID THAT YOU WERE WAITING
TILL YOU GOT
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
UNTIL WE COULD GET MARRIED,
SO, YOU FINALLY MADE IT,
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF WE COULD GET MARRIED
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ALL SEASON LONG
YOU WERE FULL OF SELF-DOUBT.
THEN DURING THE GLITTER BALL
YOU HAD AN EPIPHANY.
- YES.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT WAS DEFINITELY
THE TALK THAT YOU GAVE ME.
IT CHANGED MY LIFE, REALLY,
AND I APPLIED THAT
TO MY DAILY LIFE
AS WELL AS MY DRAG CAREER.
IT WAS REALLY AN EYE-OPENER.
NO ONE HAS, LIKE,
EVER, LIKE, SAT ME DOWN
AND ACTUALLY PUT IT INTO WORDS
AND HAD IT MAKE SENSE,
AND I JUST, LIKE,
AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE A WINNER.
WELL, I STILL WANT TO WIN
REALLY BAD...
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, LIKE, REALLY BAD.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
A FULLY DEVELOPED CHARACTER
BECAUSE OF YOU
AND BECAUSE OF THE SHOW.
I FEEL MORE LOVE FOR MYSELF
THAN I'VE EVER FELT,
AND I NEVER THOUGHT THAT
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.
YOU GAVE ME THAT,
AND YOU MADE ME REALIZE THAT
WITH JUST PUTTING IT
REALLY SIMPLE.
- YEAH, YEAH, WELL,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY
HAVING SEEN THE SHOW?
- IN THE BEGINNING,
I THINK I REMEMBER EVEN TELLING
YOU THIS IN THE WORKROOM,
I WENT IN AND I WAS LIKE,
"HMM, I'LL PROBABLY MAKE IT
THIRD EPISODE," AND THEN...
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, BECAUSE I STARTED SEEING
ALL THE GIRLS' SHIT,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, FUCK," AND THEN...
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH.
YEAH, MAN, AND THEN I'VE SEEN
GIA'S STUFF, AND SHE'S LIKE,
"HOW ABOUT HER, THOUGH?
WELL, HOW IS SHE?"
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH."
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE, I STARTED APPLYING MYSELF
TO THE CHALLENGES MORE.
I REALLY FELT CRAZY, I WAS
LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YOU GOT THIS."
LIKE, "YOU ARE GOING TO SLAY
THIS SHIT, NO MATTER WHAT."
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SINCE WE STOPPED FILMING.
- I JUST FINISHED MY ALBUM.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THAT, YEAH.
- GREAT.
SO, ADORE, IF YOU WON
THE CROWN AND THE $100,000,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
- I WOULD TRY MY HARDEST
TO BREAK THROUGH MAINSTREAM
AND CARRY ON YOUR LEGACY,
I THINK IT'S TIME.
I MEAN, LADY GAGA IS DOING IT.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HER AND I IS I HAVE A PENIS,
AND THAT'S QUESTIONABLE,
AND I JUST...
[LAUGHTER]
MY THING IS, LIKE,
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME
THAT CRAZY DRAG SUPERSTAR,
POP STAR, TOUR THE WORLD,
INSPIRE KIDS AROUND THE WORLD,
AND I THINK WINNING
THE CROWN WOULD HELP ME
REALLY PUT MY STAMP ON THAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, I KNOW YOUR MOM, BONNIE,
IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.
- YES, SHE IS.
- LET'S SAY HELLO.
- HI, MOM!
- OH, HEY, BONNIE!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WHO IS SHE HERE WITH?
- SHE'S HERE WITH JERRY,
HER BOYFRIEND,
WHO'S ALSO A FAN OF THE SHOW,
AND HE LIKES BIANCA.
HE'S PROBABLY
JUST HERE TO WATCH HER.
[LAUGHTER]
HE THINKS SHE'S SO FUCKING COOL.
LIKE, I THINK IT'S, LIKE,
THE HUMOR THAT IS LIKE...
IT'S ODD, THEY HAVE THE KIND
OF THE SAME HUMOR.
I THINK THAT'S WHY
I LOOK AT HER AS A DAD.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU GOT ME, BITCH!
YOU GOT ME, BITCH.
- SO, BONNIE, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ADORE?
- JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
AND I MISS YOU.
- I MISS YOU, TOO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN, LIKE,
IN 2 1/2 WEEKS.
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.
- OH, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD.
- HMM, MAKING THAT MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.
- HEY!
WELL, THANK YOU, MISS DELANO,

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED."
"B" CAN STAND FOR MANY THINGS.
BEAUTIFUL, BALLSY, BOSSY,
OR JUST BIANCA DEL RIO.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- MY NAME IS BIANCA DEL RIO.
I AM AN INSULT COMIC,
JUST LIKE DON RICKLES,
BUT IN A DRESS.
YOU LOOK LIKE A DAMN ROLL
OF SCOTCH TAPE.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO LAND A JOKE.
- MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT WE STAY TRUE
TO OUR SPANISH HERITAGE,
SO MY FIRST WORDS WERE...
[KNOCKS]
"HOUSEKEEPING."
[LAUGHTER]
- I THINK THE DEL RIOS
NAILED IT.
- BALONEY!
- BIANCA IS SECRETLY ADORABLE.
- DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND.
- SHE'S THE TYPE OF PERSON WHERE
YOU, LIKE, WANT TO HUG HER,
AND SHE'S JUST LIKE,
"UGH, GET AWAY."
LIKE, IT'S VERY THAT.
- I HAD A GUARD.
I HAVE BUILT UP THIS WALL,
AND THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS CHANGED ME.
I WENT THROUGH A SELF-DISCOVERY,
ACCEPTING THAT I'M NOT
SUCH A BAD BITCH.
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANKS, RU,
YOU SHADY BITCH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, BIANCA,
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A NICE PERSON?
- [CHUCKLES]
NO, IT'S ALL IN THE EDITING.
IT'S ALL EDITING.
- [LAUGHS]
- WHAT I DO ON STAGE,
AND WHAT I'VE DONE
FOR A LONG TIME HAS BEEN
A BITCH OR AN INSULT COMIC
OR SOMEONE TO BE AFRAID OF,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IN MY EVERYDAY LIFE, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T GO TO RITE AID AND SAY,
"FUCK YOU, BITCH,
GIVE ME MY SHIT."
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, AND YOU'RE
A SEASONED QUEEN.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO AUDITION FOR THE SHOW?
- WELL, I REALLY DIDN'T,
YOU KNOW,
SEE ANYBODY THAT WAS LIKE ME.
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CERTAIN TYPE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS
FOR YOUNGER GIRLS
THAT KNEW BEYONCE MEDLEYS.
AND I WAS FRIENDS
WITH LADY BUNNY,
WHO GAVE ME SOME
GOOD ADVICE, AND SHE SAID,
"GIRL, TRY IT!
YOU NEVER KNOW!"
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHEN I TOLD HER
I WAS LEAVING TO DO THE SHOW,
SHE GOES, "THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO ELECTRIFY THE NATION.
SEE YOU IN A WEEK
WHEN YOU'RE ELIMINATED."
SO...
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, HOW HAS "DRAG RACE"
CHANGED YOUR LIFE?
- FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
WHO HAS WORKED IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR 18 YEARS,
IS GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY,
THIS PLATFORM,
HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL.
TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY AND GET
TO MEET ALL THESE PEOPLE,
AND THE FACT THAT I'M NOW A PART
OF IT IS PRETTY FUCKING CRAZY.
- IT IS, IT IS.
- IT'S INSANE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YOU ARE A QUEEN
WHO SPEAKS HER MIND.
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU TO WATCH?
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.
I HAD THOSE MOMENTS
WHEN I WOULD CRINGE,
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"OH, SHIT."
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT,"
BUT I THINK THAT
IN THAT SITUATION, YOU KNOW,
IT BRINGS OUT THE GOOD
AND BAD IN EVERYBODY.
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- WELL, IT WOULD MEAN
THAT I BEAT THESE OTHER BITCHES.
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK IT'D BE AMAZING,
I MEAN, I'M IN GREAT COMPANY.
AND I'VE REALIZED THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO BE A LIP-SYNC ARTIST,
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A DANCER,
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A SINGER,
I CAN BE ME, WHICH IS A FOOL,
AND DO IT ON THAT LEVEL.
[APPLAUSE]
- SO, WHO'S HERE
SUPPORTING YOU TONIGHT?
- MY GOOD LITTLE FRIEND LOLA
IS HERE TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, LOLA, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ROY LADY?
- LASHES AND LIPSTICKS
AND HIPS THAT KILL,
RUPAUL, YOU SURE HAVE
SOME BIG HEELS TO FILL.
BUT I KNOW BIANCA,
I'M HER NUMBER ONE FAN.
IF YOU CROWN HER OUR QUEEN,
I WON'T TELL SHE'S A MAN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- BIANCA, WE KNEW YOU WERE
A HARD AND HILARIOUS BITCH,
BUT IT'S REWARDING TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE A NICE ONE, TOO.
I PROMISE I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
YES.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, IT'S TIME TO FINISH
OUR LESSON IN THE ABCs OF DRAG,
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THE C-WORD IS.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- COURTNEY ACT, A PROVEN STAR
ACCUSED OF RESTING ON PRETTY,
AS IN PRETTY FUCKING AMAZING.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- IS THIS AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL?
MY NAME IS COURTNEY ACT.
I GUESS MY REPUTATION COULD
INTIMIDATE THE OTHER QUEENS.
I'M A SINGER.
- OH.
- ♪ I'M GOING TO BE
THE GREATEST STAR ♪
- YOU ARE A STAR.
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.
- COURTNEY KNOWS HOW TO DO SEXY.
SHE'S A NATURAL.
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?
- [GRUNTS]
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.
- SHE DOES RELY ON THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHO SHE IS.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.
- COURTNEY ACT
IS AN IMMENSE TALENT
WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.
- I AM ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION
FROM CHER!
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH
IN MY HETEROSEXUALITY
TO SAY "WOW."
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE]
- HAS BEING IN THIS COMPETITION
ADDED PRESSURE?
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY
A STAR DOWN UNDER.
- COMING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
THERE WAS SUCH HIGH EXPECTATION,
AND IT DID ADD
A LOT OF PRESSURE.
I LEARNT SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF
GOING THROUGH THIS COMPETITION.
- LIKE WHAT?
- AUSTRALIANS DO HAVE
A VERY BLUNT,
KIND OF HONEST SENSE OF HUMOR,
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES
WHERE I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS BEING HELPFUL,
AND I WATCH IT BACK,
AND I'M LIKE,
"OOH, DID SHE JUST SAY THAT?"
- [LAUGHS]
- SO I'M DEFINITELY
LEARNING TO CHIP AWAY
THAT SORT OF COLD
AUSTRALIAN EXTERIOR.
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- I MOVED FROM AUSTRALIA
3 YEARS AGO.
I MOVED FROM A FANTASTIC LIFE
INTO, LIKE,
A SHOEBOX APARTMENT
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD,
EARNING LESS MONEY
I DID WHEN I WAS 18,
AND IT WAS A STRUGGLE, BUT EVERY
MOMENT OF IT I WAS SO EXCITED,
BECAUSE I GOT TO BE HERE
LIVING MY DREAM.
AND IN JUST 3 YEARS
I'M SITTING ON THIS STAGE
AS ONE OF THE TOP 3
IN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
JUST HAVING THAT DREAM
VALIDATED, IT IS OTHERWORLDLY.
SO I THANK YOU,
AND I THANK YOU,
AND I THANK YOU ALL
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
- YES. YES.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELL, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
A LONG WAY FROM AUSTRALIA,
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HERE
TO SUPPORT YOU TONIGHT?
- I HAVE GOT A FRIEND HERE
WHO I ACTUALLY MET ON THE SHOW.
MR. CHAZ BONO.
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH!
- OH, MY GOODNESS!
[LAUGHS]
- HE WAS DOING
A MUSICAL PRODUCTION,
AND HE ASKED
IF I WOULD BE IN IT.
WE GOT TO BECOME FRIENDS.
IT'S JUST KIND OF,
LIKE, BLOSSOMED.
CHAZ CAME TO AUSTRALIA
WITH ME TO--
- REALLY?
- YEAH, TO DO MY SHOW
AT THE SYDNEY
GAY AND LESBIAN MARDI GRAS.
I GOT TO SING "I GOT YOU, BABE"
WITH CHAZ BONO.
- WOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
AMAZING, AND...
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE JUST FRIENDS?
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I AM
AN ORDAINED MINISTER.
[LAUGHTER]
- AND I'VE STILL GOT TIME,
I COULD MARRY YOU, GUYS.
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.
- OKAY.
- WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE OKAY.
I MEAN, SHE IS LOOKING
PARTICULARLY LOVELY TONIGHT.
- [LAUGHS]
- BUT WE'RE GOOD, I THINK.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF SHE WINS...
I MEAN, I COULD USE
HALF OF $100,000, BUT...
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M GETTING A PRENUP.
- I LOVE IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, LET'S GIVE A BIG ROUND
OF APPLAUSE TO OUR FINAL 3,
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN,
THEY DO LIVE FOR THE APPLAUSE,
OKAY?
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
[LAUGHS]
WHEN WE COME BACK,
I'M GOING TO CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
OR AM I? HMM...

OH, WHO ARE YOU POINTING AT?
- NICE TO MEET YOU, BIANCA.

I WAS STARSTRUCK.
NICE TO MEET YOU, COURTNEY,
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
MY NAME'S JOSLYN FOX.
THIS IS LIKE MEETING
A CELEBRITY.
I LOVE COURTNEY.
- I GUESS MY REPUTATION COULD
INTIMIDATE THE OTHER QUEENS.
I'M MOST FAMOUS
FOR BEING A FINALIST
ON THE FIRST SEASON
OF "AUSTRALIAN IDOL."
- SO, WHAT TYPE
OF ENTERTAINER ARE YOU?
- I'M A SINGER.
- OH.
- YEAH.
- LIVE?
- YEAH.
- OH, FUCK YOU.
COURTNEY LOOKS LIKE A GIRL,
VERY PRETTY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ME.
IT'S NOT DRAG.
[HEELS CLICKING]
- I HEAR A CLYDESDALE.
- THEY BETTER WIDEN
THE DOORWAYS
AND REINFORCE
THE RUNWAY, HONEY,
BECAUSE A BIG GIRL'S
IN THE HOUSE.
I'M DARIENNE LAKE,
I'M 24 YEARS OLD,
AND I'M A COMPULSIVE LIAR.
I WAS PICKED FAN FAVORITE
ON THE ONLINE FACEBOOK CONTEST.
HI, I'M DARIENNE.

[LAUGHTER]

I'M PRETTIER.
SOME OF THEM ARE FUNNY,
I'M FUNNIER.

- MAGNOLIA,
JUST A SPRINGTIME FLOWER.
I'M JUST BEGGING
TO BE POLLINATED, MYSELF.

[SIREN WAILS]

YOU'VE GOT SHE-MAIL.
- WHAT?
SHOULDN'T THERE BE MORE CHICKS?
- WELCOME, MY QUEENS.
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU WERE TARDY FOR THE PARTY,
BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHO COMES FIRST,
IT'S ABOUT
WHO CAN LAST THE LONGEST.
- OH.
- [SQUEAKY VOICE]
NOW, YOU GOT TO FIGHT
FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PARTY!
- [LAUGHTER]
- MY VOICE
IS SO FISHY, RIGHT NOW.
- [LAUGHTER]

[APPLAUSE]
- WELCOME
TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
NOW, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
IN FACT, LAST WEEK,
7 QUEENS CAME, COMPETED,
AND ONE HAS ALREADY
SASHAYED AWAY.
- OH.
- NOW, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
BY SPLITTING YOU
INTO TWO GROUPS,
YOUR CHANCE TO SNATCH
MY ATTENTION
IS BETTER THAN EVER.
BUT ON THE SHADY SIDE,
THERE'S A ONE IN 7 CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL BE ELIMINATED
BEFORE YOU EVEN MEET
THE OTHER QUEENS.
THE PRESSURE IS ON, LADIES.
ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR BIG CLOSE-UP?

BECAUSE YOU SHOW
A LOT OF BODY, DON'T YOU?

I MAY BE UNDERESTIMATED
BY THE OTHER QUEENS,
BUT I PLAN ON BEING

I'VE ALWAYS SAID "BLACK HORSE."
[GIGGLES]

ARE YOU KIND OF, LIKE,
NATALIE IMBRUGLIA FAMOUS?

I GOT SIGNED TO SONY BMG,
I TOURED AROUND THE COUNTRY,

A REALLY GREAT AND WONDERFUL
CAREER IN AUSTRALIA.

I'M NOT NERVOUS AT ALL
ABOUT GOING UP

LIKE, DRAG THERE.
I WAS ON A STEREO SHOP
COMMERCIAL,
BUT IT WAS ONLY LOCAL.
- TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
- WE WERE IN DRAG.
THEY WANTED SOME LOCAL,
LIKE, CELEBRITY-TYPE PEOPLE.

WERE AVAILABLE,
WHICH IS WHY YOU TOOK THE JOB.
- OOH!

- OH, HONEY,
IT'S STOLEN, IT'S GONE.
I DO THINK THAT YOUR EYE MAKEUP
IS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY,
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I COULD SEE YOUR EYES
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO.
- IT'S JUST A SOFTENING
OF THE EDGES,
BUT THOSE DIMPLES
ARE EVERYTHING.
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD SEE MY ASS.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.
- NEXT UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, HELLO, DEAR.
- YOUR FACE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
THAT'S HOW YOU SOFTEN
THE EDGES, RIGHT THERE.
- IT LOOKS GORGEOUS.
- BUT THAT SAID,
A LITTLE BORING HERE.
- I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE--
I'M A BIG GIRL.
I EMBRACE IT, THOUGH,
BUT I CANNOT HAVE RUCHING
IN FRONT OF MY BODY,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING
TO ACCENTUATE MY PUSS.
I WISH YOUR OUTFIT WAS STRONGER.
- NEXT UP, MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- MY EYES HONED RIGHT IN
ON THAT NOSE CONTOUR,
IT IS SO DARK, GIRL.
- AND THAT DRESS,
IT'S VERY BASIC.
IT'S, LIKE, SO--
- I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS PRINT IS BASIC.
- BUT YOU THINK
THIS REPRESENTS YOU?
- YES, BECAUSE I AM ATTRACTED
TO THINGS THAT ARE SO UGLY
THEY'RE FABULOUS.
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THAT.
- I--
- THAT'S NOT UGLY.
- BUT I DIDN'T LIKE MY BOX.
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
WITH RED AND WHITE CHECK.
- THE THING IS,
YOU COULD'VE DONE MORE.
- I'VE GOT A GODDAMN BOW
ON MY ASS.
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.
- I--OKAY.
- THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING
OLYMPICS, GIRL.
YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT
EVERY TIME.
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE
IN THIS BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE
TO LIKE YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON.
NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.
- HEY, JOSLYN.
- HELLO, YOU SEXY,
SEXY, BALD MAN.
- [LAUGHS]
THE WHOLE OUTFIT
IS JUST OVER THE TOP.
IT WAS LIKE A PARADE FLOAT.
- SHE DIDN'T WEAR ANYTHING
FROM HER BOX,
AND YOU WORE EVERY FRIGGIN'
THING IN YOUR BOX.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT.
CUT IT IN HALF.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- G'DAY.
- YOU'RE GIVING ME
CHERYL TIEGS' "COSMO" COVER,
1976.
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.
- I DID NOTICE
THAT YOU WERE TRIPPING UP
A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR SKIRT.
- IT'S JUST TOO LONG, I THINK.
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.
- SO, MILK,
DO YOU THINK THIS IS
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO YOU ARE?
- YEAH. I HAVE A VERY QUIRKY
PERSONA AND STYLE.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING
TO EVER FIT IN
WITH THOSE GLAMOROUS QUEENS,
AND SO, WHY NOT STAND OUT?
- YOU PROBABLY
COULD'VE LEFT OFF THE BEARD,
BECAUSE REALLY,
THE WHOLE ENSEMBLE
LOOKS LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS.
REALLY, IT'S LIKE
A FASHION ILLUSTRATION
JUST RIGHT OFF THE PAGE.
- YOU ARE OWNING EVERYTHING
OF WHO YOU ARE.
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
SQUIRREL FRIENDS,
LET'S START
WITH TRINITY KARDASHIAN BONET.
- I LOVE TRINITY'S CREATIVITY.
TRINITY BROUGHT
AN ENTIRE PERFORMANCE
TO THE RUNWAY.
- AFTER SHE TOOK THE PIZZA BOX
OFF FROM HER NECK,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS FIERCE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
I WOULD WEAR THAT DRESS.
- I LOVED HER SENSE OF HUMOR.
SHE'S A QUEEN I'LL BE WATCHING.
- THE ONLY CRITIQUE
IS THE MAKEUP.
- YOU GOT TO BLEND.
- SISSY THAT FACE.
- YOU BETTER
SISSY THAT FACE, GIRL.
DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE'S STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS.
- YEAH.
- BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WENT TO THE FANCY SECTION
AT DRESS BARN.
- UNFORGIVABLE IS THE RUCHING.
- THE COOCHIE RUCHING.
- OH, MY GOD.
THE PUFFY PUSS--
I CAN'T DEAL.
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- GIRL, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO WEAR COW PRINT,
YOU BETTER CAMP THE HELL
OUT OF THAT DRESS.
- SURE, WEAR A BELL
AROUND YOUR NECK.
IT'S INTERESTING
WATCHING MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD
GET SO DEFENSIVE.
I TOTALLY RELATE TO IT,
I'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF.
- I GET IRRITATED
WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE OR MY SISTERS.
- SURE.
- BUT I WANT TO BE
A BETTER VERSION OF ME.
THAT TAKES CONSTANT WORK.
- AND IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DEFENSIVE,
THEN IT DEFEATS THE POINT.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MOVE ON TO JOSLYN FOX.
- I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
FORGIVE THAT OUTFIT,
THE MIDSECTION HAD NO SHAPE.
- I DON'T MIND THAT OUTFIT.
IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S COMING OUT HERE
IN A CAREER WOMAN,
AND, YOU KNOW--
- NO, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION
WAS JUST A DISASTER.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON
TO THAT OUTFIT,
SO SHE DEFINITELY
WAS RELYING ON HER BODY,
WHICH, HEY,
IF YOU'VE GOT IT, RELY ON IT.
- YEAH.
- DO WHATEVER YOU CAN.
- BUT I JUST WOULD
EXPECT A LOT MORE FROM HER.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
WHO WANTS MILK?
- HOPEFULLY,
MILK WILL BE ABLE
TO MAKE THE LOOK
MORE FEMININE WHEN WE ASK HER.
- WITH THAT SAID,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BALLSY MOVE
TO COME OUT WITH A BEARD.
- I LIKE A BIG SET OF BALLS.
- YEAH, GIRL.
- YOU KNOW, HONEY, PLEASE.
- [LAUGHS]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU'RE SAFE.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOUR COUTURE
WAS A REAL MAUI WOWIE.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
YOU'VE WON A $2,500
SHOPPING SPREE
FROM FABRIC PLANET.
MILK, FOR NOT PLAYING IT SAFE,
YOU'RE SAFE.
COURTNEY ACT.
BODY, 10,
COUTURE, 6.
YOU'RE SAFE.
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,
YOUR BOVINE DESIGN
WAS NOT DIVINE.
WHERE'S THE BEEF?
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR FACE IS PAINTED
FOR THE AGES,
BUT YOUR RUCHE LOOKED RUSHED.
JOSLYN FOX,
YOUR COUTURE REMINDS ME
OF A WEDDING--
SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING BORROWED,
SOMETHING BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW,
PINK, RED, CHARTREUSE.
- [LAUGHS]
- JOSLYN FOX, YOU'RE SAFE.
DARIENNE, MY DEAR,
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- IT'S JUST ME AND MAGNOLIA.
- GIVE ME THE FIRING SQUAD,
I'M READY.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

DON'T LIKE THEM.

- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
7 QUEENS CAME,
AND ONE HAS ALREADY
SASHAYED AWAY.
- SERVE THAT FACE, GIRL,
WE'RE LOSING IT!

WERE YOU ON SEASON ONE?"
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, WE'RE
PLAYING THAT THIS YEAR, BITCH?"
- WELL, YOU GIRLS...LOOK GOOD.

HOW TO THROW IT.
'KAY, 'KAY?

FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE SCREEN-TESTING
FOR A NEW HORROR FILM
FRANCHISE...
[DISTORTED VOICE]
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL."
[LAUGHTER]
- WORKING IN TEAMS OF 6,
YOU'LL SERVE
SCARY MOVIE REALNESS
IN TWO SICKENING SCENES,
ONE SET IN THE SIXTIES
AND ONE IN THE EIGHTIES.
HASHTAG "SCREAMQUEENS."
MILK AND ADORE,
YOU ARE TEAM CAPTAINS.
HERE ARE YOUR SCRIPTS.
PICK YOUR SPOOK SISTERS.
- MISS BIANCA.
- I'M SPOOKY.
- MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- COME ON, GIRL, LET'S SCREAM.
- [LAUGHS]
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, THIS IS NOT
LIKE GYM CLASS.
[GIGGLES]
- DELACREME.
- [LAUGHS]
- MISS COURTNEY ACT.
- GIA GUNN.
[LAUGHS]
- JOSLYN.
- WE'LL BE A SCREAM.
[LAUGHTER]
- APRIL.
- OH, YES.
- TRINITY KARDASHIAN.
- THAT, OF COURSE, MEANS
VIVACIOUS GOES TO TEAM ADORE.
- COME, DARLING, COME.
- OH, YEAH.
- VERY INTERESTING.
YOU CHOSE THE QUEENS
FROM YOUR ORIGINAL GROUPS.
- OF COURSE I CHOSE MY GROUP.
THEY'RE THE BEE'S KNEES.
THAT FIRST GROUP
HAS SOME PRETTY BITCHES,
BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN...
[SCREAMING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- BYE, RU.
- [SCREAMING]
[LAUGHTER]
- JUST DIE ALREADY.
[LAUGHTER]
- OKAY, EVERYONE...
OH, I LOVE THIS.
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF EIGHTIES HORROR MOVIES.
SO, AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT
THAT IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
VERSION, I WAS FREAKING OUT.
OKAY, I'M HEATHER,
YOU'RE BECKY.
- OKAY.
- YOU'RE THE CRAZY MOTHER.
- YES.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- YOU WANT TO BE
SCARY HEAD IN THE BOX?
AT THIS POINT,
WE HAVE LIMITED TIME.
I'VE JUST GOT TO HAND
THIS SHIT OUT
LIKE IT WAS CANDY
OUT OF A PINATA.
CATCH IT, BITCH,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE ROLE.
HOLD ON, WHERE AM I?
- PLEASE, DON'T LET ME BE BUTCH.
- AND THEN YOU'D BE
THE BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT.
- YOU COULD DO THAT, NO?
- YEAH.
"STOP! WHAT THE HELL?
I'M A WORKING LADY."
- THERE IS NOTHING MANLY
ON APRIL,
SO SHE'S GOT
SOME STRETCHING TO DO.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- EW, GAG ME WITH A...
"DALARIAN."
WHAT IS IT?
- A DELOREAN.
- DELOREAN. WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S, LIKE, AN EIGHTIES CAR.
- OH, OKAY.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DELOREAN.
FOR ALL I KNOW,
IT'S A FUCKING ANCIENT DILDO.
I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WELL, NOT MY FATHER...
BECAUSE...BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A FATHER.
- I'M A LITTLE WORRIED,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THAT SOME OF MY TEAMMATES
CAN DO THEIR ROLES.
ADORE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,
BUT, SINK OR SWIM,
SHE IS THE LEADER.
- COMING UP...
ACTION!
- [SCREAMING]
- OKAY.
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
- I THINK YOU WOULD BE
A GOOD MRS. BATES.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME,
I LIKE ALL OF THEM.
- OUR TEAM GETS
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL,"
THE ORIGINAL,
SET IN THE SIXTIES.
I'M EXCITED
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL
IS ALWAYS BETTER
THAN THE SEQUEL.
- I WAS THINKING MRS. HITCHCOCK
WITH A BRITISH ACCENT,
BECAUSE I'VE GOT AN ACCENT.
- OKAY, SO, SCARY HEAD IN A BOX.
DARIENNE, SCARY HEAD IN A BOX?
- SURE.
NOBODY WANTS THIS
"HEAD IN A BOX" ROLE.
IT'S A SMALLER ROLE,
AND IT'S JUST A HEAD IN A BOX,
BUT I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT.
- YOU COULD BE SLUTTY SALLY.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
STICK WITH THESE CHARACTERS.
- ALL RIGHT.
- I REALIZE MY CHARACTER
HAS THE MOST LINES,
AND NOW I'M PISSED,
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
TO LEARN A LOT OF SHIT,
AND I AM NOT AN ACTOR.
COME ON, SANDRA DEE...
OH. COME ON, SANDRA DEE,
IT'S TIME TO PUT...
POP YOUR CHERRY.
- WHAT IF YOU DID IT, LIKE,
"LET'S GET REAL, GIRL?"
LIKE, "SHUT UP, GIRL,
IT'S JUST ME."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- OH, YOU WANT ME TO BE BLACK?
- WELL, I THINK IT'D BE FUNNIER.
- THE BLACK GIRL IS PLAYING
GHETTO. HOW ORIGINAL.
- TRINITY SAID SHE WOULD LIKE
TO LEARN FROM EVERYONE,
AND SHE DOESN'T CONSIDER HERSELF
A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS.
BUT SHE'S LIKE
VERY, VERY DEFENSIVE.
SHE NEVER WANTS TO HEAR IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MEMORIZE
THESE LINES, BITCHES.
[THUNDER]
- WELCOME, TEAM MILK.
NOW, THIS IS YOUR SCREEN TEST.
ACT AS IF YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT,
BECAUSE, WELL...
IT DOES.
ALL RIGHT, PLACES, PEOPLE.
PEOPLE, PLACES!
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
WE'RE ROLLING, AND...
ACTION.
- OH, MRS. HITCHCOCK,
DID YOU SEE
THE FULL MOON TONIGHT?
PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID ONE DAY
HE'LL PUT A MAN UP THERE.
- WELL, I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN EXPLORING
YOUR FEMININE MYSTIQUE.
- [SNORTS]
- BIANCA AND COURTNEY
IS FLYING THROUGH THEIR LINES
LIKE THEY'VE BEEN DOING
MOVIES FOR YEARS.
BITCHES.
- "THERE WILL BE BLOOD."
- NO!
[SCREAMING]
- AND CUT.
VERY GOOD.
YOU BITCHES
HAVE BEEN SLAYED BEFORE.
[LAUGHTER]
- HELLO?
SALLY, ARE YOU HERE?
- RING, RING.
- GASP!
- [CHUCKLES]
- JOSLYN IS TOTALLY SELLING IT.
MUCH FUNNIER THAN I EXPECTED.
- GASP!
- GASP!
- JEEZ, BETTY, IT'S JUST ME.
DON'T FLIP YOUR WIG.
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
EVER SINCE THEY INVENTED
BIRTH CONTROL, YOU...
- CUT.
TRINITY, YOU HAVE
TO PLAY TO THE CAMERA,
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE YOU
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND.
- WE'RE GOING TO POP
YOUR CHERRY TONIGHT.
THE BOYS ARE COMING OVER.
- CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT.
TRINITY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOUR BACK IS TURNED.
- YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS MY CHARACTER,
KIND OF LIKE SASSY GHETTO.
- WELL, JUST BE SASSY GHETTO
FACING YOUR CAMERA.
SEE, OVER HERE, YOU KEEP DOING
THIS THING WHEN YOU'RE GOING,
"SO AND SO AND SO
AND SO AND SO."
AND THEN,
SO WE KEEP SEEING THIS.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN RUPAUL
LITERALLY GET OUT HIS SEAT
AND HAVE TO SHOW SOMEBODY
WHERE A CAMERA IS,
AND IT REALLY THREW ME OFF.
SORRY, GUYS.
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
- SASHAY AWAY,
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LOOK IN THE PINK BOX.
- YOUR MOTHER
DARNS SOCKS IN HELL!
- [LAUGHS]
- CUT.
- TRINITY,
WHEN YOU PICK THAT BOX UP,
THERE NEEDS TO BE A REACTION.
THERE'S A HEAD ON A TABLE
WITH A SATANIC STAR ON IT.
- GOT YOU.
- I MAY ACTUALLY
PASS OUT IN THIS BOX
IF TRINITY CONTINUES TO FUCK UP.
I MAY END UP
PUNCHING HER IN HER BOX
IF SHE DOESN'T STOP FUCKING UP.
- WELCOME, TEAM ADORE.
- I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE,
BECAUSE I GOT
THE SHIT STRATEG...
STRATEGICALLY, WHATEVER.
I HAVE IT STRATEGICALLY
STRATEGIZED.
THIS IS GOING TO GO GOOD.
I'M A GOOD LEADER,
I'M A LIBRA.
- APRIL AND LAGANJA,
YOU ALL READY?
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- ALL RIGHT, READY, SET, ACTION.
- YEAH.
- THIS PLACE IS GOING CONDO.
IF YOU DON'T BUY IT,
SOME YUPPIE WILL.
- YOU HAVE A HEAD
FOR BUSINESS.
LET'S GET PHYSICAL.
- STOP!
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
- OKAY.
LET'S CUT.
- AM I TOO BOYISH?
- IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
- OKAY, COOL.
PLAYING A BUTCH CHARACTER
FOR A DRAG QUEEN
IS A MINDFUCK, REALLY.
I'M A GAY BOY BEING A WOMAN,
BUT I NEED TO BE BOYISH AS WELL.
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE MOVING ON.
- AY, DIOS MIO.
- ACTION.
- HEATHER?
HELLO?
- RING, RING.
- WHAT IS THAT?
OH, MY NEW CELL PHONE.
- CUT.
- GIA, DON'T FORGET
THE GREAT LINES,
LIKE, "OH, DUH,
MY NEW CELL PHONE."
LIKE, THOSE "DUHS" REALLY
GIVE IT THE EIGHTIES FLAIR.
- OKAY.
- DUH.
ACTION.
- LIKE, HELLO?
WHO IS THIS?
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?
- ADORE, THAT'S YOUR CUE.
- OH, FUCK, YES.
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE!
- [SCREAMING]
- AND THEN YOU HAVE...
DIALOGUE AFTER THAT.
- DON'T HAVE A COW, HEATHER.
- HER NAME IS BECKY,
YOUR NAME IS HEATHER.
- SHIT.
- NO. DO YOU ALL HAVE
YOUR LINES MEMORIZED?
- YEAH.
- LIZA MINNELLI LIES.
- OKAY.
- I COULD NOT GO ON THE STAGE
WITHOUT KNOWING MY LINES.
THAT'S JUST UNCALLED FOR.
ADORE IS THE TEAM CAPTAIN,
AND I FEEL SO WORRIED
FOR OUR TEAM,
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT PROFESSIONAL.
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TOUCH THIS BIG,
PINK, FURRY BOX.
NO, DON'T TOUCH
MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER'S...
- YOUR MOTHER SCRUBS DOCKS IN...
- SORRY, I STEPPED ON YOUR LINE.
- CUT, CUT, CUT.
DID YOU GUYS REHEARSE AS A TEAM
BEFORE YOU CAME ON?
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A WHOPPING NO.
- SO BASICALLY I'M FUCKED,
BECAUSE I'M THE TEAM LEADER,
AND EVERYTHING COMES ON MY BACK.
- COMING UP...
- MY LIFELONG DREAM
IS TO BE BEYONCE IN VEGAS.
- AND YOU ARE BEYONCE.
- OH, I AM.
- [LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
- OH, GIRL,
SO GOOD TO BE HOME, EH?
TODAY'S RUNWAY IS OUR BEST DRAG.
MAMA IS LIVING, OKAY?
- SO WHAT TYPE OF DRAG
DO YOU DO IN NEW YORK?
- I DO, LIKE, THE REALLY OLD
TRADITIONAL CLUB'S KIDS
LEIGH BOWERY STYLE OF DRAG.
- OH.
- I GREW UP AROUND
THE REAL CLUB KIDS,
PEOPLE LIKE AMANDA LEPORE,
LADY BUNNY, AND LAVINIA,
WHO USED TO COME DRESSED
AS A FURNACE,
WITH FIRE COMING
OUT OF HER MIDSECTION.
THERE WERE NO BOUNDARIES,
WHEN YOU WERE GOING
TO WALK INTO A CLUB,
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE ON.
MY COSTUMES ARE VERY ABSTRACT,
AND A LOT OF GIRLS ARE LIKE,
"WELL, MISS THING,
THAT LOOK'S NOT GOING GET YOU
ANYWHERE WHATSOEVER."
- WELL, I WAS GOING
TO ASK YOU THAT.
YOU NEVER FELT THE NEED
TO WANT TO REVAMP YOURSELF?
- THE NEWER GENERATION
ONLY KNOW OFF THE FISHY LOOK,
BUT WHEN I WALK INTO A CLUB,
ALL EYES ARE ON ME.
YOU'RE STILL
THAT LITTLE GIRL IN THE CORNER
STILL TRYING
TO LOOK LIKE A LADY.
- MY LIFELONG DREAM IS TO BE
AN ILLUSIONIST IN VEGAS.
I WOULD LOVE TO BE
BEYONCE IN VEGAS.
- YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THOSE GIRLS ARE VERY SEASONED.
THEY'RE NOT TWO YEARS
INTO THE GAME.
THOSE GIRLS ARE,
LIKE, 15, 10 YEARS...
- BUT I MEAN,
THE BRITNEY SPEARS ILLUSIONIST,
SHE'S NOT 15 YEARS
INTO THE BUSINESS.
- YEAH, BUT SHE REALLY
LOOKS LIKE BRITNEY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY
THAT LOOKS LIKE BEYONCE.
YOU CAN PAINT
TO BE DIONNE WARWICK,
YOU CAN PAINT TO BE DIANA ROSS,
BUT BEYONCE IS JUST PRETTY.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- REALLY, BITCH?
BEYONCE IS A HARD ONE TO DO.
YOU CAN DANCE IT,
YOU CAN LIP-SYNC IT,
BUT IF YOU DON'T REALLY
LOOK LIKE HER, HMM.
AND LET'S FACE IT, TRINITY
LOOKS MORE LIKE SAMMY DAVIS JR.
IN A BEYONCE WIG.
- I COULD JUST
START MY OWN SHOW.
YOU KNOW, MY OWN ILLUSION SHOW,
AND TRY TO GET SOME
REALLY GOOD GIRLS THERE.
- THAT'S THE TICKET.
- SEE IF IT'LL BUILD UP.
- YEP, GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT WHEN...
OH, WHATEVER, GIRL.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THAT FUCKING SENSITIVE.
- I'M NOT SENSITIVE AT ALL!
- OH, I FORGOT,
YOU'RE NOT SENSITIVE.
YOU'RE BEYONCE.
- OH, I AM.

- THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE REST OF YOUR AFTERLIFE.
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
- WOW.
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT OUR TEAM
IS PROBABLY ON THE LOWER END
OF THE SCALE.
- THAT WAS ELECTRIFYING.
- I FOUND IT A LITTLE FUNNY THAT
THEIRS WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE
AND OURS WAS IN COLOR.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- NO.
- COMING UP...
- THE PERFORMANCE WAS FLAT.
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT.
- SILENCE!
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
YOU GIRLS WERE A REAL SCREAM,
BUT ONE GROUP
WAS BLOODY FABULOUS.
TEAM...
MILK, CONDRAGULATIONS.
YOU ARE ALL SAFE
FROM ELIMINATION THIS WEEK.
TRINITY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I JUST, FOR A MOMENT, I REALLY
THOUGHT I PUT YOU GUYS DOWN,
AND I'M A VIRGIN ACTOR,
BUT THANK YOU
FOR SEEING THAT I TRIED.
- YOU HAD US SCARED AT FIRST,
BUT YOU TOOK DIRECTION,
AND IT SHOWS.
- THANK YOU.
- DARIENNE LAKE...
NOW, FOR GIVING YOUR TALKING
HEAD, BODY, AND SOUL,
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
- WHAT?
[APPLAUSE]
- YOU'VE WON
A FIVE-NIGHT STAY FOR TWO
AT THE ISLAND HOUSE
KEY WEST FIVE-STAR RESORT.
TEAM MILK,
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.
TEAM ADORE, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
LET'S START WITH APRIL CARRION.
- HELLO!
- I LOVE THE UMBRELLA,
LOVE THE COLOR,
AND I FIND YOU
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
- BUT THE PERFORMANCE
AS A BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT
WAS FLAT.
I DIDN'T REALLY GET BUTCH,
I GOT BOY.
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HELLO, MAMA RU.
- I LOVE YOUR FASCINATOR,
THE BUTTERFLY HAT.
IT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU.
- IN THE MOVIE, YOU DID OKAY.
- BUT YOU WERE CARRYING
APRIL THROUGH IT.
WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION,
YOU CAN'T RELY
ON THE OTHER PERSON
TO GIVE YOU THE ENERGY
TO KEEP YOU GOING.
YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
WITHIN YOURSELF.
- NEXT UP, GIA GUNN.
- I LIKED YOUR PERFORMANCE,
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
I THOUGHT YOU TOTALLY
CHANNELED VALLEY VIRGIN.
- WELL, IT'S FUNNY, GIA,
BECAUSE ON THE SET
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER
A LOT OF THE DIALOGUE,
AND IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU HAD A TECHNIQUE,
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THERE WAS
NO TECHNIQUE, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- ARE YOU CINCHED?
- NO.
- YEAH.
- I HAVE A HOG BODY RIGHT NOW.
- SO, YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER.
- I WAS.
- AND HOW'D YOU ASSIGN
THE OTHER ROLES?
- LIKE THIS: YOU HAVE THAT,
YOU HAVE THAT,
AND YOU HAVE THAT.
- SO, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE
IS A GAME BEING PLAYED HERE.
- AND OF ALL THE GIRLS,
YOU WERE THE LEAST PREPARED.
MY GUESS IS THAT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE CHARISMATIC,
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAIL BY
WITHOUT HAVING
TO PUT THE WORK IN.
YOU OWE IT TO YOUR TALENT
TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
LIKE IF I, LIKE, LET YOU DOWN.
I'M CONSTANTLY PROVING MYSELF
WITHIN THE DRAG COMMUNITY,
AND I'M HERE TO PROVE TO YOU
AND TO EVERYBODY I'M A STAR.
- STARS PUT IN THE WORK.
ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME.
- YOU DELIVERED A VERY GOOD
PERFORMANCE IN THE MOVIE.
YOU HAD JUST
ONE OF THE BEST SCREAMS.
- THANK YOU, BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU SITTING
SO CLOSE TO MICHELLE'S EARRING.
[LAUGHTER]
- [BUZZES]
- NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- SEE, THIS TYPE OF LOOK
I DON'T HATE,
BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH IT,
AND SO DID RU.
- SURE.
- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DOING.
- RIGHT.
- WITH THAT SAID, THE ACTING,
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNSURE
OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO KIND
OF GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT.
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT
REALLY EMBRACING FULLY.
- IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAVE NO THEATRICAL
BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER.
- LOOK AT YOURSELF.
WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING
IS THEATER!
- ARE YOU HOLDING YOUR HEADPIECE
BACK SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR?
- YES.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING THAT
MARIAH CAREY THING, YOU KNOW,
WHERE SHE HOLDS
HER EAR LIKE THAT.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
JUST BETWEEN US SHE-DEVILS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
STARTING WITH APRIL CARRION.
- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN
A LITTLE BETTER WORK
IN THE FILM.
- YEAH, I THINK THAT APRIL
WAS MISCAST IN THIS ROLE.
- ADORE WAS THE TEAM LEADER,
AND SO, THEREFORE,
SHOULD SHE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HANDING OUT THE JOBS?
- THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON
TO LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER I LOVE.
I THINK SHE'S
INCREDIBLY CHARMING.
THE ACTING WAS...
- SHE DIDN'T SUCK.
- I'M SAYING SHE DIDN'T SUCK.
- I THINK IT WAS PARTLY
BECAUSE HER SCREEN PARTNER
WAS APRIL CARRION
EVEN TONGUE KISSING
COULDN'T SAVE IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
GIA GUNN.
- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE IT WAS HER BEST DRAG.
AS FAR AS HER PERFORMANCE,
IT WAS FLAT.
- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW FAMILIAR
SOME OF THEM ARE WITH ACTING.
AGE DOES HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BIT WITH IT.
- BUT YOU WERE NOMINATED
FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD
WHEN YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD.
- YES, BUT I'D BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 6.
[LAUGHTER]
- LET'S GO TO ADORE DELANO.
- WELL, I ADORE ADORE.
SHE'S KIND OF LIKE
A DAUGHTER I WANT TO SLAP.
- [LAUGHS]
- SHE WAS KIND OF ILL-PREPARED,
BUT SHE WAS GOOD.
- RIGHT.
- THE "BITCHING," SHE GETS IT.
AND I THINK WHEN SHE DOES
NURTURE HER INNER TALENT,
SHE'S GOING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE.
- YEAH, BUT THAT
MIGHT BE TOO LATE.
NEXT, BENDELACREME.
- THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
WHO'S A STAR.
- SHE WAS INCREDIBLE.
IF DELA HAD BEEN
ON THE WINNING TEAM,
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
VIVACIOUS.
- THAT LOOK WAS DATED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT EVEN
READS LIKE BEING FEMININE.
- UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE DIDN'T BRING IT ON.
TO BE A TALKING HEAD,
YOU GOT TO LET IT OUT,
EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST...
GIVING HEAD.
- [LAUGHS]
- BUT I DO GIVE HER CREDIT
FOR STAYING TRUE TO WHO SHE IS.
- THAT CAN BE A HINDRANCE IF
YOU REFUSE TO MOVE BEYOND THAT.
- I BEG TO DIFFER.
SHE LOOKED SAD
BECAUSE SHE FELT INFERIOR.
- AND THEN WHEN SHE LAUGHED...
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK...
MY GIRLS.
AHH.
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BENDELACREME...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- VIVACIOUS,
CONCERNING YOUR HEAD,
I'M AFRAID THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME COMPLAINTS.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU'RE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU'RE SAFE.
GIA GUNN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO...
YOU'VE GOT REAL TALENT...
BUT DO YOU HAVE
THE DISCIPLINE IT TAKES
TO GO ALL THE WAY?
APRIL CARRION...
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR PARADE,
BUT YOUR SCREEN TEST
WAS A WASHOUT.
ADORE DELANO...
YOU'RE SAFE.
APRIL, MY DEAR, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC...
FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK...
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.

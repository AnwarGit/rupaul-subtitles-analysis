00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,567
Reading is fundamental.

3
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:09,166
- My new book is going
to hit stores soon.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,633
It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>

5
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,200
- Tatianna, thank you
for being here.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,433
- Thank you, and let me tell you
about this beverage.

7
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,433
- Uh, good luck.

8
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,667
- Fuck.

9
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,233
- I'm a little worried
about your confidence level.

10
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,633
- If you're gonna look
like a coke whore,

11
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,300
take the joke even further.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,667
- Raven, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

13
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,400
Two queens stand before me.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Tatianna, shantay you stay.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,333
- Are you playing with me?

16
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,633
- Jessica, sashay away.

17
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,934
- Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

18
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,100
-<i> And tonight...</i>

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,867
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"

20
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,433
<i>The dolls get a challenge</i>
<i>for the ages.</i>

21
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:46,600
- Whoa, Jesus.

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,233
- I've got a safety pin.

23
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,467
I thought, like, a low cut.

24
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,467
-<i> And a real life lesson...</i>

25
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,734
- Oh, I had dreams about this.

26
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:55,800
- I think that my drag mother
hit on me.

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,033

<i>Jessica was the last one to go.</i>

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
And it's kind of sad
because we all liked Jessica.

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
- Oh,<i> mira, mira!</i>

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,066
"I love you girls.

<i>Viva Puerto Rico!"</i>

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,700
I miss Jessica, but I still have
my girl Tatianna.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,100
You know, most people here
don't agree with that situation.

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,767
- Aw, Jessica.

53
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:21,767
- I honestly thought she was

54
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,100
gonna be, like,
in the top three.

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,700
<i>- Me too.</i>
<i>- I thought so too.</i>

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,066
- People are upset
that Tatianna's still here.

57
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,100
<i>And I was shocked too.</i>

58
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,200
<i>I was like, "Wow,</i>

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,066
Jessica's sending Tatianna
home tonight."

60
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,200
- But that's not the case.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,367
Raven loves to hear
her own voice.

62
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,066
- Why did you look at Ru
and go, "Really?"

63
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,166
- 'Cause I wasn't expecting
to be safe.

64
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,700
- So do you think
you shouldn't be here?

65
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
- No, I don't think
I shouldn't be here.

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,533
I just wasn't expecting
to be safe.

67
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,066
- But you questioned it.

68
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,967
- I was just pretty shocked.
[laughs]

69
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,934
- That lack of confidence,
that's not a superstar.

70
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:54,300
<i>Questioning yourself</i>
<i>is gonna make them go,</i>

71
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,867
"Okay, does she really not think

72
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,133
that she's that good
to be here?"

73
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,266
- Honestly,
I'm a little tired

74
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,367
of having to defend
my confidence

75
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,066
or my want to be here.

76
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:06,300
I could give two fucks less
what anyone has to say.

77
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,800
- How do you all feel
about the judges?

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,433
- Yeah, I love the judges too.

79
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:16,300
<i>I feel like I have gotten</i>
<i>some mixed messages.</i>

80
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,433
They want me funny,
but they want me glamorous,

81
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,467
but they don't,
and then they do.

82
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,433
He said to me, "I don't like
your style at all."

83
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,266
<i>Like, where do you go</i>
<i>from there?</i>

84
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,567
How am I ever gonna impress him
if he doesn't like my style?

85
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,100
[alarm sounds]

86
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,900
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got shemail.</i>

87
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,700
You know, a famous beauty
once said,

88
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,934
"After age 40,
a woman must choose

89
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:42,867
between her face and her ass."

90
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,200
Well, clearly this bitch
never met a drag queen.

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,467
Youth may be wasted
on the young,

92
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:53,400
but trust me, you want to be
the next drag superstar,

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,266
well, your future is staring
at you right in the face.

94
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,166
[engine roaring]

95
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,400
- Do we have to wear
a fat suit?

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,133
- Something about babies
and old people and...

97
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,700
- Maybe we're gonna go in
for surgery

98
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,834
to get our ovaries removed.

99
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,433
- Hello, hello, hello!

100
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,567
all: Hi!

101
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,767
- My babies,
look how far you've come.

<i>Today your mini challenge</i>

<i>is all about</i>
<i>your beautiful baby faces.</i>

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,700
In a moment, you'll have
to match this season's 12 queens

105
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,834
with their baby pictures.

106
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,100
The one who makes
the most matches

107
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,066
in the least amount of time
wins.

108
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,633
<i>Raven, are you ready?</i>

109
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,700
-<i> Yep.</i>

110
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,367
-<i> Ladyboy, baby boy, go!</i>

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,533
- All right. Yes.

112
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,667
Oh!

113
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,066
<i>I see a little tiny baby</i>

114
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,133
<i>and a big ol' Mystique face</i>
<i>on it just looking up like,</i>

00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,433
"How you doin'?"

116
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,633
Done.

117
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,233
-<i> There is definitely</i>
<i>an urgency</i>

118
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,333
<i>with me wanting to win</i>
<i>this mini challenge</i>

119
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,667
<i>just because I had</i>
<i>such a rough night</i>

120
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,300
having to lip-sync for my life.

121
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,200
-<i> Every second counts.</i>

122
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,100
<i>And where is the Puerto Rican?</i>

123
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,333
- [laughing]

124
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,467
What the fuck is that?

125
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,533
- Now, you all did a great job.

126

<i>Remember her?</i>

132
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,967
<i>- Shangela.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

133
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,066
Is that my little buddy
next to her right there?

134
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,834
- Oh, I thought that was Chucky.

- Doing nudes as a baby.

141

Oh, and look here.

<i>- The other Tyra.</i>
<i>- The other Tyra.</i>

144
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,467
And this, of course,
is baby Mystique.

145
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,100
Now, I have to explain this.

146
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,066
Mystique lost all of her
family photos in a fire.

147
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:12,233
Now, Tyra, you got 12 right
in 57 seconds.

148
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,900
Jujubee, you only got ten right,

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,633
and it took a minute
and 33 seconds.

150
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,700
Pandora, you got 12 right
in a minute and 24 seconds.

151
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,100
<i>So Tyra's still ahead.</i>

152
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,834
Raven, you also got 12 right
in one minute and six seconds.

153
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,400
- Oh, damn.

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,667
- And, Tatianna, you got
12 right in...

155
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,400
51 seconds.

156
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,900
Congratulations.

157
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,567
You won the baby face
mini challenge.

158
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:49,200

This week, you're gonna get
a chance to grow old gracefully.

- I was just like,
"Oh, what are we doing?"

172

-<i> Now, we are lucky</i>
<i>to live in a time</i>

173
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,533
where we can be more open
and honest than ever before.

174
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,834
And we have these men
and their generation to thank.

175
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:40,533
<i>Now it's your chance</i>
<i>to show your gratitude</i>

176
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,533
by making them fabulous.

177
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,066
-<i> Oh, no!</i>

178
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,433
We are going to have to put
old men in drag.

179
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:50,934
-<i> For your main challenge,</i>

180
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,433
<i>you'll transform</i>
<i>these silver daddies</i>

181
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>into your drag mamas.</i>

182
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,133
It's a NYX Cosmetics
golden girl makeover.

183
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:03,100
And, ladies, I expect to see
a definite family resemblance.

184
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,667
<i>In addition</i>
<i>to your NYX Cosmetics,</i>

185
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,633
<i>you can use your own drag</i>

186
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,500
plus shoes
from Le Dame Footwear

187
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,800
<i>and wigs courtesy</i>
<i>of Wig Pro Collection.</i>

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Don't hold back, because this
is your mama we talkin' about.

189
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,233
<i>Tatianna, as the baby face</i>
<i>mini challenge winner,</i>

190
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,400
<i>you get to pick first.</i>

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,333
Take a closer look.
You can look at the teeth.

192
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,266
- Smile.
[laughter]

193
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,667
-<i> Yeah, look at all of them.</i>

194
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:33,200
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
All right.

196
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,934
-<i> Of course, Tatianna goes up</i>

197
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,266
and picks the one
that I knew she'd pick:

198
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,900
the pretty one.

199
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,600
-<i> Tatianna, you're not done yet.</i>

200
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,834
Now you get to pair
the other queens

201
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:49,600
<i>with their drag mama.</i>

202
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
-<i> Oh, shit, I'm gonna get</i>

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,500
<i>one of these two bastards</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

204
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,100
<i>She's giving me</i>
<i>one of those two.</i>

205
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,133
<i>- Hi, Mama.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

206
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:57,800
- How are you?

207
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,066
-<i> So sweet.</i>

208
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,867
-<i> Juju did whisper to me</i>
<i>who she wanted,</i>

209
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,266
and that's my girl.

210
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,066
<i>Everyone else I just kind of</i>
<i>was like, "You here."</i>

211
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,166
- Mom!

212
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,667
-<i> The Boxxes.</i>

213
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,800
-<i> You here.</i>

214
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,433
-<i> Aw, isn't that sweet?</i>

215
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,734
<i>Dustin Sanchez.</i>

216
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:16,066
- I did consciously
leave Raven for last.

217
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:19,333
Steven, you're the mother
of Raven.

218
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,633
- Oh, how sweet!

219
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:22,767
- Hi, Mommy.

220
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,066
-<i> Aw, that's gorgeous!</i>

221
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,200
- Sure enough,
the last one I get,

222
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,066
the one with the full
fucking facial hair.

223
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,333
<i>I'm like, "Okay, bitch,</i>
<i>you watch.</i>

224
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,867
I'll turn
this motherfucker out."

225
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:36,333
- Now, I need you to show me
that charisma, uniqueness,

226
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,233
nerve, and talent
runs in the family.

227
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,633
Now, I'm gonna leave you
to have

228
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,066
a little mother-daughter
bonding time,

229
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,867
and I'll be back
a little bit later.

230
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:48,333
Gentlemen, start your engines.

231
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,600
And may the best "womens" win.

232
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
-<i> Do you got a walk?</i>

233
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,533
- I don't know how to do a walk.

234
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,900
- Come on, it's one, two--
- Oh, wait.

235
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,233
- In early gay liberation,
I did what we called skag drag.

236
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,667
Gender fuck.

237
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,433
You know, where we, like,
wear combat boots

238
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,000
and frilly dresses.

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,767
- I see a fierce diva
in my drag mother.

240
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,467
So I think that Tatianna
did a good job pairing me up.

241
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,333
Thank you, Tatianna.
Tss.

242
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,600
- This is, like,
3/4 of an inch taller,

243
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
and that's just enough to send
me into the orthopedic ward.

244
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,567
You know what I'm saying,
darling?

245
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,767
- Yes.

246
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,266
So Michael, um,
does have a limp.

247
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,333
- Whoa, Jesus.

248
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,700
-<i> I think</i>
<i>some of the other girls</i>

249
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,066
<i>might think I made</i>
<i>a bad decision choosing Michael</i>

250
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,300
because of his leg.

251
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,567
- But, um, who cares?

253
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,767
- Ouch! No way.

254
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,000
- Really?
- This is gonna take some work.

255
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,000
- Oh, man.

256
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,967
- I'm so excited!

257
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,266
The main challenge is gonna be

258
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:54,967
us turning these fabulous men
into our drag mother.

259
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:58,400
- I've got a safety pin
and I've got a spear.

260
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,066
I-I wear all kinds of junk
in here.

261
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,533
I-I put in all this stuff
for today.

262
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,500
- Wow.

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,667
- I thought maybe you'd do

264
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,967
something interesting with it,
like a low cut.

265
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,834
I wanted to give you
that option.

266
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,200
- Thank you for the option,
but we're gonna cover that up.

267
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,300
We're not--we're not gonna
show that off.

268
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,700
<i>My mother's gonna be</i>
<i>sexy conservative,</i>

269
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,467
fierce, confident,
and beautiful.

270
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,333
- I had a very interesting
experience

271
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,333
of being a part
of early gay liberation.

272
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,633
So I know what life is like

273
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,934
being in the closet
and out of the closet.

274
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,767
-<i> The point of this challenge,</i>
<i>I think,</i>

275
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,200
<i>is respecting your elders,</i>

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,066
respecting people
who have fought for you.

277
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,266
<i>At the same time, encouraging</i>
<i>and helping someone else</i>

278
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,600
to be as fierce as you are.

279
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,333
And my mother will not
be bearded.

280
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,200
- [laughs]

281
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,100
- Just don't think of, um,

282
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,433
the little Chihuahua
and the master.

283
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,066
That--no, no.

284
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,233
But if you want to do
master and slave,

285
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,967
that could work too.

286
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,333
If I want to be master...

287
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,834
- He's a little bit
of a dirty man.

288
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,600
- Oh, I had dreams about this.

289
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,533
- And I think that my
drag mother hit on me.

290
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,700
- It looks older
than I want to look.

291
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,967
No.

292
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,967
See, if we could get an
attractive-shaped one of these,

293
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,867
it would make my face
look a little thinner.

294
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,166
-<i> I think bigger hair</i>

295
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,834
<i>would make your face</i>
<i>a little thinner, though.</i>

296
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,200
- But didn't you see those,
though, on me?

297
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,633
It was just like...

298
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,934
- No, but you have--
just trust me.

299
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:19,333
I've been doing drag too long

300
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,100
to know that a flat wig
is gonna help out a big face.

301
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,433
- 'Cause what I was thinking--

302
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,900
- Were you not listening to me,
Mom?

303
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
- No!

304
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
- Just shh.

305
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,734
- I am a challenge.

306
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,266
- Michael is very theatrical.

307
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:35,867
- Because I've had a number of,
uh, injuries and health issues

308
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:39,500
that have caused my body
to look kind of beat up,

309
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,600
like I told you.

310
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,066
And that is your job,
to fix me up.

311
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,734
- Transforming someone older,

312
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,166
the face is a little bit harder
to transform.

313
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,066
The body may be a little bit
harder to transform.

314
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,633
Obviously, the skin
isn't as smooth and taut

315
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,400
as it is when you're younger.

316
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,567
- You're lucky 'cause I don't
have to shave here.

317
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,066
- You already take care of this?

318
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,100
- No, I don't have any.

319
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,200
- Oh, you just had it removed?

320
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
- No, it just fell out.

321
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,567
- Oh.

322
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,400
- Hello, hello, hello!

323
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,500
<i>Hi.</i>

324
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Ooh, these gorgeous wigs.

325
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,433
How's it going out
with your new mommy?

326
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,734
- It's Contessa Touché.

327
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,300
- Contessa Touché.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,834
- Wow, I love that.

329
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,400
<i>What do you have planned</i>
<i>for your drag mother's outfit?</i>

330
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,467
- She wants to just look
really elegant.

331
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,500
- Uh-huh.

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,800
- And she doesn't want to look
too old.

333
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,133
- Or too fat.

334
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,266
-<i> Really, the only</i>
<i>challenging thing with Contessa</i>

335
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,867
at the moment
is her confidence level.

336
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,300
- All right, carry on.

337
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,300
Hi, Raven.
- Hello.

338
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,133
- Hi, Steven. How are you?
- Hi, Ru.

339
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,967
- Does Steven
have a drag name yet?

340
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,200
- It's Golda Lamé.

341
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,433
- Golda Lamé.

342
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,066
Now, now, you know that this
is your challenge.

343
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,400
You will be judged
on this challenge.

344
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,433
- Yes.

345
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,500
Tatianna picked me last.

346
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,734
She thinks she's being cunty

347
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,500
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard

348
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,800
and is a little older-looking.

349
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,266
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,

350
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,400
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."

351
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
- All right, well, bring it.

352
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
- It's been broughten, honey T.

353
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,467
[laughter]

354
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:09,233
<i>My drag mother,</i>
<i>if she was a woman,</i>

355
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,333
would take her bra off, burn it,

356
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,900
never wear a high heel
in her life,

357
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
have a bush this big.

358
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,333
We're gonna dip her in Nair

359
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,066
and pull her out
and get her dressed.

360
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,133
- You got a lot of work to do,
so good luck.

361
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,967
- Thank you.

362
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,633
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.

363
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:23,700
- Well, well, well.

364
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,667
What's going on?

365
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,066
- I'm already nervous

366
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,767
<i>because I've never done</i>
<i>anyone else's makeup.</i>

367
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,834
So I'm kind of scared.

368
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,233
I don't know how to do it,

369
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,867
<i>'cause I hate</i>
<i>doing my own face.</i>

370
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:33,900
- You do?

371
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,200
- I don't like doing makeup.

372
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,066
Like, I would rather sit there
and have someone do it.

373
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,500
- You know, you got
a lot of work cut out for you

374
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,767
and not a lot of time.

375
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,333
- Okay.
- Thank you.

376
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,066
<i>All right, Tatianna.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.

377
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,600
- Why did you pick Michael
as your drag mama?

378
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,967
- Face and eyes.

379
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:53,567
- And you got to assign
all the other queens

380
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,066
to their drag mothers.

381
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,100
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,367
- What was your strategy?

383
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:58,367
- I really didn't have one.

384
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,367
-<i> You didn't have a strategy?</i>

385
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,800
- I really didn't have one.

386
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,367
- Well, Raven believes that, uh,
you chose her drag mother

387
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,400
because she had a beard.

388
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,433
- No, I mean,
you can shave a beard.

389
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,734
- Because, you know,
if you had,

390
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,100
that would've been
really fierce.

391
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,367
- There was a slight strategy,

392
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,200
but I'm not trying
to announce it to the room.

393
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,567
- All right, Tatianna, who uses
no strategy as her strategy,

394
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,967
<i>good luck.</i>

395
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:22,967
- Thank you.

396
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,166
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.

397
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,133
- And Mrs. Boxx.

398
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,166
- Just call me Litter.

00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,600
-<i> Oh, I love that.</i>

400
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,467
Pandora and Litter Boxx.
- Yes.

401
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,066
- The umbilical cord
is still attached.

402
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,200
- Oh, dear!

403
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>Yes, that's--that's, I think,</i>

405
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,734
- I think it is, yes.

406
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,667
- Would you like to demonstrate
your walk?

407
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,734
- Do I have to keep
my clothes on?

408
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,066
- You can keep your clothes on.

409
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,867
- I didn't want to.

410
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:51,300
- Do it as if you were
stark naked.

411
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes, show us
what you're working with.

412
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,667
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

413
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,700
Mama Litter.

Well, keep on keeping on.

415

See you, Miss Litter.
- See you.

-<i> All right, gather around,</i>

our special guest judges

<i>will include founder and CEO</i>

419
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,400
of NYX cosmetics, Toni Ko,

420
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,066
plus two legendary
Hollywood stars--

421
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:20,834
<i>the academy award-winning</i>
<i>actress Cloris Leachman...</i>

422
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,867
- Oh!

423
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,734
-<i> Cloris is also providing you</i>
<i>with clothes</i>

424
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,667
from her Clorisline collection.

425
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,934
<i>And last but certainly</i>
<i>not least,</i>

426
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,266
<i>the unsinkable</i>
<i>Miss Debbie Reynolds</i>

00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,300
<i>will be here.</i>

428
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,734
[laughter and applause]

429
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:37,934
-<i> My mother is so excited.</i>

430
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,867
She's like, "Oh, my God,
I love her, oh, my God!"

431
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,533
<i>I'm like, "Yes,</i>
<i>you see that excitement</i>

432
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,900
<i>"that you have for those girls?</i>

433
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,166
Now we need to put that
into our performance."

434
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,834
- Oh, and one more thing.

435
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:53,500
Tomorrow, in addition to your
fierce runway presentation,

436
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,800
you must perform a lip-sync duet
with your drag mother

437
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,066
to my song<i> Main Event.</i>

438
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,500
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>

439
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,600
How much more can we do
in this one challenge?

440
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
I want to cry.

441
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,333
-<i> Now, good luck,</i>
<i>and as Mama used to say,</i>

442
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,066
"Don't fuck it up."

443
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:22,867
-<i> Your mama workin' it out?</i>

444
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,500
- Oh, she is. She is.

445
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,567
-<i> She workin' you out?</i>

446
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,533
- She's teaching me
a new dance.

447
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,200
- I just want to see.

448
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,433
- I wanted the blue one.

449
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:32,800
- Cloris Leachman
is providing us

450
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,233
<i>with her own clothing line,</i>
<i>called Clorisline.</i>

451
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,734
<i>And it's probably a good idea</i>
<i>to incorporate</i>

452
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:40,066
something in that
since she's a judge.

453
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,767
- Mama, look what I got you.

454
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:46,533
- Your homework is to shave,
shave, shave, shave.

455
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,967
<i>The challenge for today is,</i>

456
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,467
we got a group
of older gentlemen

457
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,066
which we are to transform
into our drag mothers.

458
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,100
A lot of shaving.

459
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
- I guess it grew back.

460
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,233
- Just a little.
[laughs]

461
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,967
The twist is that we have to do
a mother-daughter lip-sync.

462
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:05,433
-<i> ♪ All the drama takes</i>
<i>center stage ♪</i>

463
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,233
- I yelled at my mother,
and look,

464
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,633
she's on the couch with her
heels on learning the song.

465
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,800
I said, "Bitch,
you better listen

466
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,300
to that shit ten times."

467
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
-<i> ♪ Strike up the band ♪</i>

468
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,567
- It's supposed to be
a mother-daughter, right?

469
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,533
So I'm dividing it up
between the two of us.

470
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,567
-<i> I know that Michael</i>
<i>has ideas,</i>

471
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,233
and he's definitely
making them known,

472

<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>when it comes down to it,</i>

473
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,100
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>that would be sent home,</i>

474
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,800
so I have to really get
my vision out there.

475
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,867
My style of performing is,
I don't have a plan.

476
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:32,900
- No plan?

477
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,367
- When I'm by myself,
I have no plan.

478
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,133
- I'm confused
about whose line is what.

479
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,533
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,900
<i>Um, where's mine?</i>
<i>'Cause I just wrote it down.</i>

482
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,533
- No, not me.

483
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,333
- Okay.

484
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,767
- Tatianna's mom looks
really pissed off.

485
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,500
- [sighs]

486
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,734
- Uh-uh, more attitude.

487
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,567
Do the hip.

488
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:00,900
The time has come for us to do
the runway and rehearse, honey.

489
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,433
We only have 20 minutes.

490
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,867
Hold your head up high,
miss honey.

491
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,300
And then right up here,
we gonna stop,

492
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,200
flirt, kind of rub yourself
a little bit like this, right?

493
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>Pretend you're Celine Dion.</i>

494
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,867
Do you feel sexy?

495
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,500
Confidence.
- Uhh...

496
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,600
- Without confidence,
we're Tatianna.

497
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,900
-<i> ♪ Disco ♪</i>

<i>♪ At the front door ♪</i>

500
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,934
- We both have a similar idea
of what we want to do.

501
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,533
-<i> ♪ This is the main event ♪</i>

<i>♪ Are you ready ♪</i>

503
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,633
- Michael was definitely
telling me

504
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,600
<i>about how he used to work</i>
<i>at a disco.</i>

505
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,767
So he really felt a connection
to the music.

506
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,200
<i>I did so poorly last challenge,</i>

507
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,934
and I really want
to make that up to the judges

508
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,200
<i>and make them see</i>
<i>that they kept me for a reason.</i>

509
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,300
I'm happy!

510
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,800
- Good.

511
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,934
- I'm just trying
to figure out clothes.

512
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,967
And it's really because
they haven't liked

513
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,500
a lot of stuff
that I've done on the runway

514
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
that I'm like, "Okay."

515
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,767
Just staring at my wardrobe,
thinking,

516
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,133
"What the fuck
am I gonna do?"

517
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,433
- Is this supposed
to be incorporated

518
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,500
into what you're creating?

519
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,066
- We can, we don't have to,

520
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,533
but I really want it to be fun

521
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,433
and, like, a little
over-the-top.

522
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:18,333
We are gonna be judged on
how well we transfer my essence,

523
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,533
<i>the essence of Pandora.</i>

524
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,700
<i>So if my essence</i>
<i>is bad fashion,</i>

525
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,767
then my mom's gettin'
bad fashion too.

526
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,800
-<i> Rub it in.</i>

527
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Like, caressing your own body

528
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,834
and then just shoot it
out of your fingertips.

529
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,667
Just really extend your fingers.

530
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,266
- My drag mother and I
are going to do

531
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,967
a little cha-cha
that she taught me,

532
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,066
<i>and the reason is because</i>
<i>when we're onstage,</i>

533
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:41,000
<i>the judges are going to see me</i>
<i>and my drag mother.</i>

534
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,800
So I want them to see a part
of my drag mother in me.

535
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,500
Four, um, two, three--

536
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,867
-<i> Oh, this is the dance.</i>

537
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:53,633
Yeah, so it was two, three,
four, and one.

538
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,767
See, I've changed
the choreography already.

539
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,266
-<i> While rehearsing</i>
<i>with my drag mother,</i>

540
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,200
<i>every time she would start</i>
<i>over, she would change it.</i>

541
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,367
I'm a little scared.

542
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,600
<i>I don't have much time</i>
<i>to learn,</i>

543
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,133
and I don't want him
to mess up either

544
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,066
because he'll be dancing
in heels.

545
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:08,066
We probably need
to try that again.

546
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,333
- Have you ever put on
panty hose before?

547
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,533
- No.

548
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:14,967
- Can you do a running
back handspring?

549
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,200
So we get out
onto the main stage

550
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,300
for our 20 minutes of rehearsal.

551
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,066
<i>My drag mom has bad eyes.</i>

552
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,200
So I can see her standing there

553
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,467
and kind of, like, looking like,
"Where are you?"

554
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,266
<i>as I walk out there,</i>
<i>and I know that the lights</i>

555
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:26,433
<i>are gonna be even brighter,</i>
<i>so I'm like, "This bitch</i>

556
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,500
is not gonna be able to see
what she's doing."

557
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,233
Try walking by yourself.

558
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,934
You're so dainty about it.

559
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,266
[laughter]

560
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,900
Stop.

561
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,633
Put your hand on your hip
and then turn.

562
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,567
- Turn.
- All the way around.

563
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,533
- Okay.

564
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,467
- And then walk back.

565
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, stand there.</i>

566
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,567
<i>"Basically you follow my lead.</i>

567
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,533
"Do what I do.

568
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,734
<i>Don't fall off the stage."</i>

569
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,934
<i>And just stay there, yeah.</i>

570
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:53,967
And then bring your hand down.

571
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,467
Put it over your heart.

572
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:56,567
<i>She needs direction.</i>

573
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,333
<i>Like, she needs you to say,</i>

574
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,367
<i>"This is where we're going.</i>

575
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,433
<i>"This is when we're walking.</i>

576
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,767
This is what we're doing."

577
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:05,233
Turn. Walk toward each other.

578
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,233
Is that too much for you?

579
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,300
- No, it's okay.

580
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,867
- Okay, so go to that corner
over there.

581
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:13,667
So I'm hoping she doesn't fall
or break something.

582
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,834
<i>Pretty easy, right?</i>

583
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,934
- Uh, no.

584
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,633
This is a lot to learn.

585
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,633
-<i> ♪ Chapter two ♪</i>

586
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,934
<i>♪ Turn another page ♪</i>

587
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,667
-<i> We literally only had</i>
<i>about ten minutes</i>

588
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,066
<i>to hear the song before.</i>

589
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:28,533
<i>The lip-sync isn't down</i>
<i>for either of us.</i>

590
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:29,600
I mean, I don't know the song,

591
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,834
my drag mother
doesn't know the song,

592
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,266
but really, it's rehearsal time,

593
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,200
so we have to go through
the choreography.

594
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,533
And then this is where
I'll pose,

595
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,500
and you do something
a little dirty.

596
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,233
-<i> ♪ Starts to fade ♪</i>

597
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,367
- Creating a monster.

598
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:41,800
- I think I am.

599

<i>I think I've created a monster.</i>

600
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,467
Back, Litter Boxx.
Back to your spot.

601
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,900
-<i> My mother's hairy.</i>

602
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,500
My mother has hairy arms,
hairy knuckles,

603
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
hairy back, and that beard
is going buh-bye.

604
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,734
- Raven's, uh, grooming.

605
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,734
- Beauty salon.

606
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,133
I had to shave
my fucking mother.

607
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,567
So you're done, Mama.

608
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,333
- Thank you, daughter.

609
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,266
- How do you feel, Mama?

610
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,100
- The performance
is gonna be difficult.

611
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,433
I wasn't expecting that.

612
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,567
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

613
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,800
to memorize all these lyrics.

614
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,567
- I'm gonna go sit down.
I'm exhausted.

615
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,834
- Yeah, go ahead.

616
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,300
-<i> None of these bitches</i>
<i>better die overnight.</i>

617
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,066
They better not.

618
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,066
Gonna come back tomorrow,

619
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,567
"Your mother died last night."

620
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,734
- [laughing]

621
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,967
- Morning.
- Hello.

622
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,433
- Well, it's your day of beauty,
Mother.

623
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,066
- So today our challenge is,

624
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,300
we have to turn
a 60-year-old man

625
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,066
<i>into our drag mother.</i>

626
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,900
<i>They need to embody</i>
<i>our persona,</i>

627
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,633
<i>and they have to perform</i>
<i>with us a lip-sync</i>

628
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,700
to<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> by RuPaul.</i>

629
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you excited for today?

630
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,066
- Yeah.

631
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:59,300
I'll be more excited
when I find out that you stay.

632
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,367
-<i> It's definitely odd</i>
<i>to be bonding</i>

633
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:03,800
<i>with someone twice my age,</i>

634
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,500
but I already feel very close
to my drag mom.

635
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,100
- It's nerve-racking.

636
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,066
- It is.
- [laughs]

637
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,433
- I've never had a drag mother
before.

638
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:14,300
I'm so happy.

639
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,066
- It might be easier,
because, you know,

640
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,633
you might get makeup on it
if you take it off after.

641
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,800
- Oh.

642
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,533
- Oh, God.

643
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,834
<i>My drag mother, Litter Boxx,</i>

644
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,767
has arrived in a red, white,
and blue bikini.

645
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,900
- You blowin' me?

646
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,600
- All I thought is,
"Just do the makeup.

647
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
"Just do the makeup.

648
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,567
<i>"Do the makeup, Pandora.</i>

649
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,300
<i>Don't look."</i>

650
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,700
- Who is Oscar Wilde?

651
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,467
- I went--who is Oscar Wilde?

652
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,133
Who is Oscar Wilde?

653
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,567
- Oh, my gosh, are you serious?

654
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,166
-<i> Who is Oscar Wilde?</i>

655
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,066
- That's no homosexual
over there.

656
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:57,066
- We are here to educate
the young.

657
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:00,300
- She told me, and I was like,
"Great, fantastic."

658
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,834
- There is a pantheon
one should learn.

659
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:04,934
- Look straight up
at the ceiling.

660
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,166
- Mm-hmm.

661
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,133
- Oh, I'm sure he knows
Harvey Milk with all the--

662
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,700
- Yes.
- Can y'all stop talking to her?

663
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,133
'Cause she needs to close
her eyes.

664
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,567
- Okay.

665
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,667
- Well, he can close his eyes
and talk at the same time.

666
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,600
- Well, obviously she can't,
because she's opening her eyes.

667
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,066
I was just like, "Mom,
get your shit together!"

668
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,700
-<i> I'm just a little worried</i>
<i>about the time constraint,</i>

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,633
getting not only myself
but Annalisha ready too.

670
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:31,800
- And then pull that up.

671
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,400
<i>I'm getting my mom dressed,</i>

672
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,233
and I realized that Mom
doesn't have the body

673
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,600
that I need Mom to have.

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,567
[duct tape ripping]

675
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:42,800
<i>So I took duct tape and I put</i>
<i>duct tape all around Mom</i>

676
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,066
just to give her the hips
that she needed

677
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,467
and that she deserved.

678
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,934
- No, I'm not.

- Santino, how are you tonight?

686
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,700
- You are making a spectacle
of yourself, Ru.

687

- Really?
- And I love it. I love it.

691
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,133
<i>Debbie Reynolds, you are</i>

692
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,133
and you will always be
America's sweetheart.

693
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,233
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

694
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,066
- Thank you for having me here.

695
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,934
- Toni Ko, you're finally here.

696
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,233
- How are you?

697
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:40,166
-<i> The girls love NYX Cosmetics.</i>

698
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,433
<i>It's fantastic!</i>

699
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,834
Well, we have a show for you
tonight.

700
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,800
This week, our ladies
were challenged

701
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,867
to transform a silver fox
into a golden girl.

702
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:54,333
<i>Are you ready for a little</i>
<i>mother-daughter fashion show?</i>

703
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,367
Gentlemen, start your engines,

704
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,633
and may the best woman win!

705
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:06,266
This is Raven and her
drag mother, Golda Lamé.

706
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:09,367
-<i> She's totally freaked out</i>
<i>about walking.</i>

707
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,266
<i>I just was very nervous</i>
<i>that she was gonna fall.</i>

708
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,533
<i>I mean, doesn't walk in heels,</i>

709
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:17,467
<i>but she's sparkling,</i>
<i>and she's loving it.</i>

710
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,100
-<i> Mama mia!</i>

711
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,166
[laughter]

712
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,533
<i>A cougar and her cub.</i>

713
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:26,567
<i>Pandora Boxx and her</i>
<i>drag mother, Litter Boxx.</i>

714
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,233
<i>This is the Boxx family.</i>

715
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,600
- And she's gonna show us
her box later?

716
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,433
[laughter]

717
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,066
- Oh, dear God.

718
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,800
-<i> I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>about our outfits.</i>

719
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,066
<i>They're kind of, like,</i>
<i>you know, showgirl today,</i>

720
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,266
<i>showgirl yesterday.</i>

721
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,066
<i>There's sense of comedy</i>
<i>about it.</i>

722
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,200
-<i> It's 10:00.</i>

723
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,467
<i>Do you know where your</i>
<i>drag mother is?</i>

724
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,767
<i>This is Jujubee</i>
<i>and the Contessa Touché.</i>

725
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,667
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>is feeling spectacular.</i>

726
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,967
<i>She has stepped</i>
<i>into the boundary of Jujubee,</i>

727
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,333
<i>and she feels wonderful.</i>

728
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,433
-<i> "I'm pretty, Mama.</i>

729
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,934
<i>I'm a pretty girl."</i>

730
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:02,066
<i>Tatianna and her drag mother,</i>
<i>Annalisha.</i>

731
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,900
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>does have a limp,</i>

732
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,633
<i>but, um, she's pushing</i>
<i>through it,</i>

733
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,667
<i>and she's not letting it</i>
<i>stop her.</i>

734
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:08,867
[laughter]

735
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,300
- No, you are gonna phone me
later.

736
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,200
<i>- Tyra Sanchez and her mother,</i>
<i>Big Tyra.</i>

737
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,633
-<i> My drag mother was having</i>
<i>a very good time on the runway.</i>

738
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,734
<i>She has the attitude,</i>
<i>she has the walk,</i>

739
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,433
<i>and she has the smile.</i>

740
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,467
<i>She was very comfortable</i>
<i>and confident in drag.</i>

741
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,800
-<i> The apple bottom don't fall</i>
<i>far from the tree.</i>

742
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,367
[laughter]

743
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,700
- It's time for our mothers
and daughters

744
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,066
to make their performance debut.

745
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:39,500

00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,667
<i>We're having fun, we're campy,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking</i>

765
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,867
<i>that I'm giving the judges</i>

766
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:41,867

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,533
and we were very confident
in our routine.

771
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:54,300
<i>She just let loose,</i>
<i>and she wowed the judges</i>

772
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
<i>and put a smile</i>
<i>on everyone's face.</i>

773
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,467
And so I thought it went great.

774
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,867
-<i> ♪ Strike up the band ♪</i>

-<i> After we've run through it,</i>
<i>you know, a million times,</i>

778
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
<i>and she freezes kind of,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>

779
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,633
<i>"Mom, my place</i>
<i>in the competition</i>

780

781
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,700

Go, mamas! Go!

785

-<i> I can tell</i>
<i>she's getting tired.</i>

786
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,533
And I can sense, like,
she's not gonna make it back.

787
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,233
<i>So as the music ends,</i>

788
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>I grab her and take her</i>
<i>to the back.</i>

789
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,066
-<i> Yay!</i>

790
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:31,133
[cheers and applause]

791
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,433
- 'Cause, I mean,
I would do that for my mom.

792
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,667
-<i> Gorgeous!</i>

793
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,467
- Will they do that for me
when I leave here?

794
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,567
- Yes, they will, absolutely.

795
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,667
- Thank you. That'd be good.

796
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,834
-<i> Hello, ladies.</i>

797
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:44,367
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the next generation.

798
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:46,700
I'm having a senior moment...

799
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,367
and I'm loving it!

800
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,200
Raven, let's start with you.

801
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,066
- This is Ms. Golda Lamé.

802
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:57,567
- Let's take a look
at your drag mother before.

803
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,266
<i>Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

804
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:02,300
- We used a dark brown
eye shadow.

805
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,467
We didn't want to use pencil
because it looks a little harsh.

806
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:07,233
- I can see that you're wearing
the exact same makeup.

807
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,400
- I am.

808
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300
- You guys coordinate
without matching too much,

809
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,400
<i>and it works</i>
<i>for both body types.</i>

810
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,900
- Your lip-sync
was very, very good too,

811
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,066
which I noticed right away,
because in films,

812
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,200
that's what we always did.

813
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,867
I mean, people thought
we were really singing.

814
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:22,533
Well, we did sing, but we had
to then sing to our record,

815
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:25,533
so it's not easy
to lip-sync correctly,

816
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,066
<i>and you did a super job.</i>

817
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:30,400
<i>And I've never seen anybody</i>
<i>quite dance like the mother.</i>

818
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,633
You won't give Ginger Rogers
any contest, you know?

819
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,200
[laughter]

820
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,400
- Raven, is there anything
you want to say?

821
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,633
- Thank you for this experience

822
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:41,934
and for allowing me to work
with Steven.

823
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:46,867
I respect Steven so much
because he did a lot

824
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,734
as far as the gay rights
liberation.

825
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:49,867
I thank you.

826
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:50,800
- Thank you.

827
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,333
-<i> Aw!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
[applause]

828
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,700
- It's because
of people like Steven

829
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,300
that we are able
to do this show.

830
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:01,467
Pandora Boxx, please introduce
your drag mother.

831
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,734
- This is my drag mother,
Litter Boxx.

832
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:04,700
-<i> Aw!</i>

833
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,767
Hi, Litter.
Welcome.

834
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:07,967
Now, Pandora, your drag mother

835
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,266
also has a reputation
for being a nudist.

836
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,600
- It's a lot easier
being a nudist

837
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,700
than it is being a drag queen.

838
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,567
- I agree.
[laughter]

839
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,767
- Is she wearing her Clorisline
panties underneath the outfit?

840
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,133
- She is--I hope she's wearing
some panties.

841
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:24,533
- Now let's take a look
at your drag mother before.

842
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,066
<i>Wow.</i>

843
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,166
-<i> I wanted her to look like</i>
<i>a more mature version of me.</i>

844
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,934
I wanted to do a softer liner.

845
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,266
- You look like me!

846
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:33,934
- I thought so too!

847
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,734
- I love the high energy
and the comedy,

848
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,266
and I love Mom coming out
and giving us attitude

849
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,567
<i>and you pulling her back like,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm so embarrassed."</i>

850
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,066
- Mom was wanting to shine
and give more and more,

851
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,533
and you were kind of
pulling her back,

852
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:45,567
and that was--

853
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:46,767
- Had the mother been drinking?

854
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,700
[laughter]

855
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
- Jujubee.

856
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,266
- This is my mother,
Contessa Touché.

857
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,633
-<i> Oh, wow.</i>

858
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:57,967
-<i> We're going</i>
<i>for the natural look.</i>

859
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,400
-<i> Yes, of course.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Of course.

860
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,233
I did do a little eye shadow

861
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,867
to just kind of cut
into the cheek,

862
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,567
down the rims of the nose.

863
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:08,066
I used my Ru glue
to cover the eyebrows.

864
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:13,667
- I really wish Mama
would have had a longer do.

865
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,934
- The one thing that I thought
you did too much of was,

866
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,233
<i>your mouth was open so wide,</i>
<i>and all the words--</i>

867
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,266
<i>lip-syncing, you don't need</i>
<i>to do that.</i>

868
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:26,834
- Mama's lip-sync kind of
fell apart in a couple places.

869
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:27,900
- Tatianna.

870
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,667
- This is Annalisha.

871
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,233
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

872
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:33,700
-<i> We actually used a little bit</i>
<i>of, like, a red lipstick</i>

873
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,133
<i>to counteract the beard color.</i>

874
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,567
I used the pink blush
on the apples of the cheek

875
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:39,700
<i>just to give a little flush.</i>

876
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,834
- I would've used
a brighter color lips.

877
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,800
- Older ladies do not wear
dark brown lips

878
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
unless they're Judy Davis.

879
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,667
-<i> I thought your lip-sync</i>
<i>was very good.</i>

880
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,900
The walker killed me.
I loved it a lot.

881
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,800
- Your facial expression too,
I loved it.

882
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,333
<i>I thought it added</i>
<i>to the whole performance.</i>

883
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,533
- You were really funny.

884
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,100
- Thank you.

885
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,467
- Tyra Sanchez.

886
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,266
- My drag mother's name
is Tyra,

887
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:02,066
which makes me
the other Tyra.

888
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,400
- That's right.

889
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,567
-<i> Oh!</i>

890
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:06,934
-<i> I mixed a couple</i>
<i>of the colors together</i>

891
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:08,900
<i>to get her skin color,</i>

892
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,467
and then I took
some of the blush

893
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,100
<i>and I put just a little</i>
<i>on her cheeks,</i>

894
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,300
<i>and I put, like, a nice</i>
<i>metallic silver onto her bone</i>

895
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,934
to make her eyes stand out
a little bit more.

896
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,633
- There's a lot of fun
in that hair.

897
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:21,233
<i>Your style translated</i>
<i>onto your mother.</i>

898
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,734
You're the only one who really
did identical outfits.

899
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:24,967
-<i> I should've known you'd have</i>

900
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:27,834
a classy Park Avenue
fashionable mother.

901
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,433
<i>On Mom, though, I might have</i>
<i>toned the lip down.</i>

902
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:32,066
<i>The makeup's a little heavy.</i>

903
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,633
- Now, Debbie Reynolds
is quite the hoofer.

904
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,767
- I knew you'd--I knew
she'd pick right up on that.

905
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,834
<i>The dancing,</i>
<i>it was exceptional,</i>

906
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,367
<i>choreography, the stage work.</i>

907
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:44,100
<i>The mother, with the hair,</i>
<i>could've been a little less,</i>

908
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,133
but then, you know, uh,
that's the kick of it.

909
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,400
- Thank you, ladies.

910
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,333
Now, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

911
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,266
<i>in the Interior Illusions</i>
<i>Lounge,</i>

912
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,600
the judges and I
will deliberate.

913
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,934
[engine starting]

914
00:34:56,934 --> 00:35:00,066
All right, just between
us girls.

915
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,166
<i>First up, we had Raven.</i>

916
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,100
- Raven did a great job
with the transformation.

917
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,900
Her mother did look like Raven.

918
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,800
-<i> She did have</i>
<i>the essence of Raven.</i>

919
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
What really carried the day
for me

920
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
is that Raven seemed
so protective of her mother,

921
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,500
<i>who's a tiny little person</i>
<i>who couldn't walk in heels,</i>

922
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,800
and we haven't seen that many
sweet sides to Raven,

923
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,667
<i>and the mother brought out</i>
<i>the sweetness in her.</i>

924
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,066
- You just kind of really felt
a kinship growing.

925
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,667
It's gonna be
a buddy system there.

926
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,834
- That's what we're about here
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>

927
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,300
putting families together.

928
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,967
<i>Pandora Boxx and her mother.</i>

929
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,934
- Pandora's mother, Litter Boxx,

930
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:35,166
<i>actually was funnier</i>
<i>and kind of stole the show.</i>

931
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,867
- And I thought the mother
was really playing a part too.

932
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,367
She was playing the tough mama.

933
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,166
- Her mother kind of
showed her up a little bit.

934
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,433
-<i> Jujubee.</i>

935
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,800
Cloris, you commented
that her mouth was just open.

936
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,867
She was doing the old trick,

937
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:46,867
<i>"Peas and carrots," you know,</i>

938
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,166
<i>when you don't know the words?</i>

939
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,100
- It put me off
because it was so exaggerated

940
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,500
<i>that it wasn't real.</i>

941
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,567
- Well, that's what I'm looking
for in my drag queens:

942
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:54,667
realness.

943
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,633
- They both look very beautiful
and exotic,

944
00:35:56,633 --> 00:36:00,133
but I just did not like
that hair.

945
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,367
-<i> Tatianna.</i>

946
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,667
- I had so many other things
written on other people

947
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,100
that I only have "wheelchair"
written there,

948
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,367
<i>and if you can make anything</i>
<i>out of that...</i>

949
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,567
[laughter]

950
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,066
And wonderful design, I think,
of the dresses.

951
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,567
- I have to say, I liked her
mother's dress better than hers.

952
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:17,166
<i>I thought that long dress</i>
<i>made the mother look</i>

953
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,800
<i>like she had a great,</i>
<i>sexy body.</i>

954
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,300
- Really, overall,
I think Tatianna

955
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,100
might have pulled it out
this week.

956
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,166
-<i> Tyra Sanchez.</i>

957
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,100
- I just thought Tyra
was so beautiful,

958
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,333
even though
you didn't ask me yet.

959
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,266
[laughter]

960
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,166
- Well, this is the--
this is the moment now.

961
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,400
<i>Oh, you're giving a--</i>

962
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,166
- Ooh!
-<i> Oh!</i>

963
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,333
I did think the mother's makeup
was a little crazy exaggerated.

964
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,233
- Well, I'm with Cloris.
I vote ten.

965
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,533
<i>They were very chic.</i>

966
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,166
<i>I didn't like the mother's wig,</i>
<i>of course not,</i>

967
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,834
but obviously, it was
a little bit of humor there.

968
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,700
- So is that a ten or what?

969
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,667
- I vote for a ten, yeah.

970
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,367
- Ten, that's three tens.

971
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,834
[laughter]

972
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,867
- Okay, silence.

973
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:56,667
<i>I have made my decision.</i>

974
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,200
Bring back the girls.

975
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,600
<i>Welcome back.</i>

976
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,367
At this point, it's not about

977
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,900
who's the worst.

978
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,266
<i>It's about who's the best</i>
<i>of the best,</i>

979
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:14,567
the next drag superstar.

980
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,900
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra,

981
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,266
you proved that two Tyras
are better than one.

982
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:23,333
<i>You're safe.</i>

983
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,066
- Thank you.

984
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:32,066
- Tatianna, this week,
you came from behind

985
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:35,767
and rolled over the competition.

986
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,300
<i>You're safe.</i>

987
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,400
- Thank you.

988
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,166
Thank you.

989
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,233
- Pandora Boxx,
you're a funny girl,

990
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:54,066
but tonight you were
outperformed.

991
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:57,066
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

992
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,900
-<i> I thought that I was campy</i>
<i>and fun.</i>

993
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,533
<i>I really gave it my all.</i>

994
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,300
<i>I really, really worked hard.</i>

995
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,467
It's like a kick in the balls.

996
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:07,467
- Raven, for giving
the most dramatic makeover

997
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:11,667
<i>and literally carrying</i>
<i>Golda Lamé,</i>

998
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,166
proving that she ain't heavy;
she's your mama--

999
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,767
<i>Raven, congratulations,</i>

1000
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,567
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.

1001
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:19,567
- Thank you.

1002
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,734
[applause]

1003
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,500
-<i> You and your drag mother</i>

1004
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,734

<i>at the luxurious East Canyon</i>
<i>Hotel and Spa in Palm Springs.</i>

1006
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:33,934
- I felt so amazing,

1007
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:35,467
<i>and I knew that Tatianna</i>
<i>was back there</i>

1008
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,333
<i>just grinding her toenails</i>

1009
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,166
in the tip of her fucking heel.

1010
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,467
Thank you, Tatianna,
for picking out my mother.

1011
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:50,066
- Jujubee, you are
a special queen.

1012
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:53,166
<i>But tonight, you and your</i>
<i>mother were out of sync.</i>

1013
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:57,467
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1014
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,734
-<i> I'm in the bottom,</i>

1015
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,767
and I can't blame anybody
but myself.

1016
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,800
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>

1017
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,066
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1018
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:11,367
<i>and save yourself</i>
<i>from elimination.</i>

1019
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:18,433
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.

1020
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:24,367
Good luck,

1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,038
        - Sashay away.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,806
   Can I get an amen in here?

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,607
        Sashay away.

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,109
   Can I get an amen in here?

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,044
        Good luck.              
        Sashay away.

6
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,211
   Can I get an amen in here?

7
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,512
    How the hell can you love   
somebody else?

8
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:20,481
   Can I get an amen in here?

9
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:26,420
        And don't fuck it up.

10
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:31,090
        - Oh, my God.

11
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:31,757
            Hey.

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,293
        I am Peppermint,        
    and I am sweet and sassy.

13
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:39,263
       Yes. I perform           
    and host in New York.

14
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:40,163
                When you come   
        to a Peppermint show,

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,198
   you're gonna see people      
screaming and hollering,

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,501
     money flying and you're    
     gonna feel special.

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,602
        I look great.           
        Perfect.

18
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:50,138
            My braids           
     are sitting just right.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,105
    I got it going on.

20
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:54,174
               All right,       
       let's get to work.

21
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:01,647
            - Hello.            
       It's me, Valentina.

22
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:04,081
    (speaking Spanish)

23
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,749
      Who am I? Valentina.

24
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:06,549
        I'm 25 years old.

25
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,552
    I'm from Echo Park,         
    California.

26
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:10,452
            Sass.

27
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:11,586
        Hey, beauty.            
        - Valentina.

28
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:13,721
    I'm Peppermint.             
    - (speaking Spanish)

29
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:14,488
             Mwah.              
             - Mwah.

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,656
    My type of drag,            
    it's very dramatic,

31
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,759
                very theatrical 
        and always very Latina.

32
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,128
    I'm an undiscovered         
        superstar.

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,462
    I've always dreamed         
    of being in here,

34
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,096
    and here we are, girlfriend.

35
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,064
      - Here we are, girl.

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,133
    - Oh, come on, give it up

37
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:35,170
    for the big girl            
    serving pure catfish.

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,139
    My name is Eureka,          
    and I am 25 years old.

39
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,775
   People would categorize me   
       as a pageant queen,

40
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:48,313
       but to me, my drag       
    is the genre of fabulous.

41
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:48,713
                        (laughs)

42
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,748
         Hi, I'm Eureka.

43
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,549
    - Where are you from?       
    - East Tennessee.

44
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,150
    Girl, I'm country           
    as a biscuit, honey,

45
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:54,917
   and I love eating 'em, too.

46
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,752
                Your hair's hot.

47
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,820
    - Thank you, girl.          
    - I love the baby hairs.

48
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:01,289
- I'm a little natural around   
the way, girl, you know.

49
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,758
   - That's my favorite shape   
            is round.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,659
        - I can see.

51
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:08,494
         - I'll eat you.

52
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,195
        (all laugh)

53
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:12,530
        - Hi, hi, hi.

54
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,532
     It's about to get shady    
           up in here.

55
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,669
    My name is Charlie Hides    
    and I'm (muffled) years old.

56
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,304
        (door creaks)

57
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,038
            - Hey!              
            - Hey!

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,073
    - Oh, my God,               
    Peppermint's here.

59
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,075
   - I'm known as a celebrity   
impersonator.

60
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:29,111
         My drag persona        
         is rude, crude,

61
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:30,445
    socially unacceptable       
    and over the top.

62
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,213
        Can I ask you,          
        with that dress,

63
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:34,114
    why didn't you wear like    
     a big pair of earrings?

64
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:38,585
- I really wanted to give you,  
like, Walmart realness.

65
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,720
   - I'm getting that, Eureka.  
   - Thank you.

66
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,288
        (all laugh)

67
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,360
   - It's Christina Aguilera.

68
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:49,728
        - So this is what       
        it looks like.

69
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,730
        - She's naked.

70
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,731
    - My name is Farrah Moan,

71
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,632
    and I'm from                
    Las Vegas, Nevada.

72
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:56,467
      - Oh, my God, dirty.

73
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,335
    - My drag is inspired       
    by Vegas showgirls.

74
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:00,370
               My wardrobe      
       shows a lot of skin

75
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:03,339
    and there's usually         
    a feather or two

76
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,074
     or five dead ostriches.

77
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,375
     You never know with me.

78
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:07,542
    Hi.                         
    - Hi, I'm Charlie.

79
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:08,709
    - Charlie.                  
    - What's your name?

80
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,143
    - Farrah. Farrah Moan.

81
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,277
         - Farrah Moan walks in.

82
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,279
          She's a twig,         
     and she looks about 12.

83
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,548
        I have underwear        
         older than her.

84
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,184
        - Hi. I'm Eureka,       
    like the vacuum cleaner.

85
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:20,717
        How are you?

86
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,019
    - I've never vacuumed       
           before.

87
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,688
       - Well, I came           
    to clean house, girl.

88
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:36,765
            - Aah!

89
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,700
             - What?

90
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:42,403
            - Aah!

91
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,706
                        (coughs)

92
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,174
        - Oh, wow.

93
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,009
   - My name is Sasha Velour.

94
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,276
    I am years 29 old.

95
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:54,747
    I am a bald, fashiony,      
     artistic weird queen.

96
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,714
        Hi, ladies.

97
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:59,718
    I'm committed to being      
    uniquely Sasha all the time.

98
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,152
    - Tell us about yourself.

99
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:01,785
    - I'm a visual artist.

100
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,354
     I love telling stories     
     with art and with drag.

101
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:07,056
    - What story are you telling
with this unibrow?

102
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:11,159
        - (laughs)

103
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:17,297
     - How do you like them     
     egg rolls, Mr. Charles?

104
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,564
      I'm Alexis Michelle,

105
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,100
    and I am New York City's    
     premier Broadway queen.

106
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,501
        Oh, shit.

107
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,670
    I went to school            
    for musical theater.

108
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,538
             I think            
    the ultimate fantasy now

109
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,673
   would be to be on Broadway   
            in drag.

110
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,408
    - Girl.                     
    - Come on, New York.

111
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,476
       - So the east coast      
      is well represented.

112
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,745
       - I will say L.A.,       
           west coast,

113
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:40,280
         it's the center        
        of the universe.

114
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:41,714
                Sorry, New York.

115
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:45,283
        - She says forget       
   what you heard, apparently.

116
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,285
        Memo taken.

117
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,524
    - My name is Shea Coulee,   
   and I didn't come to play.

118
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,326
         I came to slay.

119
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:58,194
    - I love The Muppets.

120
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,395
    - I'm Shea Coulee,          
    and I'm 27 years old.

121
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:03,632
       Shea Coulee is           
    a champagne lifestyle

122
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,966
    on a lemonade budget.

123
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,534
            Hey!

124
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,501
    You're gonna get            
    a full-on production

125
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,503
    when you see Shea Coulee.

126
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:12,038
        Costumes, check.        
        Makeup, check.

127
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,272
    Dance moves, she got 'em.

128
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,607
    - Where are you from?       
    - I'm from Chicago.

129
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,041
         - Yes, Chicago.

130
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:17,508
        (all laugh)

131
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,044
      - Chicago drag is the     
   motherfucking bomb-dot-com.

132
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:23,112
        - Dot-com?              
        - Yes, bitch.

133
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,147
        It's got its own domain.

134
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:27,015
        (all laugh)

135
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:30,985
    - The body is here, bitches.

136
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:31,585
        - Oh, shit.

137
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:32,986
   - Girl, I'm Trinity Taylor.

138
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,521
    Some people say I'm the look
          and feel of real,

139
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:38,223
        but my body             
    speaks for itself.

140
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:38,790
         - Shut it down!

141
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,392
     - Trinity does not pad.

142
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:42,526
     I love plastic surgery,

143
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:46,329
    and I went from a pancake   
        to a Kardashian.

144
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:47,163
     I do a lot of pageants,

145
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:51,066
     but I don't like to use    
     the word pageant queen

146
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:55,503
      because there's such      
a stigmatism with pageant queen.

147
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:56,270
    I can do anything,

148
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,540
         from beautiful         
     to way outside the box.

149
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,576
       - Oh, my God. Lady!

150
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:05,945
    - Bitch, I'm just excited   
        I know somebody.

151
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:08,580
       Me and Trinity know      
   each other from competing.

152
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:11,449
   She, like, won the pageant   
   that I really wanted to win

153
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,385
so, of course, there's that,    
like, bougee attitude from her.

154
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,387
    - I am the body girl.

155
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,156
            I'm here            
       and I'm not padded.

156
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:21,124
        - She's gonna be        
        competition.

157
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,226
         - Who are              
    the pageant girls?

158
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,427
    You're a pageant girl,      
    I'm a pageant girl,

159
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:25,494
    you're a pageant girl.

160
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,262
    Just to clear the air,

161
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,697
    I promise I'm not           
    one of the mean ones.

162
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,099
        (all laugh)

163
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,366
                - That is a lie.

164
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:33,933
             - Oh.              
            - Ooh.

165
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,603
- There's always been tension   
with me and Eureka.

166
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,704
    Maybe she has an issue      
         with the fact

167
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,273
    that every pageant          
    that we've been in,

168
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:41,973
        I beat her.

169
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,978
           - Is it me           
      or is it hot in here?

170
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:52,081
         I'm Kimora Blac        
         from Las Vegas.

171
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,349
    The queen is here.          
    Bow down, bitches.

172
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,150
    - Oh, you ain't             
    the only body, girl.

173
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,252
            - I love            
      anything see-through

174
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,354
       and anything             
    that shows my body.

175
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,590
    Big tits, big ass,          
    irresistible.

176
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:04,557
    Gay guys love me,           
    straight guys love me.

177
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,893
    Kimora Blac is everyone's   
    sexual preference.

178
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,996
        - Hey, girl.            
        - Oh, my God!

179
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:11,463
            Oh!

180
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,331
                Oh, my goodness.

181
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,634
    - That's my Vegas sister.

182
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,369
     Kimora's ass is famous.

183
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,038
    That's what she's           
    gonna be known for.

184
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,506
    That ass is gonna have      
    its own t-shirts.

185
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,141
    I can see it all now.

186
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,575
        - Season 9, baby.

187
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:28,210
         - How long             
    you been doing drag?

188
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:29,444
         - Oh, my God,          
        10 long years.

189
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:31,712
        - Bravo.                
        - 10 long years.

190
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:34,314
        - 10 months.

191
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:35,682
    - And you can go to hell.

192
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,384
    - My debut was 10 months ago
when I performed.

193
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:42,588
    - I can't. I can't.         
    I can't with her.

194
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,323
    - I'm fairly new to drag,

195
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,290
         but I wouldn't         
         consider myself

196
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,191
         looking like           
    an amateur drag queen.

197
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:49,493
    I carry myself like a winner
          and a superstar.

198
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:54,197
    - Come on, drag queen.      
    - (laughs)

199
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,032
    - Hi, shape-shifters.

200
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:01,436
        - I am Jaymes Mansfield,

201
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:02,537
    I am 26 years old,

202
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:03,604
        and I'm from            
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

203
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,139
                I build puppets.

204
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,140
    I'm a kooky, comedy queen

205
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,976
      that has way more         
up her sleeve than they know.

206
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:14,480
        All right.

207
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,982
   - Jaymes Mansfield looks...

208
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:20,385
    scared and confused         
    when she walks in.

209
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,453
               Like, am I       
       in the right room?

210
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:25,322
    - Hi, honey.                
    - Oh, my goodness.

211
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:26,256
        - These are my          
        summer diamonds.

212
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,724
        Some are diamonds       
        and some are not.

213
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,425
        (all laugh)

214
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,560
    - Is this all fake          
    or is it real?

215
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:35,764
    - Um, I'd say the foot      
    upward, it's all fake.

216
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,399
   - I meant your personality.

217
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,268
            - Ooh.              
            - Ooh.

218
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,006
    - I'm Nina Bo'nina,         
    banana fo-fana,

219
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:50,410
     Osama bin Laden, Brown,    
     boom, boom, boom, boom.

220
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:51,344
        I am Nina Bo'nina Brown,

221
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,780
    and I am back in town       
    to shut her down.

222
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:55,747
    Well, no, I can't say       
    I'm back in town,

223
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,715
    'cause I haven't even       
    been in town yet.

224
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,283
        - Yes, ma'am.

225
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,684
   - She seems a little mousy.

226
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,585
         - Hey, sisters.

227
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,386
            - Yay!              
            - Yes.

228
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:06,554
          - My drag             
    consists of fantasy.

229
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,155
               One minute       
       I may be a zombie.

230
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:09,389
         The next time          
         I may be a nun.

231
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,524
                I'm not cosplay.

232
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,691
    Nobody does what I do.

233
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:13,425
   - What inspired your look?

234
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,628
    - Well, you know, my drag   
    is like universal, honey.

235
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,729
                You never know  
        what you're gonna get.

236
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,230
   - So your drag's like STDs.

237
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,731
                You never know  
        what you're gonna get.

238
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,300
        - Exactly.

239
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,068
            - Oh!               
            - Oh!

240
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,005
        - My name is Aja and I'm
        from Brooklyn, New York.

241
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,973
           Your edges           
    are officially snatched.

242
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,241
             - Yeah.

243
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,509
         - Aja is vangy.

244
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,578
    Her drag style is very      
    the streets of Tokyo

245
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,679
        meets the streets       
        of Brooklyn.

246
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,313
         She's cute,            
    but she's dangerous.

247
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,550
     - Oh, my. I am so happy    
           to see you.

248
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,251
         - I'm so happy.        
         - I love Aja.

249
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:52,255
   She is the number one name   
           in Brooklyn

250
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,423
             that people        
    are talking about right now.

251
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:57,025
    - Hi. Aja. Mwah, mwah.

252
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,092
     Oh, you are so gorgeous    
            in blue.

253
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:00,494
     - Thank you, thank you.    
     So nice to meet you.

254
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:03,396
   Aja's makeup is just really  
rough around the edges,

255
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:07,166
        but she comes off       
        as confident.

256
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,434
        Does she know           
    what she looks like?

257
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,169
    'Cause if not,              
    I need to tell her.

258
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:13,704
    - I feel like I'm at home   
    with so much talented girls.

259
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:17,407
            - Yes!              
             - Oh!

260
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:22,210
            - Oh!

261
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:22,610
                        - Bitch!

262
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,545
      - Yes, ma'am, honey.

263
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:28,549
     - That's a damn good       
     Lady Gaga impersonator.

264
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,484
        - Oh, girl.             
        - Oh, my God.

265
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,286
      So this is the Derek Barry
            of the season.

266
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:37,089
            - Oh!

267
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:38,757
                - Yo, I'm Ronnie
        and I'm from New Jersey.

268
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,193
   I'm New Jersey's number one  
   Lady Gaga impersonator.

269
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,561
    But what I'm really         
    excited about

270
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,329
      is how long it takes

271
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:49,299
for these queens to figure out  
that it's really me.

272
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:56,205
        - Is it time to go home?

273
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:57,606
        - (laughs)

274
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:00,609
                - Wait a minute.

275
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,979
          - The winner          
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

276
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,180

        of $100,000.

283
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,868

284
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:38,474
        (screaming)

285
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:43,278
    - Holy fucking balls,       
    it's Lady Gaga.

286
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,779
       Like, the real one.

287
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,248
        - Holy shit.

288
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,216
   I'm on "RuPaul's Drag Race"  
Season 9,

289
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,084
            and Lady Gaga       
    is in the same room with me.

290
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,685
            Aah!

291
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:56,521
        (screaming)

292
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:57,788
        - Oh, my God.           
        Oh, my God.

293
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,490
       - I can't tell you,      
I have been the closest to death

294
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,291
         and you've             
    pulled me out of it,

295
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:03,458
   and you don't even realize   
   what you do for people

296
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,762
and how much you inspire people 
like me and all of us.

297
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,131
    And I just want to tell you,
you're so amazing,

298
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,666
and I never thought in the world
I would ever meet you.

299
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,768
         And I think            
    you're so incredible.

300
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,502
        I'm so sorry.

301
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:18,538
           I think              
    you're so incredible.

302
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,773
            - Aw.

303
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:21,740
        (applause)

304
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,477
    - You allow us to be        
    who we are as an artist.

305
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,144
        Thank you.

306
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,547
         - I have always        
         really admired

307
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,583
   the craftsmanship that       
   goes into what you all do.

308
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,052
    Drag has for me             
    been an opportunity

309
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,689
           to leave myself      
    when I didn't want to be me.

310
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,589
            - Right.            
             - Yeah.

311
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,426
 - And felt so completely out of
place when I was in high school.

312
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:47,495
     Drag has just been part    
of my life for the longest time.

313
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:49,797
    It's just really an honor   
    for me to be here,

314
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,098
       to be with you all.

315
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,666
   - No, it's an honor for us.  
   - Yes, Gaga.

316
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:57,404
    (cheers and applause)

317
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:59,672
        (door opens)

318
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:02,508
    - Hello, hello, hello!

319
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,543
    (cheers and applause)

320
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,144
        Oh, my Gaga!

321
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,545
        (all laugh)

322
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:10,347
    Gather round, ladies.

323
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:13,483
        Oh, darling, mwah, mwah.

324
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,384
        You look amazing.

325
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:16,585
     - Thank you, so do you.

326
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,321
       - Now you've had a chance
               to meet my girls.

327
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,689
     Do you have any advice     
            for them?

328
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:22,390
                - You know, when
        you're having a bad day,

329
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:23,424
    just remember               
    that I was nobody,

330
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:26,393
   and then I became somebody   
            one day.

331
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:27,794
        And it's the same       
        right here.

332
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,829
             - Ah!              
            - Yes.

333
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,530
    - Your lives are gonna      
     change forever today.

334
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:34,533
    And I would also            
    remember something

335
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,468
    that you taught me          
    a very long time ago.

336
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,602
    - Get the money up front?

337
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:40,404
     - Yes, and on the back.

338
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,305
        - (laughs)

339
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:43,539
    - Remember what             
    he always has said:

340
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,542
       ♪ You better work ♪

341
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,377
       - Turn to the left.      
       - Turn to the left.

342
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,010
             - Work.            
             - Work.

343
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,111
        - Now turn to the right.
        - Now turn to the right.

344
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:50,711
             - Work             
             - Work.

345
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,647
        - Sashay, shante.

346
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,517
    (cheers and applause)

347
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,351
    - Now, as you can see,

348
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:03,489
   this season is going to be   
stuffed with more stars,

349
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:08,060
more stunts and more shenanigans
than ever before.

350
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:10,228
             - Yeah!

351
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,829
     - And on this premiere,

352
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,731
              for the first time
      in "Drag Race" herstory...

353
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,133
                        - Uh-oh.

354
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,602
        - No one...

355
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:20,669
        is going home.

356
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,237
            - Oh!               
            - Oh!

357
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:26,207
    - (gasps) Crack, crack,     
    crack, crack, crack, pow!

358
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,808
    Face on the floor.

359
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,277
        - #OhMyGaga.

360
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,446
    And ladies, to get          
    this episode started,

361
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,315
    we're throwing a pageant.

362
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:36,815
            - Oh.               
            - Oh.

363
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,650
    - Yes, Miss Thing,

364
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:44,389
the Miss Charisma, Uniqueness,  
Nerve & Talent Pageant.

365
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:44,856
        (all laugh)

366
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:47,291
        - Yes!                  
        Oh, my God!

367
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:47,791
        I can do this.

368
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:48,525
    I want to show these bitches

369
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,627
                that I'm the one
                to look out for.

370
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,195
    - You'll be competing       
    in two categories.

371
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:56,332
   First, you need to show us   
        where you're from

372
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:59,668
          with a frock          
   inspired by your home city.

373
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,572
    Second, as a salute to      
    our legendary guest star,

374
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:05,472
    you need to strut your stuff

375
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:09,509
        in your favorite        
         Lady Gaga drag.

376
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,246
    So don't be a drag,         
    just be a queen.

377
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:17,583
    (cheers and applause)

378
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:20,085
          - Lady Gaga,          
    would you do the honors?

379
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,587
       - Gentlemen,             
    start your engines,

380
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,724
   and may the best woman win.

381
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:31,528
             - Whoo!            
             - Yes!

382
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,499
        - Move, bitch.          
        - Oh, my God, up.

383
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,533
        - Watch out now.        
        - Ow!

384
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,635
     - I'm right behind you,    
     honey. Sorry, guys.

385
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,869
    - Where am I gonna go?      
    Where am I gonna go?

386
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,670
    - This first challenge      
    is very important

387
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,673
    because this is the first   
impression that you make.

388
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,809
No one can afford to fuck       
      this shit up.

389
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,509
                - Bam, bam, bam.

390
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:50,344
    - Are they sure this        
    wasn't the challenge,

391
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,480
    'cause I feel like          
        I'm winded.

392
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:58,817
     - Is this already          
     a claimed work station?

393
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,285
            Hello?

394
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,719
     Am I missing something?

395
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,386
       Can someone tell me

396
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:05,822
if there's another station      
somewhere that I'm not seeing?

397
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:06,689
             (sighs)

398
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,557
           - Farrah             
    is awkwardly endearing

399
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,292
        with the way            
        that she whines.

400
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:14,229
           - So am I,           
   like, Matilda or something?

401
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,564
       - I call her             
    Blonde Benet Glamsy

402
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:21,335
    'cause she whines like      
    a 6-year-old, so, huh.

403
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:24,271
    - I really want             
    a station of my own.

404
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:27,440
     - So have you ever done    
     a Gaga look before?

405
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,408
- Yeah, 'cause I've played her  
 a bunch of times in my video.

406
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,309
   - Oh, yeah, in your videos.  
   - I make YouTube videos,

407
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,778
    which I make by myself      
    in my living room.

408
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,313
         I've been making fun of
 Lady Gaga on YouTube for years.

409
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,516
    I am always afraid that     
    when I impersonate people

410
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:40,416
    that they're gonna watch    
           my videos.

411
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:43,819
     Lana del Rey said I was    
     an asshole, apparently.

412
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,821
                - Lana del Rey  
        called you an asshole?

413
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,621
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:50,524
- Charlie has a very on the edge
kind of sense of humor.

415
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,691
     It's an acquired taste,

416
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:56,395
and I'm not sure if the judges  
have acquired that taste.

417
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,699
- I'm wearing the rainbow kimono
that Gaga wore.

418
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:03,234
        - Yes, bitch.

419
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:04,268
        - Coming through.

420
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,435
    - It's V collar.

421
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,236
    Oh, like it's the one.

422
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,570
        I was like, can I, like,
        go through your archives

423
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,405
    and, like, have stuff?

424
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,540
     And he was like, yeah,     
     take whatever you want.

425
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:15,809
     - Aja is very New York.

426
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,811
    "I'm from New York.         
       I did this."

427
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,746
          "Oh, my God,          
     this guy made me this."

428
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,716
   She talks about the costume  
designers and all this jazz.

429
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,218
        No one cares.

430
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,488
   - Touch it. It's arctic fox  
       dyed with saffron.

431
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:35,159
    - Oh. My hometown look      
    is a Georgia peach.

432
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:39,763
Girl, I said, how am I gonna go 
from a damn mouse to a peach?

433
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,798
        I haven't seen          
        a lot of girls

434
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,668
    who can get some paper      
     and some kind of glue

435
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,105
    and create a new face.

436
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:50,972
         I may not have         
         the best stuff,

437
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,474
   but I work with what I got,

438
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:54,475
    and I think that's          
    what makes me different.

439
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:58,212
    I just need for people      
    to believe in me.

440
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:05,519
- Ladies, who wants to win      
the first challenge the most?

441
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,586
            - Me!               
            - Me!

442
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:07,553
        - Come on, girl!        
        - Everybody.

443
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:08,353
      - Get in line, girl!

444
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,755
    - I'm about to storm        
    all you bitches.

445
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,124
    - Right. She gonna be       
    just like the candy.

446
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,358
    She gonna dissolve.         
          Ha ha!

447
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,260
    - The stakes are high       
    for this first challenge

448
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,162
    because everyone is fighting
         for that spotlight.

449
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:25,167
      - The true Gaga-rini,     
that is what's about to go down.

450
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,270
     - I feel very prepared     
           and ready.

451
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:34,108
   The only thing that I want   
   from this challenge

452
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,810
       is to beat Trinity.

453
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,346
    - Coming up....             
    - She (bleep) nailed it.

454
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,281
    - You could put Donald Trump
           in that dress,

455
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:42,981
    he's gonna look gorgeous.

456
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:45,683
   - That I don't agree with.   
           (all laugh)

457
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:48,052
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

458
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:54,924
        (applause)

459
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,526
                        - Hello.

460
00:18:58,528 --> 00:18:59,660
               Welcome to       
       the Miss Charisma,

461
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:03,430
        Uniqueness, Nerve       
        & Talent Pageant.

462
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:06,833
    Let's meet our distinguished
panel of judges.

463
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:10,937
    Fourth runner-up in the Miss
South Plainfield New Jersey

464
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,740
   Popping, Dipping, Spinning   
   and Vogue-ing Pageant,

465
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:15,841
        Michelle Visage is here.

466
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:18,443
    - Darling, I wear it        
    with pride. Thank you.

467
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:20,745
    - Style superstar,          
    Carson Kressley.

468
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:23,748
     - I love that this is      
    a scholarship pageant.

469
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,648
        Great work.

470
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,485
    - And the hilarious         
    Ross Mathews.

471
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:29,986
        - I have Vaseline       
        on my teeth.

472
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:31,854
                        - Ha ha!

473
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:34,756
    - And the one,              
    the only Lady Gaga.

474
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,291
    - Well, if you could        
        do me a favor

475
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:38,025
   and shoot me from the left

476
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,061
        and put a filter        
   on that camera, would you?

477
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,630
   - All right, Ms. Streisand.

478
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,865
         Now, to get            
    to know them better,

479
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,934
         our contestants        
    will introduce themselves

480
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:53,772
wearing frocks that represent   
their home cities.

481
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:56,474
    Let the pageant begin.

482
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:57,908
        (applause)

483
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,777
        Category is...

484
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,378
    First up, Peppermint.

485
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,946
        - Check out             
        those big apples.

486
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:07,316
     - My name is Peppermint    
     from New York City,

487
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:12,621
      home of Metro cards,      
   EBT cards and Lady Liberty.

488
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:15,523
        - That's a mint         
    I'd like to bite into.

489
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,757
        - Valentina.

490
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,892
                - Ole, you stay.

491
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:20,959
                - I'm Valentina.

492
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,794
       I'm from East L.A.

493
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:26,297
         and I'm repping        
         Mariachi Plaza.

494
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,465
                - Oh, Mary-achi.

495
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:31,401
                Next up, Eureka.

496
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:34,003
    She's the forgotten         
    Mandrell sister.

497
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,404
                        - Right.

498
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,037
         - Howdy, y'all.

499
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,706
           I'm Eureka           
    and this is Mary Jo Beth.

500
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,841
        I come to you           
    from East Tennessee,

501
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:43,844
    and I'm representing        
    the redneck woman.

502
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,378
        (all laugh)

503
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,947
   - Honky-tonk ba-donka-donk.

504
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:49,315
        Charlie Hides.

505
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:51,917
Honey, she is Thanks-giving it  
       to you, darling.

506
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,784
            - She is.

507
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,352
    - Hi. I'm Charlie           
    from Massachusetts,

508
00:20:54,354 --> 00:21:00,057
    the home of the pilgrims,   
America's first drag queens.

509
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:00,991
                - She's a witch.

510
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,994
    - Burn her!                 
    - Burn her at the stake!

511
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,528
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.

512
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,232
   - I can tell from here       
   she gives great head-dress.

513
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:10,966
    - Hi, my name's Farrah Moan.

514
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,834
   I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.

515
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,802
    Are you feeling lucky?

516
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,770
        - What happens in Vegas 
                slays in Vegas.

517
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,671
         - That's right.        
         - Yeah.

518
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,640
        - Next up, Sasha Velour.

519
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:22,874
         She's crowning.

520
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:23,941
        (all laugh)

521
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:27,544
   - Hi, I'm Sasha Velour       
   and I'm from New York City,

522
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:32,715
    home of queer modern art,   
Haring, Warhol, Basquiat.

523
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,717
    - Burger Queen.             
    She's got a Whopper.

524
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,386
    We just can't see it.

525
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:37,953
    - Alexis Michelle.

526
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,555
    - These have always         
    brought me luck.

527
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:44,725
    - I'm Alexis Michelle,      
    a native New Yorker,

528
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,561
        home of Broadway, bagels

529
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:50,530
                and an epicenter
                of civil rights.

530
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:51,697
   - Work that message, girl.

531
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:54,433
     - Darn kids have tagged    
     my swimsuit again.

532
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:57,969
   - See, it's the elder care   
        that I relate to.

533
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:59,637
        - Shea Coulee.

534
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:00,971
      - She-brew national.

535
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,840
- Don't be fooled by the brats  
that she got.

536
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:08,411
- My name's Shea Coulee         
and, bitch, I'm from Chicago!

537
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:08,878
        (all laugh)

538
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,312
   Nothing reminds me of home

539
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:15,383
     more than a big wiener     
 sandwiched in between two buns.

540
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:18,886
        - The other girls       
       better "catch up."

541
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,654
    They "must-heard" about her.

542
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,822
           I want you           
    to "relish" this moment.

543
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,957
        (all laugh)

544
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,858
        Somebody stop me.

545
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,959
        - (laughs)

546
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:28,526
         Trinity Taylor.

547
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:33,397
    - You must be this tall, Ru,
         to take that ride.

548
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,866
    - I'm Trinity Taylor        
    from Orlando, Florida,

549
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,734
    the theme park capital      
         of the world.

550
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:39,936
      Want to take a ride?

551
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,671
    - I'd take a ride           
    on her disco trick.

552
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:45,241
        - Uh-huh.               
        Kimora Blac.

553
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,442
   - Blac lives matter, y'all.

554
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,578
- Hello, my name is Kimora Blac 
from the city of Las Vegas.

555
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,813
    All the girls in Vegas      
         just know me

556
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:53,614
    as the youngest, hottest,   
skinniest queen.

557
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,916
    And if you're feeling       
    a little frisky,

558
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,351
    whatever you do to me       
    stays in Vegas.

559
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:01,587
- This message has been brought 
to you by penicillin.

560
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,789
        (all laugh)

561
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:07,559
   Up next, Jaymes Mansfield.

562
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:08,493
        - Holy cow!

563
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,727
   - Hi, I'm Jaymes Mansfield.

564
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:12,229
    I'm a<i> tejano</i> living         
    in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

565
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:14,231
      land of beer, cheese      
       and serial killers.

566
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,899
            Shh.

567
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,400
        (all chuckle)

568
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:19,735
    - She's a dairy queen.

569
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:20,769
            - Aja.

570
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:22,871
    - Make America gay again.   
    - Yes.

571
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,440
    - My name is Aja            
    and I'm from New York,

572
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,608
where people are always angry   
       on the streets.

573
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,810
    But it's okay 'cause        
    you could be yourself.

574
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,344
        Lady Liberty has spoken.

575
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:35,414
- I wonder how many immigrants  
have gone through her.

576
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,549
        (all laugh)

577
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,584
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.

578
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,751
        She's got Georgia       
        on her mind.

579
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,486
         - And her face.

580
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:47,357
- I am Nina Bo'nina banana      
fo-nana Osama bin Laden Brown.

581
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,426
         Originally from        
         South Kakalaki,

582
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,594
      you can now catch me      
      in Atlanta, Georgia.

583
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,595
   Take a bite of this peach.

584
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,697
    - It looks like she's got   
    a touch of the Zika.

585
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,634
    - (laughs)                  
    - Oh, my, Michelle.

586
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,504
The last thing I thought would  
be brought up today is Zika.

587
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,406
        - Coming up...

588
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:08,342
    Our contestants             
    return to the stage

589
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:13,280
        wearing their very best 
                Lady Gaga drag.

590
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:15,015
    - Do I have something       
         on my face?

591
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:15,715
        (all laugh)

592
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:19,285
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

593
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,820
         (RuPaul laughs)

594
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:24,155
       - Welcome back           
    to the Miss Charisma,

595
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:26,157
        Uniqueness, Nerve       
        & Talent Pageant.

596
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,826
        (applause)

597
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:29,893
    In this next category,

598
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:33,162
    our contestants             
    return to the stage

599
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:39,034
        wearing their very best 
                Lady Gaga drag.

600
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:39,968
    First up, Peppermint.

601
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,637
       Grammy Awards 2016.

602
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:46,707
    - If it ain't brocade,      
         don't fix it.

603
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,642
         - Crowd control        
         to Major Tom,

604
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:51,978
      giving you Gaga/Bowie     
            realness.

605
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,879
             Because            
    the entire point of drag

606
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:56,948
    is to give the middle finger
         to rules of gender.

607
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,916
        - I have nothing to say.

608
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:01,451
   I'm going to be speechless   
        this whole time.

609
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,554
        - Wham, bam,            
        thank you, ma'am.

610
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:07,890
    Next up, Valentina,         
    the CFDA Awards.

611
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:11,126
    - That was Mugler when      
    Nicola Formicetti was there.

612
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:14,562
- I am wearing the look         
she wore for the CFDA Awards.

613
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:16,564
     I definitely see myself    
     a bit in Lady Gaga

614
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:19,600
   because she carries herself  
   with grace and glamour,

615
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,570
    but I always want to add    
    a Latina flair to what I do.

616
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:25,038
    - I brought my sister       
         as my date,

617
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,472
        and we were both        
        on the red carpet

618
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,674
   like a bunch of pissed off   
          New Yorkers.

619
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:31,643
   - Some things never change,  
darling.

620
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:32,810
    - Paparazzi love her.

621
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:38,515
    Next up, Eureka,            
    the "Telephone" video.

622
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:39,983
            - Yes.

623
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:41,651
      - Guilty as charged.

624
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,419
    I decided to do             
    the "Telephone" look.

625
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:45,788
    I just want to give them    
something big and glamorous

626
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,525
   and kind of risky couture.

627
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:50,659
   Got my titties on my chin,

628
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,861
    cinch, pull and tuck, honey,
that's the D.

629
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,829
        - Great choice, darling.

630
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,565
       I believe that was       
      Jean de Castelbajac.

631
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:58,532
    who made that garment.

632
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:00,567
    - Oh, you say that          
    to all the queens.

633
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:05,138
       - Next up, Charlie Hides,
               Brit Awards 2010.

634
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,973
   - That's a lace front wig,   
           I believe.

635
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:07,807
    - I believe it is.          
    - Yes.

636
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:09,675
      - I've chosen to wear     
           the outfit

637
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:13,111
    that Lady Gaga wore         
    for the 2010 Brit Awards.

638
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,980
    I've done Lady Gaga hundreds
        of times on YouTube,

639
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,716
and I think I'm pretty polished,
so I'm fairly confident.

640
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:21,785
        - Philip Treacy         
    made this for McQueen,

641
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:24,954
and he gave it to me because    
I was doing a tribute to him.

642
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,690
    - Don't be a drag,          
    be a McQueen.

643
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:32,861
     Next up, Farrah Moan,      
    the "Alejandro" video.

644
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:33,995
                - Pray and slay.

645
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:35,830
    - Oh, my God,               
    look at her cross.

646
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:39,900
      - I look exactly like     
            Lady Gaga

647
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:42,769
        in my "Alejandro"       
        music video look,

648
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:43,536
    and I'm rocking my real hair

649
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:48,641
     and I really hope that     
     Lady Gaga lives for it.

650
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:50,909
    - That attitude and the face
           is really good,

651
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,076
   and the makeup is on point

652
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,845
   because Steven Klein and I   
    had an argument about it.

653
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,413
I thought it was too much makeup
in this scene.

654
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,113
    - Don't cross this queen.

655
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,949
      - Everybody needs a virgin
             to sacrifice.

656
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,916
      - Can I get an amen?

657
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:05,787
    Next up, Sasha Velour,      
     the "Applause" video.

658
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,456
    - Do I have something       
         on my face?

659
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,023
        (all laugh)

660
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,891
        - I'm wearing           
        my favorite look

661
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:12,859
     that she has ever done.

662
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:17,730
   A Pierrot clown, high art,   
   Pat McGrath makeup.

663
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,666
                It is the place 
        where art and pop meet.

664
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:23,769
 - It's gonna be hard for this  
not to be one of my favorites.

665
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:25,403
     - What do you live for,    
              Gaga?

666
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,737
         - The applause.

667
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,204
        (all laugh)

668
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,105
     - Painted for the Gaga.

669
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:29,805
        (all laugh)

670
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:34,009
    - Alexis Michelle,          
    the Golden Globes.

671
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:36,945
    Best actress realness.

672
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,446
      - When I saw Gaga at      
 the Golden Globes in this gown,

673
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,616
     I said she's wearing       
     Alexis Michelle's body.

674
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:47,754
    So here I am body, curve,   
    swerve and trophies.

675
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:49,355
            - Yay!

676
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:51,724
    - Donatella Versace         
    made this for me.

677
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:54,793
       That is not easy to      
   make that bodice that way.

678
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:56,361
     Wonderful job, darling,

679
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:58,629
      and thank you for bringing
              my Globe with you.

680
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,030
        - It's Ver-sayce.

681
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,499
    - Matching trophy.

682
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:07,070
    - Shea Coulee,              
    Monster Ball Tour.

683
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:08,137
        Paws up, baby.

684
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:12,074
    - My Lady Gaga look,        
    it's ethereal, powerful,

685
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:14,076
    yet gentle and serene,

686
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,678
    and it mixes engineering    
          and fashion.

687
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,746
- This reminds me of the film   
that Nick Knight did

688
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:23,383
    with the yellow electric    
          urine blonde.

689
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:23,916
            - Mmm.

690
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:26,752
- Urine blonde is my screen name
on Scruff.

691
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:27,719
            - It is?            
            - Yes.

692
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:30,088
    - It's my password          
        on Netflix.

693
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,460
        - Trinity Taylor,       
 "American Horror Story, Hotel."

694
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:37,562
        - Yes, Countess.        
        - Yes.

695
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:39,497
        - This look speaks to me

696
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:43,567
    because I love darkness     
    and glamour and vampires.

697
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:46,937
            And Lady Gaga       
      was so seductive and sexy

698
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:48,805
   and brilliant in the show.

699
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:51,908
- Trinity, a little club soda   
will take that right out.

700
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,577
    - You know, they say that   
    if you use your own spit,

701
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,880
           the enzymes          
   break down the blood, so...

702
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:59,748
         - Good to know.        
         - Thank you.

703
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,950
    - This competition          
    is cutthroat.

704
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:06,821
         Kimora Blac,           
    Lady Gaga "On The Go."

705
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:08,189
    - This is the Versace phase.

706
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:11,592
- I'm giving a look that Gaga   
wears to, like, the airport.

707
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:15,596
   I think picking out what     
   she's done for red carpets

708
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:16,863
        is so predictable

709
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:18,731
    and it's so, like,          
    all right, done.

710
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,999
- Those boots, they remind me   
       of the pleasers

711
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,434
    that I used to get          
    off of, um...

712
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:24,835
    - Hollywood Boulevard,      
            honey.

713
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:25,569
        - Yep, yep.

714
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:26,770
       - No ifs, ands           
       or butts about it.

715
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:27,637
        - Uh-uh.                
        - No, ma'am.

716
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:31,841
    - Jaymes Mansfield,         
    the cover of "Vogue."

717
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:32,208
            - Oh.

718
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,444
     - I am serving you Gaga    
    on the cover of "Vogue."

719
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:37,012
        My drag is campy        
        and different,

720
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,981
     so I'm giving you Lady Gaga
          in slumber land.

721
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:40,848
         I look amazing.

722
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,815
    If they don't like          
    this dress,

723
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:44,651
    don't blame me,             
    blame Marc Jacobs.

724
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:45,752
    - Oh, she's a little sleepy.

725
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:48,688
       - It's Marc Jacobs.      
       She's Marco-leptic.

726
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,956
   - She's actually not wrong,  
either,

727
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,625
        because I was so tired  
the day that we did that shoot

728
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,694
that that's probably what       
I looked like in between shots.

729
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:59,830
      - Cover girl, put some gel
             in your hair.

730
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:05,702
    Nina Bo'nina Brown,         
        VMAs 2009.

731
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,136
        - Oh, my God.

732
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,769
      - Yes, McQueen, yes.

733
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,738
- This was one of the biggest   
nights of my life.

734
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,606
        - I'm serving you       
 the black version of Lady Gaga.

735
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:16,042
    Lot of hips, a lot of ass   
       and a lot of sass.

736
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,843
    I can't see how Lady Gaga   
           is reacting

737
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:19,644
    because I can't see anybody.

738
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:21,646
    - I just love the expression
             in her face

739
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:22,847
   when she wears this outfit.

740
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:24,114
    You know, you can tell      
         she's happy.

741
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:27,684
   - Oh, no, she's on the edge  
           of whore-y.

742
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:31,120
       Up next, Aja,            
    Commes des Garcons.

743
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,755
    - Now, where did I          
    park my car?

744
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:34,989
        - For my Lady Gaga look,

745
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,491
   I'm wearing a remake of her  
Commes des Garcons look

746
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:41,394
    that she wore to show       
    that beauty has no shape.

747
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:45,498
- Now, I wore this because      
the media was saying I was fat

748
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,666
   and I knew this archive,     
so I called Commes des Garcons

749
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,934
    and I asked him             
    if we could wear it.

750
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,069
          It's such             
    an excellent choice.

751
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:53,070
      - And very slimming.

752
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:54,871
   - It's all about the waist.

753
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:55,438
        <i> - Oy, gevalt.</i>

754
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,940
        (all laugh)

755
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,041
        - Coming up...

756
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:01,810
        Wait a minute.

757
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:03,545
     Stop the music, please.

758
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:09,817
     The real competition       
     is just about to begin.

759
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,554
        - Fuck. Oh!

760
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,556
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

761
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,192
         (RuPaul laughs)

762
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,929
       - Okay, judges,          
we are looking for one winner

763
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:25,697
    who has what it takes.

764
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:26,564
    Let's start with Peppermint.

765
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:28,198
    - I think Peppermint        
    has a fun personality.

766
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,302
You could tell that she likes   
to take the piss with her drag,

767
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,036
       and I do like that.

768
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,106
   I thought her Lady Liberty   
   was kind of basic to me.

769
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:38,107
    Peppermint's David Bowie,

770
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,908
   it would have been so great  
   to have the lightning bolt.

771
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,675
    - On the face, yeah.        
    - Yeah.

772
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,911
       - I love when I see      
      the exact impression

773
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:44,611
     and the detail in that,

774
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,112
       but the adding           
    of the hoop earrings,

775
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,847
     I didn't understand it.

776
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:49,148
       Bowie wouldn't have      
       worn them that big.

777
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,883
           If he did,           
      he would've worn one.

778
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:51,617
         - One, exactly.

779
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,285
           - You know,          
    so I'm looking at detail.

780
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,086
        - Valentina.

781
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,720
    - That hometown look of hers

782
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:59,589
    was my very favorite look   
    of anybody up there.

783
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:00,790
               It was just      
       such a strong look,

784
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,927
       and her Spanish sombrero,
               East L.A. homage,

785
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:06,662
   I thought it was super fun.

786
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:07,529
     I thought she was beautiful

787
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:08,496
          and I thought         
    the makeup was on point.

788
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,866
    And then, the Lady Gaga look
       was also super strong.

789
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,000
    - Both of these looks       
    brought a tear to my eye.

790
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:16,036
     Her walk was fantastic.

791
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:17,837
             For me,            
     she was the best model.

792
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,704
            - Mm-hmm.           
            - Wow.

793
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:19,604
    - Eureka, that first outfit,

794
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:24,241
    there was a little bit of   
    a used-up Tina Turner there.

795
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:24,874
       - Tina Turner away.

796
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:29,045
- I was laughing and entertained
and that's part of this.

797
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,913
        As far as her Gaga look,

798
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,781
    I thought it was fun,       
    it was detailed.

799
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:35,650
   - She's actually one of      
   my favorites of the night.

800
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:36,183
                - Charlie Hides.

801
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:38,084
        Her first look          
        was the pilgrim.

802
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,051
    - I wasn't blown away       
    by the first look.

803
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,786
      I felt like there was     
supposed to be a rip-away moment

804
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:44,990
     and it kind of just        
sort of got a little mangled.

805
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:47,792
    But the Gaga look might have
been one of my favorites.

806
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:51,095
    - The detail of the way that
that lace sort of interlays,

807
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:52,296
    it's beautifully done.

808
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:54,064
        - Farrah Moan.

809
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:56,866
   - That first outfit was      
definitely not Las Vegas.

810
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:59,001
     I felt it was more like    
     a different version

811
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:00,969
   of, like, "Anna Karenina,"   
            you know.

812
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:03,738
        - "Anna Karenina"       
   goes to "Game of Thrones."

813
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,905
        - Well, she does        
        sort of look like

814
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:07,707
   she's in the main showroom   
         of the Vatican.

815
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:08,274
        - Yes.                  
        - (laughs)

816
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:11,010
   - As far as her Gaga look,   
   being a smaller queen,

817
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,845
    she chose something         
    that swallowed her up,

818
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,280
and that might not have been    
the best idea for a Gaga look.

819
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:19,183
    - I was hoping that there   
   was going to be tear-away.

820
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:21,285
    - Yes.                      
    - And there wasn't.

821
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:26,156
      I do have to say          
I was impressed by her poise.

822
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:28,291
       - I'm wearing Poise      
      right now, actually.

823
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:29,825
        Sasha Velour.

824
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:33,595
     - One too many props       
     can spoil a good party.

825
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,330
    She was kind of cumbersomely
standing up there

826
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:36,331
    holding these things.

827
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,167
   - Hey, Michelle, it's only   
episode one of season nine,

828
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:41,035
    and I'm already             
    disagreeing with you.

829
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:41,668
             - Okay.            
             - Okay?

830
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,636
    - Go on.                    
    - I like more is more.

831
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,970
     I like that she brought    
           the props.

832
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,339
    She didn't waste any time   
showing us who she is.

833
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:48,073
        - Too much.

834
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,174
    - If you just lose          
    the portrait,

835
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:51,009
    this would've been          
    a perfect performance.

836
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:53,644
- Look at Gaga finding middle   
ground for Michelle and I.

837
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,946
     - And then, "Applause,"    
     I thought she did well

838
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:59,316
           and even in          
    that kind of flowy thing,

839
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:01,151
     it changed her persona.    
     - Yes.

840
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,185
    - Yeah, I didn't know       
         who it was.

841
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,720
    - Right.                    
    - And that is great drag.

842
00:34:04,722 --> 00:34:05,153
             - Yeah.

843
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:06,320
         - I don't think        
         any other queen

844
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:09,723
   told us exactly who she is   
   better than she did.

845
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:10,990
    - Alexis Michelle.

846
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:13,659
- When you're gonna use things  
like words on your body,

847
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:15,560
    you have to be able         
    to read them.

848
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:15,993
            - Mm-hmm.

849
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:18,095
   - And the way they were      
positioned on the bustier

850
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,996
     and on the corset,         
     you couldn't read them.

851
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:20,629
       The point was lost.

852
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:24,299
    But her Gaga moment         
    was stunning.

853
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:26,701
    - Yeah.                     
    - That dress is amazing.

854
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,002
      You could put Donald Trump
            in that dress,

855
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,670
    he's gonna look gorgeous.

856
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:32,272
    - No.                       
    - That I don't agree.

857
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:35,041
    The shape and the silhouette
that she achieved,

858
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:35,975
    this was really good.       
    - Mm-hmm.

859
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:38,911
   - This is someone to watch,  
            I think.

860
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:39,778
        - Shea Coulee.

861
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,613
    What'd you think about      
    that first outfit?

862
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,848
- I thought that was really fun 
and very memorable.

863
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,017
    I mean, who doesn't like    
    a giant wiener on your head?

864
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,284
   - As long at it's girth-y.

865
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,952
         - And I thought        
    the Gaga look was great.

866
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,854
        - That dress            
        is just amazing.

867
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:55,623
- The dress was actually made   
       by Jim Henson.

868
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,858
    - Of "The Muppets?"         
    - Yes. The original dress

869
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,895
was made in very particularly   
pleated origami,

870
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:03,096
    and it was mechanical.

871
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,131
                And I felt that 
        some of the other girls

872
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,699
    went a little further       
    with the detail.

873
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:11,637
    - Let's talk Trinity Taylor,
    no relation to Rip Taylor.

874
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,671
        - Oh, damn it!          
        - Yeah.

875
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:15,540
    - I thought Trinity's       
    Orlando outfit

876
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,774
        was kind of nondescript.

877
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:18,008
    You wouldn't know           
    where she was from.

878
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,812
    Now, when she turned around,
    it was the kind of anal sun.

879
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:23,245
             - Yeah.

880
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,179
   - And it was kind of like,   
            oh, okay.

881
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:28,116
      But her Countess Lady Gaga
             drag I loved.

882
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:28,850
        - Phenomenal.

883
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:30,818
       - I loved it             
    from top to bottom,

884
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,620
    and everybody knows         
    I love a bottom.

885
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:35,622
        - That hair that she did
                for the Countess

886
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,323
    is so difficult to do.

887
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:38,724
        To get that type        
        of smoothness

888
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:43,929
   and to get the lace to lay   
   that flat is very hard.

889
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,764
    She fucking nailed it.

890
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:47,332
         - Let's move on        
         to Kimora Blac.

891
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:51,002
- I thought the first look was  
not indicative of Vegas to me.

892
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:53,738
   It was very cheap looking.

893
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,605
    And the Gaga look, to me,

894
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,174
it just seemed like something   
you'd see in a bar.

895
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:58,775
       There's no pizzazz.

896
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:02,645
    - I think she needs a moment
         to get comfortable.

897
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,013
       - Jaymes Mansfield.

898
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:05,247
        - I love whimsy.        
        - Yeah?

899
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,615
- I thought I was being served  
        a comedy queen.

900
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:09,551
    I was left with a little    
    drag blue balls with her.

901
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:11,719
   I didn't get what I thought  
       I was going to get.

902
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,221
     - Well, there's so much    
         you could get.

903
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:15,188
    If you're from Milwaukee,

904
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,789
    I mean, you could be        
    covered in cheese.

905
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,158
    You could have a wig        
    that looks like an udder.

906
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,826
   Like, you can't go halfway.

907
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:22,694
    - Right. Like, take it      
    to the next level.

908
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:23,995
        - Milk it.              
        You milk it.

909
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:24,729
     - Milk it, honey, yeah.

910
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:28,733
    - What did you think        
    of her interpretation

911
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,101
    of your "Vogue" cover?

912
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:33,204
        - The hair              
    is not what it was.

913
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:35,706
         My bigger issue        
    is I think she's hiding.

914
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,742
     It's about her just letting
    her true self shine through.

915
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:41,811
    - All right. Let's talk     
    about Nina Bo'nina Brown.

916
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:42,378
    - I was so excited

917
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,846
    when she walked around      
          the corner.

918
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:46,148
     - It's whimsical,          
     but it's also fabulous.

919
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,850
    - That insane peach face    
         with the head.

920
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:53,955
        It's so twisted,        
   and yet it's so beautiful.

921
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,324
         And this choice        
         of the McQueen,

922
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:58,192
    she makes a statement       
    with each piece.

923
00:36:58,194 --> 00:36:59,860
            - She has           
     a point of view, yeah.

924
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:01,828
      - She has a point of view 
            as an artist.

925
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,728
        I see a star.

926
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,695
     - Let's move on to Aja.

927
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:07,265
      - I wasn't blown away     
by the Statue of Liberty moment.

928
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:07,898
        It's okay.

929
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,267
   - Why do you hate America,   
Carson?

930
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,901
        (all laugh)

931
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:16,105
            - I did love        
    the Commes des Garcons look,

932
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:16,939
    but the makeup was real bad.

933
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:18,674
         - I don't know         
   that she nailed it tonight,

934
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:22,678
         but this girl,         
she's gonna keep surprising you.

935
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,515
   - All right. Judges, time    
   to fill out your scorecards

936
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:30,185
        and bring back my girls.

937
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:31,719
    - The Florida               
    election committee

938
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:33,821
        will be verifying       
        these results.

939
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:34,888
        - (laughs)

940
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,590
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

941
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,993
         (RuPaul laughs)

942
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:42,927
         - Welcome back.

943
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,261
    I've combined               
    the judges' scores,

944
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:48,531
      divided them by five      
      and added a 20% tip.

945
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,932
        - (laughs)

946
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,369
    - When I call your name,    
    please step forward.

947
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:59,073
             Eureka.            
             - Ooh.

948
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:02,042
         - Sasha Velour.

949
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,813
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.

950
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:10,081
        - (gasps) Oh.

951
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:16,286
    - I wish you could see      
    the expression on your face.

952
00:38:16,288 --> 00:38:16,719
        - (laughs)

953
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:20,322
        - I wish I could see    
    the expression on your face.

954
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,556
   Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

955
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:27,093
             You are            
    our top three finalists.

956
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:29,028
    Now, if for any reason

957
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,863
        tonight's winner        
   cannot complete her reign,

958
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:36,201
the first and second runner-ups 
will thumb wrestle

959
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:39,337
              to determine      
      who takes her place.

960
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:40,338
        (all laugh)

961
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,006
        I hold in my hand

962
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:46,443
   the name of Miss Charisma,   
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent.

963
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:53,016
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
 of a fabulous week-long getaway

964
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:53,783
    to The Grand Resort and Spa,

965
00:38:53,785 --> 00:39:00,322
   Fort Lauderdale's premiere   
   gay men's spa resort...

966
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:00,789
            (inhales)

967
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:06,127
And the title of Miss Charisma, 
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent...

968
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:08,962
                The winner is...

969
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,164
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.

970
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,933
        - Yes!                  
        (applause)

971
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:14,867
                - Come on, mama.

972
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:19,037
     - For them to crown me,    
     it means a lot to me.

973
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,339
         Girl, Lady Gaga        
         bought my drag.

974
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,039
        She bought it.

975
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,441
    She didn't rent it          
     from the Netflix.

976
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,408
        She bought it.

977
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,143
      Validation complete.

978
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:29,345
    - Is there anything         
    you'd like to say?

979
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:30,412
          - I know that         
   this is just the beginning,

980
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:35,250
but to get you guys' approval   
for this means a lot to me.

981
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:36,251
        Thank y'all             
        so much for this.

982
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:37,151
    I truly appreciate it       
    from my heart.

983
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:41,321
- Well, my queen, go ahead      
and serve your public, honey.

984
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:43,189
    - Yeah. Come on, baby.

985
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,089
            - Yes.

986
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,791
   - Congratulations, darling.

987
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:48,859
    - Nina Bo'nina Brown.

988
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:51,294
    Oh, wait a minute.          
    Wait a minute.

989
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,496
     Stop the music, please.

990
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:57,132
    Ladies and gentlemen,       
    I have to apologize.

991
00:39:57,134 --> 00:40:01,202
   This is not a Steve Harvey   
moment.

992
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:03,804
       Nina, you are still      
               our winner.

993
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:06,873
      You are still our winner, 
            honey, but...

994
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:12,911
     The real competition       
     is just about to begin.

995
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:20,884
           I'm introducing      
     a 14th queen into the race.

996
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,886
            - (gasps)           
            - What?

997
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,088
            - Who?

998
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,857
        - Fuck. Oh!

999
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:30,426
        - Breathe.

1000
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,563
    - Please welcome back       
       to the race...

1001
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,031
       The 14th contestant

1002
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:42,903
        in the 9th season       
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

1003
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:50,510
            (screams)           
            - Yeah!

1004
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:51,244
                        - Bitch!

1005
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:54,247
     Ru, are you punking us?

1006
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:55,948
        - Oh, my God.

1007
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,482
        - No fucking way.

1008
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,150
            What?

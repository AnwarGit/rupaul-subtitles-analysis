but I got the biggest

[guffaws]

00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,967

boss here.

11
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,834

- Oh, my goodness.

14
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,400
- I don't know why they book me

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,900
on these chickenshit gigs.

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,033

understand we're looking for
the top.

21
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,967
Bring your "A" game.

22

- Oh.

46
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,867
- We're back in the workroom

47
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,467
this morning, and Kenya's not

48
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,533
here anymore, and it's sad,

49
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,300
'cause my best friend's gone.

00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,734

Sisters forever."

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,834
all: Aww.

53
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,367
- You sent both of
the Puerto Rican girls home.

54
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,800
- I know.

55

- You ain't never gonna be

[laughter]

57
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,433
Not even a touring production,
bitch.

58
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,834
- Oh, my gosh.
- Uh-uh.

59
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,533
- Bye, Kenya. I love you.

60
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,200
Uh! This hurts.

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,700
- Things got emotional
on the runway last week.

62
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,934
Today we've had a little time,

63
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:21,066
you know, to heal up, refocus.

64
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,700
I'm so, so happy that I won
the<i> Snatch Game.</i>

65
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,633
It was almost overshadowed by

66
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,266
how sad we were,
and it was hard

67
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,367
for me to celebrate, but I did
celebrate yesterday.

68
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,433
[laughter]

69
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,600
- I'll be honest.

70
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,367
I felt like my drag was
misunderstood.

71
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,633
Like, I'm so across the board.

72
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,700
I like to teeter-totter in the
boy world.

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,867
- I think teeter-tottering in

74
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,300
the boy world works when you're

75
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,100
super feminine.

76
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,200
It's hard for a drag queen to

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
teeter-totter in the boy world

78
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,734
while still being that drag.

79
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:50,867
- I have always had to deal

80
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,467
with people's perception of what

81
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,500
drag is, but I have to remain

82
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,700
true to myself.

83
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,934
I'm not gonna compromise.

84
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:58,967
- We know that you are
an accomplished actor.

85
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,834
Now, were those tears real,
Willam?

86
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:01,934
- Those were real, yeah.

87
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,700
I can cry on cue, but I wouldn't

88
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,133
have cried ugly like that.

89
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,133
- She was acting.

90
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,200
That was not real.

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,867
This bitch is faking it.

92
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,333
- My lashes were falling off.

93
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,266
- I didn't know Satan could
cry.

94
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,200
[alarm wails]

95
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,467

Here we go.

96

- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.

97
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,800
Greetings.

98
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,166
My name's RuPaul, and I'll be

Come aboard.

We're expecting you...

102
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,367
to make waves.

103
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,633
Okay?

104
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,800
Big waves.

105
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
Holla!

106
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,934
'Cause sometimes to avoid being

107
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:37,367
stonewalled, a girl's got to

108
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,333
rock the boat.

109
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,567
all: What?

110
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,400
- I don't get it.

111
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,667
- Hello, hello, hello.

112
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,133
[together]
Good morning, Ru.
Hello, Ru.

113
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,433
- Now, you all have been working

114
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,600
so hard that I've decided to

115
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,333
give you a break.

116
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,066
A spring break.

117
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,400
[cheers and applause]

118
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,133
- Tramp stamps.

119
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,867
- Today's mini challenge is

120
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,367
your chance to soak in the sun

121
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,900
and let it all hang out

122
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,734
in an all-American wet T-shirt
contest.

123
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,967

125
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,600
- Now, just outside is a thirsty

126
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,700
crowd of spring breakers.

127
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,967
Each of you needs to "wet" their

128
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,800
appetite, wearing a Glamazon

129
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,834

biggest reaction from the crowd

135
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,367
will win.

137
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,533
Jelly.

138
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,700
- This is money in the bank.

139
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,734
I got this.

140
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,567
- You have 30 minutes to style

141
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,700
and stuff your T-shirts.

142
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,166
I'll see you outside.

143
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,266
Let's go.

144
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:42,100
- Boobs!

145
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,266
- Holy moly.

146
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:48,066
- Show me your tits.

147
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,567
- Playing girlyish and bouncy

148
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,333
and sexy is something really

149
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,367
foreign to me.

150
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,734
- What and what and where is

151
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,934
the body, baby?

152
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,066
- My look is, "God, I want to

153
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,500
"go to Miami, but I can only

154
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,367
afford Fort Lauderdale."

155
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,834
- Mama Chad looks like a MILF.

156
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,800
Chad, damn.

157
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
It's called Forever 21,
not Forever 41.

158
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,200
- Let's go to the beach.

159
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,967
[cheers and applause]

160
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:19,934
[whistle blows]

161
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,834
- Welcome to spring break at

162
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,300
Dragtona Beach.

163
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,400
[cheers and applause]

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,333
Are you ready to get wet
and wild?

165
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,567
First up, from The Big Apple,

166
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,700
London, Paris...Milan.

167
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,700
She's got two big apples.

168
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,233
Oh.

169
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,200
She not shy.

170
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,233
She is mopping the floor.

171
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,700
Chad Michaels.

172
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,433
Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.

173
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,867
- My tits are big, my hair is

174
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,066
big, and my ass looks good.

175
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,200
I'm just feeling like
a drag cougar.

176
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,600
- It's Jiggly Caliente.

177
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,133
Her milkshake brings all the

178
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,867
boys to the yard.

179
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,900
Touch all of this, Jiggly.

180
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,533
Sharon Needles.

181
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,367
[laughs]

182
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,867
- I'm not one of those
fishy queens.

183
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,600
I never want to create a

184
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,133
character that someone would

185
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,834
want to fuck.

186
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,533
I like to mock sexiness.

187
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,200
[exclamations]

188
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,500
- She's a regular Danny Thomas

189
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,533
with that spit take.

190
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,066
Phi Phi O'Hara!

191
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,266
Uh-oh.

192
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,834
Oh, my goodness.

193
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,467
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

194
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,100
- I was shaking my boobs, and

195
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,400
all of a sudden my boobs
came off.

196
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,433
- She's coming undone.

197
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:50,767
- And then they poured
the water,

198
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,133
and then all of a sudden,
my wig fell off,

199
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,633
and it was a mess.

200
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,633
- Phi Phi, do you have all your
body parts?

201
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,233
[laughter]

202
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,867
Willam, Hollywood honey.

203
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,967
Oh, squirt. Squirt it.

204
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,700
I hope that lotion's
waterproof.

205
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,834
- I feel amazing,
because I know I look great.

206
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:12,300
And I was serving 'em sex,
and I just soaked it up.

207
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,166
- Oh, my God, she's driving

208
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,633
the crowd crazy.

209
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,500
She's a dirty, dirty girl,
that Willam.

210
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Everything tastes good on
a Dida Ritz.

211
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,767
She's soaking wet.

212
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,066
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

213
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,233
Chocolate milk.

214
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,433
Put your hands together for
Latrice Royale.

215
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,600
You need some cooling down,
girl.

216
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,567
Oh!

217
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,600
- You know my alter ego is
a stripper.

218
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,633
I'm loving every bit of it.

219
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,967
- Give it up for
Latrice Royale.

220
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:54,467
Thank you, Latrice.

221
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,333
You were all wet and wild.

222
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,867
Damn!

223
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,867
One of y'all really worked

224
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,900
the crowd into a lather.

225
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,066
Can I get a drumroll?

226
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,834
[drumroll]

227
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,100
The titular winner of today's

228
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,467
mini challenge is...

229
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:13,467
Willam.

230
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:16,133
- Yeah!

231
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,433
- Yes.

232
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,300
- I won; you know, it's kind of
a hobby of mine.

233
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,567
Thank you, God,
for all this bod.

234
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,800
- Condragulations, Willam.

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,834
Spring break 2012!

236
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,333
Now that spring break is over,

237
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,233
it's time for a little
herstory lesson.

238
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:37,967
Back in 1969, at the Stonewall
riots, it was a drag queen who

239
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,066
had the charisma, uniqueness,

240
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,333
nerve, and talent to dig her

241
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,667
heels in and start a revolution.

242
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,900
And every year since, drag

243
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,533
queens have been the shining

244
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,767
stars of pride celebrations

245
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,467
around the world.

246
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,066
For this week's main challenge,

247
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,100
you'll be styling

248
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,633
a fashion-forward look for our

249
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,867
very own pride parade.

250
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,567
Now, the theme for this year's

251
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,100
pride is hope floats.

252
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,133
In addition to your outfits,

253
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,734
you'll need to design parade

254
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:11,333
floats using these colorful
accessories.

255
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,200
[laughter]

256
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,367
Ships ahoy.

257
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,100
Each of you will be assigned

258
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,567
a different boat based on the

259
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,133
eight colors of the original

260
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,567
rainbow flag.

261
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,066
Willam, you won the mini

262
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,700
challenge, so you get to assign

263
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,066
the color themes,
using these hankies.

264
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,300
- I want blue.

265
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,533
Indigo blue.

266
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,166
I think this is the fairest way
to do it.

267
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,734
- Jiggly gets orange.

268
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,200
Phi Phi gets violet.

269
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Dida gets red.

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,867
Turquoise for Latrice.

271
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,967
Pink for Chad Michaels.

272
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,934
Yellow for Milan.

273
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,700
And green for Sharon needles.

274
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,467
Now, ladies, you can use your

275
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,700
own drag, plus materials

276
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,667
provided by Michael Levine
fabrics.

277
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,633
Your ensemble needs to be super

278
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,533
chic and take pride over the

279
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,400
rainbow and on to the runway.

280
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,934
Gentlemen, start your engines.

281
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,367
And may the best woman win.

282
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,567
- Yay.
- Oh, my God.

283
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,700
- Oh, look, shamrocks.

284
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
- This might buckle
my runway game.

285
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
- Your walk is your everything.
I don't know about that.

286
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
- Give it to me.

287
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,567
Give me Gautier
in a boat stripe.

288
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,633
- This is the ugliest color
ever.

289
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,800
- I love orange.

290
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
- It doesn't look good on me.

291
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,166
I went from baked potato to
sweet potato.

292
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,233
- Jiggly, what are you doing?

293
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,667
What is the concept of your
costume?

294
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:41,133
- As of right now,
I have no clue.

295
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,133
I'm not good at the creative
stuff.

296
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,066
This is the challenge where I
could sink to hell.

297
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,834
I want to incorporate this
somehow.

298
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:50,934
But then I just don't want it to
look like a Thanksgiving float.

299
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,667
And it's gonna look like
a turkey.

300
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,500
- Yeah, you don't want to look
like a turkey.

301
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't want that to happen.

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
- Fuck, I'm screwed.

303
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,734
- Today our main challenge is,

304
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:04,433
we have to create
a Pride Parade float

305
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:05,900
with a matching outfit

306
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,133
in one of the colors
from the Pride flag.

307
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,066
- Originally, for the old
gay rainbow flag,

308
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,266
green stood for nature.

309
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,700
There's nothing natural
about me.

310
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,800
- You made a snake.

311
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Are you doing a Garden of Eden
theme boat?

312
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,100
- Um, more like a Medusa.

313
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,500
Like, "Look at me, and I'll turn
you into Stonewall."

314
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,667
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,633
- So who here knows what
Stonewall is?

316
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,767
- Stonewall was in June of '69,

317
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,834
and the cops decided to go in
and cause some trouble.

318
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:32,834
- They were just, you know,

319
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,066
giving this one particular bar

320
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,133
all kinds of hell.

321
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,233
They just put their foot down.

322
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,734
They weren't gonna take it
anymore.

323
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,133
- I heard if you wore women's

324
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,867
clothing or makeup, they would

325
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,166
douse your head in the mop
buckets of nightclubs.

326
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,266
- Wow.

327
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,066
- You had to wear at least
three articles

328
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,166
of clothing that
were assigned to your genders

329
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,367
at all time,
or you could be arrested.

330
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,500
- I grew up in a religious

331
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,066
household, and that being gay

332
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,767
was just not something that
was accepted.

333
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,233
But this challenge does help me

334
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,567
rethink my perspective, because

335
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,867
it makes me very proud to know

336
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,900
that other queens have paved
the way.

337
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,767
- Chad, what was it like
to be there?

338
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,433
You were, what, 29 at the time?

339
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,967
[laughter]

340
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,700
- Okay.

341
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,400
I think for everybody to know
where we came from.

342
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,300
A legacy of drag deserves
to be carried on.

343
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,467
Me and Bob used to just
sit around for hours

344
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,500
and just glue sequins
onto dresses.

345
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,834
Bob's no stranger to a glue gun
in a pinch.

346
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,133
- That whole impersonating thing

347
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,867
you have to really do
your homework

348
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,633
to get every nuance,
ever characteristic.

349
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,767
- You do.

350
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,767
Celebrity impersonation
is my passion.

351
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,200
And it has been
from the beginning,

352
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,266
because when I started
in my show, the<i> Dreamgirls,</i>

353
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,300
it was all look-alikes
and all comedy,

354
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,867
and if you wanted to be
in the show,

355
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,533
you had to do
celebrity impersonations.

356
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,734
- Wow.

357
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:48,100
- I'm absolutely here
to be a role model.

358
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,500
This art doesn't have to die,
because it is dying.

359
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,066
There aren't very many people
like me anymore who do,

360
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,700
like, actual
"celebrity impersonation."

361
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,734
That's what I've done
for most of my career

362
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:03,433
is be a celebrity impersonator,
and I've loved it.

363
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,266
rock it out.

364
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,333
I've been, you know,
in the business a while.

365
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,734
I want to inspire the younger
generation of drag queens

366
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:14,367
to step up and do it right.

367
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,200
- [blowing]

368
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,300
[spits]

369
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,700
Fucking swallowed glitter.

370
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,367
- You've swallowed worse.

371
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,600
We're gonna have dinner soon.

372
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,734
Stop eating the glitter.

373
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,367
- Stupid-ass bitch.

374
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,333
- Goddamn it, Jiggly.

375
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,900
- Fuck you.

376
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,633
- Oh, my God.
I love my boat already.

377
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,567
I want to go on my boat so bad.

378
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,900
- You fucking cunt.

379
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,300
- [laughs]

380
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,433
I decide to do all-over pattern

381
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,767
of stars, or stickers, that have

382
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,066
my face on them.

383
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,333
The theme is hope floats, and

384
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,700
I've always hoped to be a star.

385
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,734
- That's you?

386
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:52,734
- Yes, it's me.

387
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,100
- You dirty bitch.

388
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,900
- Narcissistic much?

389
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:01,300
- Willam's boat was covered
in stickers of himself

390
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,200
and to me did not represent
Pride at all.

391
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,367
- How are you feeling
about this challenge?

392
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,967
- This is not something
that I normally do,

393
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,567
and I'm really--I'm trying
to focus on the boat first

394
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,600
and make sure I get
something down for that.

395
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,900
Trying to do what I can.

396
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Sink or swim.
Sink or swim.

397
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,066
The most difficult thing
about the challenge for me is,

398
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,500
my brain goes in 20 million
different directions.

399
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,767
Sometimes being an artist
can be difficult.

400
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:28,433
- Here's your micro-dot, babe.

401
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,200
- Oh, shit.
I didn't realize that.

402
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,533
The clock was ticking,
and all I could think about was,

403
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:38,800
"Try to convey some type
of message on this float."

404
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
- Hello, hello, hello.

405
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,066
all: Hi, Ru.

406
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,767
- It looks like
a Kylie Minogue concert

407
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,133
exploded in here.

408
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,700
- [chuckles]

409
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,533
- Jiggly Caliente.

410
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,300
- Hello.
- May I call you Jiggly?

411
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,433
- Yes, you may.
- Oh, good.

412
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,567
What we're looking for is
fashion-forward.

413
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,734
You know,
the theme is hope floats.

414
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:59,300
What statement are you going
to make?

415
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,433
- I--the statement I want to

416
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,934
make is that, um...

417
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,867
dreams are possible.

418
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,100
- Huh.

419
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,467
Now, what are your plans to
decorate your boat?

420
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,233
- Um, I plan on adding the

421
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,800
trimmings, the fabrics, and then

422
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,133
I'm gonna add the flowers and

423
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,266
other knickknacks.

424
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,800
- Yeah.

425
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,667
- Ru is not buying my bullshit
at this.

426
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,633
I know it.
I can see it in her eyes.

427
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,066
- I don't want to worry you,

428
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,133
but you do seem a little bit
behind.

429
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,934
We're looking for an expression
of Jiggly.

430
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,066
- Definitely.
- All right.

431
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,367
Get back to work.

432
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,066
- Thank you.

433
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,967
- How am I gonna do this?

434
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,233
- Dida Ritz.

435
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,333
- Hi, Ru.

436
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,567
- So what are you gonna do?

437
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,333
- I'm going for a '70s
really hippie vibe.

438
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,066
Very love, peace, and harmony.

439
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,200
And my whole concept
is a jumpsuit.

440
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,066
- With a blouse.

441
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,734
- Maybe with a blouse,
maybe not.

442
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,166
I don't know yet.

443
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:59,233
- We're looking to see the best
Dida that there is.

444
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,066
We want fashion-forward,
you know?

445
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,066
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,767
- I'll see you out
on the parade route.

447
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,467
- Thank you, Ru.
- Good luck.

448
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,667
Hi, Chad.

449
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,066
- It's time for another edition
of Ru's Clues.

450
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,400
- [laughs]

451
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,967
What are you gonna do
to make sure that your boat

452
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:17,133
and your costume and everything
represents hope

453
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,767
and the future of gay pride?

454
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,100
- I really want it to be,
you know, cyber showgirl,

455
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,066
fashion-forward.

456
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,567
- Now, you're boat.
- My boat.

457
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,066
- You've got a lot
going on there.

458
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,300
You have netting around there.

459
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,433
- I have netting.

460
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,834
I'm capturing hearts and minds
with my net.

461
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:36,233
- Are you planning to edit
the boat at all?

462
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:40,066
- I feel like it's got
a really futuristic feel to it

463
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,200
with, you know--

464
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
- The metallic.

465
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,333
- The metallic and the square,
like,

466
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,567
faux sequin and all that.

467
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,100
- I can't wait to see it
on the runway.

468
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,233
- I'll be there.

469
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,233
- All right, Chad.

470
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,400
You get back to work,
Lady Chad-erly.

471
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,066
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

472
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,066
- Well, well, well, Willam.

473
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:56,633
- It's starship Willam.

474
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,633
- Wow.

475
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,967
- In your book you had a quote

476
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,834
that said,
"Even when I was down,

477
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,200
"I treated myself as
a star.

478
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,367
And eventually, the rest of
the world would catch up."

479
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:06,400
And I wrote that on my little
binder in eighth grade.

480
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,900
I've adopted that theory too.

481
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,133
I've always treated myself like

482
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,500
a star and just knew it was

483
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,066
gonna happen.

484
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,300
- We got on your case last week

485
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,834
about being more vulnerable, and

486
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,066
that story's very vulnerable.

487
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,967
And what do you plan on wearing
if anything?

488
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,900
- Do you remember that episode
of<i> Sex and the City</i>

489
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,400
where Carrie
fell down on the runway?

490
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,467
- Yes.
- Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat.

491
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,133
Oh, well, look who's got it.

492
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,367
- Is that the exact one?

493
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,734
- It's not the one she wore.
- I see.

494
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,233
- Because, you know, she's so
much bigger than me.

495
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,367
- [laughs]

496
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,066
I'm gonna let you get back
to work here.

497
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,066
Bye.

498
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,700
London, Paris, Milan.

499
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,734
- Hi, Ru.

500
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,500
- So tell me about this boat.

501
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,767
- My inspiration for this,

502
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,533
honestly, I mean, we're doing a

503
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,600
future thing, but I wanted to

504
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,533
try to do a flashback
to the future.

505
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,066
- A flashback to the future.
- Yes.

506
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,800
- But we're asking you to be
fashion-forward.

507
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,233
Now, you live in New York city,
the most fashionable city...

508
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,200
- I do.

509
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,300
- In the U.S.

510
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,734
Where do your costumes
come from?

511
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:58,934
- Um, usually I have people
make them for me.

512
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,133
- I see.

513
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,567
- 'Cause a lot of my costumes
are characters,

514
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,767
like the housewife or that looks
like the lady next-door.

515
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:06,900
- You don't want the audience

516
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,467
to know who you are.

517
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,333
You want them to see
a character.

518
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,600
But we want to know who you are.

519
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,667
- No, I definitely want them to
know who I am.

520
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,500
- Because you have lip-synched
twice.

521
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,867
- I have.

522
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,500
- Make that Milan come out.

523
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,066
- Okay.
- Get back to work.

524
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,734
- Thank you.
- All right.

525
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,633
Phi Phi O'Hara.

526
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,100
- Hi, Ru.
- How are ya?

527
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,333
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

528
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,500
So what are you working on?

529
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,066
- I have a one-armed catsuit
right now.

530
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,567
- Is that Uranus on...

531
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,667
- It is my-ranus.

532
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,133
- Okay.
- Yeah.

533
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,066
- The theme is hope floats.

534
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,734
I want to know about your

535
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,600
darkest hour and how you were

536
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,333
able to get over that.

537
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,066
- Well, as a kid, I had--I grew

538
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:49,200
up in a really abusive, like,
household.

539
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,867
And it wasn't a very good
childhood.

540
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,734
And it took 16 years for us to

541
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,500
figure it out, but we did.

542
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,567
<i>It feels good to leave all that</i>
<i>stuff back there.</i>

543
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,934
<i>Chicago's a fresh start for me.</i>

544
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,800
<i>I get to live the life that</i>
<i>I want to live.</i>

545
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,834
- So you've come a long way,
baby.

546
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,333
You've pulled yourself up out

547
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,934
of some really dark places.

548
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,600
This is your chance to shine.

549
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,333
I'm counting on you to pull
through.

550
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,233
- Okay.
- Okay, you've done it before.

551
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,367
You can do it again.

552
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,233
- I will.
- All right. Get to work.

553
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,567
- Yes.
- All right.

554
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,433
At ease.

555
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:25,066
- All right, ladies,
gather round.

556
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,967
Tomorrow on the main stage,

557
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,800
we'll be celebrating Pride with

558
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,500
our extra-special guest judges,

559
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,567
fashionista and TV star, my good

560
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,200
pal Kelly Osbourne will be here.

561
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,300
- Oh, my God.
Yay.

562
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,567
[cheers and applause]

563
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,700
- I love Kelly Osbourne.

564
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,633
Even to even get read by her,
I don't care.

565
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,734
It's an honor.

566
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:44,867
She's sickening.

567
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,066
- And a woman who's no stranger
to the navy.

568
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,700
From<i> NCIS,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Pauley Perrette</i>
will be here.

569
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,333
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

570
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,333
[applause]

571
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,567
- Wow.

572
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,967
- How many times did you work
with her, Willam?

573
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,066
- Just once, so fuck off.

574
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,934
[laughter]

575
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,600
- Now, ladies, remember...it

576
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
ain't the size of your boat but

577
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,767
the motion in your ocean, okay?

578
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,800
- Okay.
- Good luck.

579
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,734
And don't fuck it up.

580
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,033
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. All right.

581
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,266
- See you later.
- Thanks, Ru.

582
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:15,867
- Bye.

583
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,834
- Arts and crafts day.

584
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,333
- Our challenge today is to make
fabulous fashion-forward

585
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,367
outfits and gay pride floats.

586
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,433
So with challenge,
you have to have a crafty eye,

587
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,800
and you have to be creative with
your float and your costume.

588
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,467
This competition
is really gonna show

589
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,767
who can keep up
with the big girls.

590
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,033
Fucking shit.

591
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,667
Fuck.

592
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,400
- I did it all wrong.

593
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,467
Fuck.

594
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:46,066
- Oh, my God.
Now I just fucked it up.

595
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,600
- But that's pretty.

596
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Girl, you're gonna win.

597
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,900
- You can kiss my ass.

598
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,967
- [laughs]

599
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,633
- Ugh.

600
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,633
It is very hard to create an

601
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,900
outfit from scratch in a day and

602
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,934
decorate a boat.

603
00:20:57,934 --> 00:20:59,767
It's damn near impossible.

604
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,066
My God, this making a boat crap

605
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:06,266
is just--is not the type of
dress...

606
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,400
all righty.

607
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
- You okay?
- No.

608
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,066
- She doesn't know her idea
for her boat.

609
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,533
- You have a bunch of stuff over
there,

610
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,934
and you have a lot
of good stuff too.

611
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,533
Open stuff up.
Look at the textures.

612
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,700
Look at all that stuff
and just play with it.

613
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,233
Jiggly's just out of her element

614
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,266
being on this competition.

615
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,133
She is so far behind, and it's

616
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,200
just like, "Girl, just get your

617
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,133
crap done."

618
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,300
- The hardest part about this

619
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,367
challenge is not telling

620
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:32,133
everybody else that I'm gonna
win.

621
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,734
- Wow, that is really cool.

622
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,533
- Yeah, I mean, it looks
egotistical,

623
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,266
but it's got a message,

624
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,667
like, "I'm gonna handle myself

625
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,767
like I'm gonna be
somebody someday."

626
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,433
- You're sickening, bitch.
You're sickening.

627
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,567
- Sickening?

628
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,400
More like absolutely disgusting.

629
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,700
- Really?
- Yeah, bitch.

630
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,433
- Thank you.

631
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,700
- So has anybody ever done,

632
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,433
like, pride performances or
pride shows?

633
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,367
- Bitch, I put my gay pride
time in, honey.

634
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,133
In my years.

635
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,700
- In Pittsburgh, they don't

636
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,667
ask me ever to do Pride.

637
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,934
I mean, maybe they just think

638
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:03,467
my act is reserved
for nighttime only.

639
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:05,266
- Maybe it's because she's
a spooky bitch.

640
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:08,500
- I like spotlights,
not sunlight.

641
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,200
- What was it like for you guys
in your hometowns

642
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,166
growing up being gay?

643
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,367
- I'm from Texas, so Texas is

644
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,133
not about the whole
being gay thing.

645
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,567
I remember, when I first went

646
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,400
out to the gay clubs, there was

647
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,834
a lot of, like, gay bashing,

648
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,066
and, like, guys would come by

649
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,133
with, like, baseball bats.

650
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,967
Like, moving to Chicago, I can

651
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:26,500
hold someone's hand walking down

652
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,166
the street or I can be
affectionate.

653
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,400
And In Texas, you can't do that.

654
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,467
- Damn.

655
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,133
- It's kind of hard
for me to talk about it.

656
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:35,533
I don't really like
where I come from.

657
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't--it is not
a lot of good memories.

658
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,133
I was teased a lot
when I was young.

659
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,967
I hate talking about it,
'cause it makes me just pissed.

660
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,834
Like, the people that called me
a fat girl,

661
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,367
some of them still work--
no shade--

662
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,333
but still work at McDonald's,
still work at Burger King,

663
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,433
still living at home
with their parents,

664
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,600
ain't got a life.

665
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,767
Home is not a good memory
for me.

666
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,800
- Theresa,
I knew you grew up in Compton.

667
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,633
- Ugh.
- What was that like?

668
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:57,200
- You don't even think about
saying the world "gay"

669
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,333
or that you're gay.

670
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,633
It's straight-up hood there.

671
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,767
You know what I mean?

672
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,133
So I was threatened
and beat up and told

673
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,867
if I was ever--turned out gay,

674
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:08,333
I would get killed,
and it was rough.

675
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,133
So I just kept all that
to myself

676
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,600
until I was big enough
and bold enough

677
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,767
and grown enough to move.

678
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,834
And so I did, you know,
and...

679
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,567
- Is the New York drag
community all in Manhattan?

680
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,800
- The New York drag community
is sort of everywhere.

681
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,967
Definitely certain areas where

682
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,533
there's certain drags
you can see.

683
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,900
There's the singing girls,

684
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,266
there's the campy girls, there's
the grunge girls...

685
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,367
- So what are you?

686
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,500
Like, what's your...

687
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,600
- I'm a floater.

688
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,533
My style kind of bounces around.

689
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:37,367
<i>I don't want to be pigeonholed</i>
<i>as just a drag "queen."</i>

690
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,834
I think it's important for
people to see that there is

691
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,066
an artist on stage.

692
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,967
- I have dignity looks and
paycheck looks.

693
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,567
Dignity is when I will not bend

694
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,433
for anyone, and I don't care if
I make a dollar.

695
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,633
I'm doing what I'm doing.

696
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:52,967
- Right.

697
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,166
- And there's times the
electric's about to shut off,

698
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,300
so I dress up like Lady Gaga.

699
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,266
- Right.

700
00:23:56,266 --> 00:24:00,667
[laughter]

701
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,066
- Jiggly, is that a men's shirt
or a women's shirt?

702
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,734
Your hanger strap is showing,
and I already know the answer.

703
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,066
- No, it's not.

704
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,633
- You cross-dresser!

705
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,834
We're supposed to be boys today,

706
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,533
and you're cross-dressing.

707
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,066
- Really, girl? Really?

708
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:14,867
Her slick-ass comments are gonna
drive me crazy.

709
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,200
- ♪ Watching my boat ♪

710
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
- Shut up.

711
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
- You shut up.

712
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,734
- Ugly bitch.

713
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:23,400
- You shut your ugly boat
mouth.

714
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,233
- Oh, you have something to
say, bitch?

715
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,066
- Yeah, your boat's ugly.
- You narcissistic whore.

716
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,266
- Your boat's ugly.

717
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,734
- I don't care.
My boat could be ugly, bitch.

718
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,567
- But your face is ugly.
- Your boat don't float.

719
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,100
Your boat don't float.

720
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,867
- Come here and say that,
bitch, 'cause I will inject this

721
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,133
shit right in your cheeks,
ho.

722
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,300
- Ohh, don't talk to me like
Chad Michaels.

723
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,066
You know how passionate he is
about silicone work.

724
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:43,667
- [as Cher]
Shut up, stupid.

725
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,100
Willam runs his mouth a lot.

726
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,066
It's kind of like a spigot you
can't turn off.

727
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,734
And it started to get on my
nerves.

728
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,567
I'm Cher, bitch.

729
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:53,066
- You guys, you know what my
boat reminds me of?

730
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,900
- What?
- A winner.

731
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,233
[laughter]

732
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:59,300

[alarm goes off]

739
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,934
- Anchors aweigh, bitches.

740
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:26,066
- Cluck-cluck, ladies.
- So much to do.

741
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,367
- Let's get to work.

742
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,667
- I was having panic attacks
about this damn snake.

743
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,800
- The mood in the workroom
right now is intense.

744
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,066
Queens are hustling,
people gluing, going crazy.

745
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,800
It's insane right now
in the workroom.

746
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,767
- Does this look like a fucking
anchor yet?

747
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,433
I ended up with the final

748
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,867
concept for my boat last minute.

749
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,800
Now I just got to finish it.

750
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,867
Sharon?

751
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,700
- Yeah?
- Does this look like an anchor?

752
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,867
- It kind of looks like
a dick.

753
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:56,367
- It does look like a penis.

754
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,667
- What's the theme of your
boat?

755
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,367
- The whole, "It gets better,
love you for you,"

756
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,066
very Saint-Tropez.

757
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:03,700
Bright colors.

758
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,467
Very Saint-Tropez.

759
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,266
So I'm just, like,
scrambling for time.

760
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,900
- Jiggly's is still a mess.

761
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,233
She kept adding crap upon crap

762
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:13,834
on top of more crap, so it just

763
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,066
looked like a big pile of crap.

764
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:19,567
- I'm just gonna try to go for

765
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,900
obvious things--sunlight,

766
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,500
yellow, you know, happiness.

767
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
- Right.

768
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,066
- I'm gonna get a little grade
school at moments.

769
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,500
- There ain't gonna be nothing
about grade school on my boat.

770
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,800
My boat's gonna be an all-adult
function.

771
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
- If I would have made Milan's

772
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,100
boat, I wouldn't have put<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on it.</i>

773
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,667
I would have blamed it on
someone else.

774
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:37,934
Like, "I didn't do this boat.

775
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,266
No, this is her boat.

776
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,633
That girl's boat, not my boat."

777
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,133
- I'm looking around the room,

778
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,633
and I'm in drag, everybody else

779
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,233
is practically done and in drag,

780
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,800
and Jiggly's still stapling and

781
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,066
gluing stuff to her float, and

782
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm like, "Hello, you only have,

783
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,867
"like, minutes left until you've

784
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,367
got to be in drag and on that
runway."

785
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,734
- It's sink or swim.

786
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,400
You better be ready,
and you better care.

787
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,300
- Jiggly is a hot mess.

788
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,533
Good luck, girl.

789
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,166
- Oh, shit.

790
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,600
Where the fuck are my tits?

791
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,633
- Welcome to the main stage of

792
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:37,834
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

793
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:38,967
Hey, guys.

794
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,533
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.

795
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,967
- Michelle Visage, are you

796
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,333
proud of our girls?

797
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,166
- I am proud to be an American,

798
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,867
and I am proud of our girls.

799
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,400
- [laughs]

800
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,700
Billy B., are you ready to see
our girls?

801
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,266
- I am so ready.

802
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,266
- Kelly Osbourne.

803
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,433
- Hi, Ru.

804
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,066
- You've been grand marshal

805
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,367
of Gay Pride here in

806
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:00,433
Los Angeles.

807
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,667
- Yes, with my mama.

808
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,500
- Well, you'll feel right at
home here.

809
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,233
- I already do.

810
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:07,633
- Pauley Perrette,
welcome aboard.

811
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,333
- Thank you.
Happy to be here.

812
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,734
- I love a parade.

813
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:11,767
Don't you?

814
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,867
- Yes.

815
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,166
- This week our queens were

816
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,266
challenged to design Pride
floats.

817
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,934
Now they're ready to parade

818
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,800
them down the runway.

819
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,200
Are you ready to see their true
colors?

820
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,567
- Hell, yeah.

821
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,333
- Gentlemen, start your

822
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,066
engines,
and may the best woman win.

828

showgirl--always beautiful,

830
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,800
always painted, nearly naked.

831

833
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,200
- Snapper.

834
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,967
- Dida Ritz in red.

835
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,266
Oh, I love a harem pant.

836
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,800
- I'm serving float
coutureness.

837
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,967
I'm not letting this boat get
in my way.

838
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,233
I always leave my mark.

839
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,533
Honey, I pee on the runway.

00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,633
Trust.

841
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:11,567
- Red sky at night,
sailors' delight.

842
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,934
Nice aft.

843
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:16,834
Up next, Jiggly Caliente in my

844
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,934
favorite color, orange.

845
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,533
- Tangerine dream.

00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:22,500
- Yes.
- I look good.

847
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,667
My wrap is flowing.

848
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,834
My hair's flowing.

849
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:25,900
My makeup is right.

850
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,934
My lips look right.

851
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,767
I look sickening, bitch.

852
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,367
- Mm, it reminds me of
Orange Julius.

853
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,066
Or is it Lrange Jiggly-us.

854
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,300
Milan.

855
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,166
- Hello, sunshine.

856
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,066
- I'm feeling proud of what
I created.

857
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,133
My float is<i> The Milan Invasion.</i>

858
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,200
It's inspired by Fire Island.

859
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,500
- Boatload of wigs.

860
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,066
- It's nice to have extra wigs,
though.

861
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,533
- It is, 'cause, if you end up

862
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,734
on<i> Gilligan's Island</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and you</i>

- Hello.
- Yeah.

865
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:55,667
- Ooh, Sharon Needles.

866
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,066
- She is from the
Garden of Eden.

867
00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:00,367
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?

868
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,266
- I was really serving them
some snake realness.

869
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,100
I can strike at any time.

870
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,934
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

871
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,467
I love!

872
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:14,233
- Latrice Royale in turquoise.

873
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,166
- The goddess of the sea.

874
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,400
- Wow.
Look at all that water.

875
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,133
- I just want it all to hang
out today.

876
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,900
I have this hair that I baked

877
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,133
and sculpted and hand-painted.

878
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,667
- Love those lips.

879
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,333
- She fell face-first at
Claire's.

880
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,533
- [laughs]

881
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:33,467
- Now that is a Poseidon
adventure.

882
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,467
- Willam.

883
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,066
Oh, dear.

884
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,800
She's a low rider.

885
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,467
- Check that out.

886
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,000
- Dropping anchor.

887
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
Land ho.

888
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,033
- Oh, my God.

889
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,934
Permission to come aboard.

890
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,467
- Ooh, girl, I'm dusted.

891
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,800
- My costume's right,
my body's right.

892
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,433
This challenge is right up my
lagoon.

893
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,633
- She's showing us her
starboard side.

894
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,934
Stick it in the porthole,
Willam.

895
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,900
- Phi Phi O'Hara.

896
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,600
- Like a float warrior.

897
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,567
- Ooh, love is a battleship.

898
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,166
- My look I'm channeling is

899
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,533
fashion-forward sci-fi.

900
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,567
I'm trying to give them
a bad-ass bitch.

901
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,066
- It's the Phi-Phi-tanic.

902
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,166
- She's going down with
the ship.

903
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,333
- Love it.

904
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:19,467
- Purple for passion.

905
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,233
My colorful queens,

906
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,500
I love a parade.

907
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,734
But now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

908
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:28,767
First up, Chad Michaels.

909
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,600
And what does your float say
about you?

910
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
- Obviously, with the stripes
on my costume

911
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,934
and the stripes on my boat,
I'm a drag cougar.

912
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,233
- [laughs]

913
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,266
- Rrargh.

914
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:38,433
I basically wanted to go with

915
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,667
classic showgirl,
but fashion-forward.

916
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,900
- Can you turn around so I can
see your butt, please?

917
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,767
That's my favorite part of your
whole costume.

918
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:45,767
I love it.

919
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,934
- Thank you.

920
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:48,867
- To me, it is traditionally
showgirl.

921
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,734
There's not something so fresh

922
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,567
and modern about it.

923
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,433
- Next up, Dida Ritz.

924
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,800
Wow, and your hair is all big
and everything.

925
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,967
- Take a little bit of advice
and put it to use.

926
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,500
- You have the cutest face.

927
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,800
So adorable.

928
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,433
- You do have a pretty face.

929
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:06,633
Sometimes I think that you might
rely on it too much.

930
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,934
What you have on,
it's not particularly an event.

931
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:14,066
You always seem sort of
pedestrian.

932
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,066
- Your boat, it looks a little
bit piñata-like.

933
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,400
You know, you want more.
It is a parade.

934
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,667
- Jiggly Caliente.

935
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,400
Tell us about your float.

936
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,867
- Right now, there's a lot of

937
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,467
gay youth being bulled.

938
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,300
I decided to use "Love you for
you."

939
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,233
I wanted to class it up a bit,

940
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:33,533
make it very Saint-Tropez.

941
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:37,667
'cause my outfit is really
a swimsuit.

942
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,567
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yeah.

943
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,133
- Very Saint-Tropez.

944
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,834
- I'm really happy you took
your cape off.

945
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,166
I was dying to see what was

946
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,166
underneath there,
and it's adorable.

947
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,567
- It's the big reveal.

948
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,700
- You should have walked
the runway without the cape.

949
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,767
The boat, you said you wanted to

950
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,233
give it some class.

951
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,300
It's, like, sixth-grade class.

952
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
- Ugh.

953
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,600
- Next up, London, Paris,
Milan.

954
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,633
- Basically I wanted to
represent the history

955
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,367
of the
drag performance invasion on

956
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,133
Fire Island with the girls who

957
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:06,934
have long passed who have paved

958
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,433
the way for me to go forward in
the future.

959
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,300
And I named it<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion,</i>

960
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,767
because it's me,
and I'm invading the world.

961
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,300
- I know all about Fire Island.

962
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,233
The thing is, the boat didn't
really read that.

963
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,433
It was hard to understand.

964
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,734
- You know, everyone else sort

965
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,300
of had a real message about

966
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,967
pride, and the biggest thing

967
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,867
about your boat is that you made

968
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,133
it about you.

969
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,633
It sort of offended me.

970
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,133
- Sharon Needles.

971
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,934
You've got a little snake story
line going on there, don't you?

972
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:37,200
- The original green color in

973
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,266
the rainbow flag stood for
nature.

974
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,400
- Yeah.

975
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,934
- 'Cause all gays were hippies
in the '70s.

976
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,367
[laughter]

977
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,667
I used the snake because they're

978
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,633
feared for the wrong reasons.

979
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:48,934
And I've always been feared for

980
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:49,967
the wrong reasons.

981
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,767
- I'm so into your hand snake.

982
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,900
- My hand works great on
a snake.

983
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,367
- I think you look beautiful.

984
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,266
Your boat on the other hand

985
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,166
looks like it sank a few years

986
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,200
ago and it's covered in moss.

987
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,367
It sort of lost boat to me.

988
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:07,567
It just became this big green
thing.

989
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,066
- All right, next up,
Latrice Royale.

990
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,800
Lady turqu-ahh.

991
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,200
- I love anything that

992
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,734
sparkles, and you sparkle from

993
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:16,934
head to toe, and I love it.

994
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,200
- My lips are gonna crack.

995
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,967
- Tonight you're giving us
Nefertiti meets Ursula

996
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,066
the sea witch.

997
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,233
- Yes!

998
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,667
- I'm gonna challenge you on
one thing, Latrice.

999
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,767
- Tell me.
- The boots.

1000
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:25,867
- [sighs]

1001
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,400
- Girl, we seen 'em quite a bit
now.

1002
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,633
- Are you saying those boots
weren't made for boating?

1003
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:31,066
[laughter]

1004
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,500
- You really are an event.

1005
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,200
It's a beautiful, simple boat,

1006
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
and it has a chicness that you

1007
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,700
always seem to have.

1008
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
It's a good job.

1009
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,066
- Thank you.

1010
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:44,433
- Next up, Willam.

1011
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:45,633
- I'm giving you maritime

1012
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,100
realness with the starship
Willam.

1013
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,133
[laughter]

1014
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,967
Amenities include Wi-Fi.

1015
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,500
There's a party deck and
a business center.

1016
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,667
[laughter]

1017
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,667
- Why is Pride important?

1018
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,266
- I got married in California

1019
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,100
when it was legal, and then now,

1020
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,667
all of a sudden, it's not.

1021
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,734
Prop 8 got my ass down hard.

1022
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,133
So I love that I got to do

1023
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,967
a Pride challenge, and this is
Dolce &amp; Gabbana, so I love it.

1024
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,300
- So the coat is Dolce, and

1025
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,934
the swimsuit is Gaultier.

1026
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:15,066
It's chic, it's fashionable,
it's modern.

1027
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:18,200
The boat looks like it was
professionally done even.

1028
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,700
You give very good mast-head.

1029
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,300
[laughter]

1030
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,066
- And P.S.,
fuck you for

1031
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,066
having the most amazing body
ever.

1032
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,166
[laughter]

1033
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,066
- Thank you, house of Willam.

1034
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,667
All right, up next,
Phi Phi O'Hara.

1035
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,667
- I just thought purple warrior

1036
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,066
princess when you came out.

1037
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,467
- I love your boat a lot.

1038
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,166
I love the way you coordinated

1039
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,166
the outfit with the boat.

1040
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,300
And your makeup--you're on
the right track.

1041
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,567
- I think you're like a
long-lost Kardashian sister.

1042
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:45,600
You're so beautiful.

1043
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,700
- Thank you.

1044
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,900
- My one critique is just watch

1045
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,133
out for your body shape still.

1046
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,467
Right, if you're gonna be wide

1047
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:52,667
there, then you got to give us

1048
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,100
more hips, so just pay attention

1049
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
to it, but you look stunning
tonight, baby.

1050
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,166
Keep this up.

1051
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,600
- Okay. I will.

1052
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,767
- All right, ladies, I think
we've heard enough.

1053
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:04,367
Now, while you untuck in
the interior illusions lounge,

1054
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,600
the judges and I will
deliberate.

1055
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,200
You may leave the stage.

1056
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,934
Now, just between us girls,
what do you think?

1057
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:15,066
Latrice Royale.

1058
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,900
- Latrice, I think,
is the real deal.

1059
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,200
The boat was very chic...

1060
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,533
- The makeup was truly artwork.

1061
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:22,900
Those friggin' boots.

1062
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,467
- Oh, my God, they're like

1063
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:25,900
Goth lesbian hiking boots.

1064
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,934
I will burn them.

1065
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,300
- All right, let's move on.

1066
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
Phi Phi O'Hara.

1067
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,700
- Before, I had a problem with

1068
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,166
the makeup every single time.

1069
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,767
Today was the best that it's
been.

1070
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,667
- She is listening, and I think

1071
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,800
the more we critique her,

1072
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,767
the more she'll get it.

1073
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,066
- On down the line we go to
Jiggly.

1074
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,734
- I would have loved all of it

1075
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,066
had she taken her cape off.

1076
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:44,333
It looked like a tent.

1077
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,867
- It almost looked like she was
walking in a straitjacket.

1078
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:47,734
- It's because she could barely
fit in the boat.

1079
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:48,700
- How very dare you?

1080
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,600
- What?
- Big is beautiful.

1081
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
- Love Jiggly.

1082
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Tonight it was an epic fail.

1083
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,834
- Chad Michaels,
the pink cougar.

1084
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:57,567
- Chad can do no wrong, but,

1085
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,600
see, now I'm starting to have
a problem with that.

1086
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,667
I want to see Chad be human
and not robotic.

1087
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,967
- I have to agree with you.

1088
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,400
I would like to see her a little
bit more messy.

1089
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,600
- Sharon Needles.

1090
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,667
- My mother's maiden name.

1091
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,100
- Your mother's maiden name is
Needles?

1092
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
- Sharon Needles.

1093
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,133
- [laughs]

1094
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,500
- I loved her whole snake
thing.

1095
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,533
- She's very H.R. Pufnstuf.

1096
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,633
[laughter]

1097
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:17,900
- I love the fact that she,
like,

1098
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,100
she didn't have perfect hair.

1099
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,633
It was a bit messy.

1100
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:23,066
All the stuff that we don't like
about Sharon Needles we love

1101
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,667
about Chad, and all the stuff we
don't like about Chad we love

1102
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,600
about Sharon Needles, so they
need to kind of, like, take tips

1103
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,567
from each other.

1104
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:28,767
- All right, Milan.

1105
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,400
- I think she thinks she's

1106
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
more real than she really is.

1107
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,633
- Like, she don't need padding.

1108
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:34,900
- Exactly.

1109
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,066
- And her body language is
totally "dude in a dress."

1110
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,433
- If she lip-synchs tonight and

1111
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,967
that wig comes off,
stop it already.

1112
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,967
- Right.
- All right, all right, Willam.

1113
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,066
- Does anyone really look like
that?

1114
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,200
My God.

1115
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,667
- How dare they have better
legs than me!

1116
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,433
How very dare they!

1117
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,066
- Now, Billy, you really liked

1118
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,433
the design of the float.

1119
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,734
- It was so well done.

1120
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:56,600
It wasn't as vulgar as Milan 's
was.

1121
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,066
- The fact that she got out of
it and then made a performance

1122
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,200
out of it was also very
entertaining as well.

1123
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,433
- Dida Ritz.

1124
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,700
- The outfit was very
pedestrian, very mall-like.

1125
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,066
- If Dida didn't wear a T-shirt,

1126
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,166
I would be saying something
completely different.

1127
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,266
- Right.

1128
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:10,533
- Does she deserve to be in the
bottom two

1129
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:11,533
because of the T-shirt?

1130
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,900
- Yeah!
- A T-shirt is half your outfit.

1131
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,066
- She was the only one up there
with a camel toe.

1132
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:17,467
- Hello!
- Very hot.

1133
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:18,834
- I didn't go there.

1134
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:19,867
[laughter]

1135
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,066
- You always have to go there,
darling.

1136
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,400
Especially when they're tucking.

1137
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,967
[laughter]

1138
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,667
- Silence!

1139
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,333
I've made my decision.

1140
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,800
Bring back...

1141
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,500
my girls.

1142
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,233
Welcome back, ladies.

1143
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,967
It was the late, great drag

1144
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,700
queen and civil rights pioneer

1145
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,600
Marsha P. Johnson who fought

1146
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,967
back when the police raided
Stonewall.

1147
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,867
To honor her legacy, it's up to

1148
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:50,567
you to keep on breaking through.

1149
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,734
Based on your pride-filled

1150
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:54,500
presentations, I've made some

1151
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,633
decisions.

1152
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:00,367
Chad Michaels, you're safe.

1153
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:04,567
- Thank you.

1154
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,700
- Latrice Royale...

1155
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,333
You're safe.

1156
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,834
- Thank you.

1157
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,767
- Sharon Needles...

1158
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:15,834
you're safe.

1159
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,300
- Thank you.

1160
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,433
- Willam, you navigated this

1161
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,700
challenge beautifully, and we

1162
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,467
were swept away.

1163
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,700
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.

1164
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,133
[applause]

1165
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,367
You will receive a cruise,

1166
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:38,066
courtesy of alandchuck.travel.

1167
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,100
- I'm okay with that.

1168
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,400
- [laughs]

1169
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,233
- It feels correct to win.

1170
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:44,133
When it's right, it's right.

1171
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,867
Yes, girl!

1172
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,066
- Phi Phi O'Hara...

1173
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,100
you're safe.

1174
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,300
- Thank you.

1175
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,266
- Jiggly Caliente...

1176
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,467
your message was uplifting,

1177
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,633
but your float left us with

1178
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,900
a sinking feeling.

1179
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,333
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

1180
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,433
- Fuck.

1181
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,200
I cannot go this far and get
sent home.

1182
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1183
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,300
- Dida Ritz, you're just

1184
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,433
finding your sea legs, but has

1185
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:21,633
the ship already sailed?

1186
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:24,734
Milan, you set a course for

1187
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:27,333
fabulous, but your message got

1188
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,300
lost at sea.

1189
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,667
Dida Ritz...

1190
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:35,200
I'm throwing you a lifeline.

1191
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,000
You're safe.

1192
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,767
- Thank you.

1193
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,000
- Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,

1194
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,266
but you are up for elimination.

1195
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,100
<i>- Ugh, I'm in the bottom again.</i>

1196
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,667
<i>But when it's time for me to</i>

1197
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,967
<i>bring it, I want to bring it.</i>

1198
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,500
<i>Because it's a competition and</i>

1199
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,066
<i>I'm here to win.</i>

1200
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,967
- Two queens stand before me.

1201
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:02,367
Ladies, this is your last chance

1202
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,734
to impress me and save yourself

1203
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,333
from elimination.

1204
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,500
The time has come for you to

1205
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,266
lip-synch for your life.

1206
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,567
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

1207
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,333

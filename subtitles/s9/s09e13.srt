00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,441
time for us to start writing
jokes.

47
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,975
Jokes.
Here's a tip, don't make it

48
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:12,010
here's a tip, don't make it
about my body.

49
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,712
About my body.
So, that's all I have to say

50
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:15,379
so, that's all I have to say
about that.

51
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,147
About that.
What do you say to that?

52
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:21,651
What do you say to that?
Um, regarding my sensitivity,

53
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,619
um, regarding my sensitivity,
my body is something that I have

54
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,022
my body is something that I have
struggled with my whole life.

55
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:28,256
Struggled with my whole life.
And we have have talked about

56
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,625
and we have have talked about
our body image issues a few

57
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,192
our body image issues a few
weeks before.

58
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,327
Weeks before.
Yeah, but the reading

59
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,762
yeah, but the reading
challenge is a safe place to let

60
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,630
challenge is a safe place to let
it all hang out because you no

61
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:38,530
it all hang out because you no
there's love in the room.

62
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,998
There's love in the room.
And the love came from me to

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,232
and the love came from me to
the girls too.

64
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:43,267
The girls too.
And because we talked about

65
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:44,701
and because we talked about
other eating disorders...

66
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,235
Other eating disorders...
Yeah, I got it.

67
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,970
Yeah, I got it.
Surely you can understand why

68
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:49,938
surely you can understand why
people online would say, waumt,

69
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,806
people online would say, waumt,
you know, having talked about

70
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:54,875
you know, having talked about
the other body sensitivities.

71
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,509
The other body sensitivities.
It was just, it did not feel

72
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,009
it was just, it did not feel
balanced.

73
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,111
Balanced. I talked about being

74
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,113
I talked about being
sensitive about my teeth, but

75
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,279
sensitive about my teeth, but
that doesn't stop you.

76
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,580
That doesn't stop you.
And I was still able to sit

77
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,214
and I was still able to sit
there and laugh about it and I

78
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,281
there and laugh about it and I
just felt like you were not

79
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:06,148
just felt like you were not
being a good sport.

80
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,916
Being a good sport.
I make fun of my size all the

81
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:10,518
I make fun of my size all the
time on stage at my shows.

82
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,752
Time on stage at my shows.
That's not her point.

83
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,220
That's not her point.
I don't think that you come

84
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,888
I don't think that you come
off as like some huge size

85
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,355
off as like some huge size
queen.

86
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:15,988
Queen. I agree.

87
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,621
I agree. Yeah.

88
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,956
Yeah.
I think the gripe that people

89
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,891
I think the gripe that people
had online, was that you dished

90
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:23,994
had online, was that you dished
it out, basically calling Farrah

91
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,696
it out, basically calling Farrah
a prostitute and turnabout was

92
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,797
a prostitute and turnabout was
not fair play.

93
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,431
Not fair play.
My advice is girl you are a

94
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,965
my advice is girl you are a
drag queen, and if you can't

95
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,199
drag queen, and if you can't
roll with the punches, this is

96
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,500
roll with the punches, this is
not the career for you.

97
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,635
Not the career for you.
You know, this won't air, but

98
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:38,170
you know, this won't air, but
lady bunny and I used the to do

99
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,037
lady bunny and I used the to do
acid together.

100
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,638
Acid together.
And we were custodies.

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,872
And we were custodies.
Inevitably, she'd say to me and

102
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,407
inevitably, she'd say to me and
look at me, and say, ru, the

103
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,343
look at me, and say, ru, the
devil's going to get you.

104
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:48,977
Devil's going to get you.
And I said, why are you doing

105
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,410
and I said, why are you doing
that?

106
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:52,780
That?
I'm tripping my balls off and

107
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,215
I'm tripping my balls off and
you are bringing up this stuff.

108
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,517
You are bringing up this stuff.
But in hindsight, what she was

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,019
but in hindsight, what she was
doing was taking away all the

110
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,521
doing was taking away all the
things, and you are like, oh,

111
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,722
things, and you are like, oh,
wait a minute, there's nothing

112
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,190
wait a minute, there's nothing
to it and that's what reading is

113
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:05,857
to it and that's what reading is
all about.

114
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,126
All about.
What I'm trying to do now is

115
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,026
what I'm trying to do now is
not take it all so seriously.

116
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:12,194
Not take it all so seriously.
I have a question, if you

117
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:13,562
I have a question, if you
were to get read right now,

118
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,897
were to get read right now,
could you take it?

119
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,667
Could you take it?
Well, I have reading glasses

120
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:20,234
well, I have reading glasses
right here.

121

123
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,005
Library is open.
Let's start with Trinity.

124
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:29,575
Let's start with Trinity.
Alexis, I love your costume.

125
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:32,077
Alexis, I love your costume.
You look just like a honey baked

126
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,510
you look just like a honey baked
ham.

127
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,979
Ham. After all that.

128
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,480
After all that.
Here's... go right back.

129
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:37,681
Here's... go right back.
You can take it now.

130
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:40,050
You can take it now.
I can take it, I can take it.

131
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:41,052
I can take it, I can take it.

133
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,486
Here we go.
I love your costume, that's

134
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,621
I love your costume, that's
why I call you the Joan of ark

135
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:49,124
why I call you the Joan of ark
of drag, great ideas and badly

136
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:49,657
of drag, great ideas and badly
executed.

137
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,225
Executed.
It's getting hot in here.

138
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:54,695
It's getting hot in here.
Oh, yeah, I had a good read

139
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:55,495
oh, yeah, I had a good read
for Valentina, but I can't

140
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,731
for Valentina, but I can't
remember the word.

141
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,400
Remember the word.
That was good.

142
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,236
That was good.
That was, good, girl.

143
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,805
That was, good, girl.
Trinity is so fishy, all she.

144
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,973
Trinity is so fishy, all she
is serving is Fisher price.

145
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,776
Is serving is Fisher price.
Bitch, you look like fish, a

146
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:13,243
bitch, you look like fish, a
whale.

147
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,744
Whale.
Honey I'm James and the giant

148
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,979
honey I'm James and the giant
peach and not afraid of it.

149
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:21,283
Peach and not afraid of it.
Bitch, you ate James and the

150
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,984
bitch, you ate James and the
giant peach.

151
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:24,585
Giant peach.
Didn't know you were here

152
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,720
didn't know you were here
until your nose walked in,

153
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:27,187
until your nose walked in,
bitch.

154
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,455
Bitch. Don't try it, bitch.

155
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,956
Don't try it, bitch.
All right...

156
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,257
All right... I had so much more.

157
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,092
I had so much more.
I know you did, the library

158
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:36,094
I know you did, the library

159
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:36,561

160
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:37,161
Closed. Praise god.

00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:37,728
Praise god. Amen.

162
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,429
Amen. This year was a season of

163
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,431
this year was a season of
shocking eliminations.

164
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:42,031
Shocking eliminations.
And I'm not talking about what

165
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,567
and I'm not talking about what
guess on between you and your

166
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,603
guess on between you and your
squatty potty, first up, Charlie

squatty potty, first up, Charlie
hides.

168
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,305
Hides.
I hate to say this, my dear, but

169
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:53,473
I hate to say this, my dear, but
your lip sync for your life was

170
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,475
your lip sync for your life was
dead on arrival.

171
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:56,509
Dead on arrival. Girl.

172
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,309
Girl. Charlie, what happened?

173
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:59,177
Charlie, what happened?
Well, I think you all know

Cheerleading, I cracked my rib.
And I was in pain.

177
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,517
And I was in pain.
And my British stiff upper lip,

178
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,385
and my British stiff upper lip,
I just said, don't show signs on

179

I just said, don't show signs on
weaknesses and so, I you kept it

180
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,086
weaknesses and so, I you kept it
to myself.

181
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,354
To myself.

have a cracked rib.

188
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,135
Have a cracked rib.
I make Sushi, I do it twice a

189
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,703
I make Sushi, I do it twice a
year, and I'm not good at it.

190
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:37,272
Year, and I'm not good at it.
The things I do regularly I'm

191
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,206
the things I do regularly I'm
better at.

192
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,441
Better at.
We do Sushi on the show.

193
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,141
We do Sushi on the show. Yeah.

194
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,976
Yeah.
Cracked rib or not, girl, you

195
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:43,476
cracked rib or not, girl, you
gave up.

196
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,278
Gave up.
Do you know that I had duct

197
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,178
do you know that I had duct
taped my rib cage.

198
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,013
Taped my rib cage.
Girl, you walked all the way

199
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:50,748
girl, you walked all the way
down the runway, I saw you

200
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,850
down the runway, I saw you
moving around that work room.

201
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:53,951
Moving around that work room.
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

202
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,385
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.
All right, there was a side

203
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,253
all right, there was a side
of me that said, that you just,

204
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,055
of me that said, that you just,
if I had moved a little bit to

205
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,489
if I had moved a little bit to
the left and a little bit to the

206
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,457
the left and a little bit to the
right, which is what I was

207
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,624
right, which is what I was
capable of, it was going to be

208
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,057
capable of, it was going to be
lame.

209
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,658
Lame. It's not about moving, lip

210
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,426
it's not about moving, lip
sync happens up here not down

211
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:07,859
sync happens up here not down
here.

212
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,060
Here.
It's the passion, you looked

213
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:09,794
it's the passion, you looked
like you gave up.

214
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,962
Like you gave up.
I did the song, the brittney

215
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,464
I did the song, the brittney
Spears song is the sub text of

216
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,333
Spears song is the sub text of
the song is masterbation, it was

217
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:17,933
the song is masterbation, it was
a bad choice.

218
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:22,003
A bad choice.
This is the thing if you were

219
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,270
this is the thing if you were
masterbating, we were not

220
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,505
masterbating, we were not
getting off, girl.

221
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:28,040
Getting off, girl.
I don't like her, but if she

222
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,808
I don't like her, but if she
can do what she did after her

223
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,909
can do what she did after her
knee injury, there's no excuse

224
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:31,409
knee injury, there's no excuse
for you.

225
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:34,044
For you.
If you are going to have an

226
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,246
if you are going to have an
excuse, pick one and not five.

227
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,214
Excuse, pick one and not five.
I did not have very much

228
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:38,647
I did not have very much left.

229
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,315
Left.
It was at the end of a long day.

230
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,683
It was at the end of a long day.
At the end of a long week.

231
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:45,620
At the end of a long week.
I was getting an hour and a

232
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:46,287
I was getting an hour and a
half sleep anight.

233
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:46,887
Half sleep anight. So were we.

234
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,222
So were we.
I'm trying to figure out is

235
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:51,324
I'm trying to figure out is
it a broken rib, or...

236
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:52,591
It a broken rib, or...
I saw online that you said

237
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,326
I saw online that you said
you had diarrhea.

238
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:56,695
You had diarrhea.
On the first day of

239
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:58,763
on the first day of
rehearsing... but that was long

240
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,230
rehearsing... but that was long
passed.

241
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:02,366
Passed. It was a rough day for

242
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:02,833
it was a rough day for Charlie.

243
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:03,733
Charlie.
I fainted in my hotel room

244
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:08,871
I fainted in my hotel room
and I did the lip sync and I did

245
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:09,838
and I did the lip sync and I did
it a day after.

246
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,072
It a day after.
Did you give up because you were

247
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,006
did you give up because you were
ready to go home?

248
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,073
Ready to go home?
I said before, I was on

249
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,506
I said before, I was on empty.

250
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,875
Empty. Charlie did you tell Nina

251
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,343
Charlie did you tell Nina
that you wanted to go home?

252
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:18,310
That you wanted to go home?
I don't remember saying that,

253
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:18,710
I don't remember saying that,
no.

254
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,278
No. Well, let's take a look at

255
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,512
well, let's take a look at
this never before scene clip.

256
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,579
This never before scene clip.
Oh, lord.

257
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,647
Oh, lord. Charlie didn't you...

258
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,249
Charlie didn't you...
Can I get in there.

259
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,384
Can I get in there.
She threw the towel in.

260
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:31,919
She threw the towel in.
She talked to me and said,

261
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:37,958
she talked to me and said,
she was not going learn the

262
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,193
she was not going learn the
words of the song, she didn't

263
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:41,827
words of the song, she didn't
really want to.

264
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,795
Really want to.
So I think she is ready to go

265
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:44,762
so I think she is ready to go
home if it's time.

266
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,330
Home if it's time.
She didn't know the words to the

267
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:46,763
she didn't know the words to the
song.

268
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:47,630
Song. So she was like...

269
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:48,897
So she was like...
I feel like the moment you

270
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,732
I feel like the moment you
don't try for a lip sync is the

271
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,567
don't try for a lip sync is the
moment when you are saying I'm

272
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:56,037
moment when you are saying I'm
too good for this.

273
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,604
Too good for this. Oh.

274
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,539
Oh. So, she did tell you that,

275
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:58,972
so, she did tell you that, then.

276
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,540
Then.
I never said that I was too

277
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:00,973
I never said that I was too
good.

278
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,607
Good.
And can I say I'm sorry if you

279
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,774
and can I say I'm sorry if you
thought I was disrespecting you

280
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,041
thought I was disrespecting you
by giving up and not you have

281
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:05,975
by giving up and not you have
doing everything that I had.

282
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,544
Doing everything that I had.
No, it's true with all of you

283
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:08,977
no, it's true with all of you
girls.

284
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,145
Girls.
I have seen your audition tapes

285
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,479
I have seen your audition tapes
and some of you I have seen year

286
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,813
and some of you I have seen year
after year after year, and then

287
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,481
after year after year, and then
I see you in group.

288
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,016
I see you in group.
I get inspired of what you give

289
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,385
I get inspired of what you give
to the competition.

290
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,719
To the competition.
And then when someone doesn't

291
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,387
and then when someone doesn't
give it their all, I'm

292
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:23,954
give it their all, I'm
disappointed.

293
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,488
Disappointed.
Listen, you may not be the

When I was doing the

314
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:13,491
when I was doing the
cheerleading challenge, I landed

315
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,960
cheerleading challenge, I landed
wrong and my knee popped.

316
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,163
Wrong and my knee popped.
I've been able to push through,

317
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,598
I've been able to push through,
but now it's hurtdhurting and I

I come from a small town, I

330
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,459
I come from a small town, I
never really belonged anywhere

331
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:59,261

everyone.

443
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,732
Everyone.
That I saw the notebook with the

444
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,033
that I saw the notebook with the
words written out and I want

445
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,300
words written out and I want
everyone to know that the girl

446
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:50,733
everyone to know that the girl
tried.

447
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:55,604
Tried.
I know you are trying to get

448
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:56,538
I know you are trying to get

449
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,639
redemption from her fans, but

450
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,439
redemption from her fans, but
let's be real.

451
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:03,210
Let's be real.
You lip synced against her.

452
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:06,079
You lip synced against her.
I don't get why there was so

453
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,013
I don't get why there was so
much hate for me.

454
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,548
Much hate for me.
For doing what was asked of me

455
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:16,021
for doing what was asked of me
in lip sync of my life.

456
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,522
In lip sync of my life.
Why do you think your fans

457
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,656
why do you think your fans
came for the girls?

458
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,957
Came for the girls?
I represent something similar

459
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,825
I represent something similar
to what salina represented in.

460
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:25,295
TO WHAT SALINA REPRESENTED IN
THE '90s.

461
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,063
THE '90s.
Mexican, FIRST GENERATION,

462
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,065
Mexican, first generation,
talented, so they are over

463
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,732
talented, so they are over
protective of that and they will

464
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:30,332
protective of that and they will
fight anybody.

465
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,000
Fight anybody.
I don't agree with that kind of

466
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:33,134
I don't agree with that kind of
behavior, it's not the kind of

467
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:33,734
behavior, it's not the kind of
person I am.

468
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:35,836
Person I am.
Why don't you say that on the

469
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:36,269
why don't you say that on the
media.

470
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:41,340
Media. Holdup.

471
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:42,074
Holdup. You are a role model.

472
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,042
You are a role model.
I don't approve of that.

473
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,009
I don't approve of that.
You never said that.

474
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,411
You never said that.
I facetimed you in tears because

475
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,413
I facetimed you in tears because
people said I should kill myself

476
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,348
people said I should kill myself
because I'm ugly and fat and I

477
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,384
because I'm ugly and fat and I
should volunteer to elimination

478
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:54,851
should volunteer to elimination
myself.

479
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,785
Myself.
I don't think she enkrenls

480
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,820
I don't think she enkrenls
that, but you could say, I don't

481
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,254
that, but you could say, I don't
agree with the way you are

482
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,154
agree with the way you are
treating this girl.

483
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:00,721
Treating this girl. Please stop.

484
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:03,523
Please stop.
I'm bad with social media.

485
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,425
I'm bad with social media.
I love to live my every day

486
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:06,858
I love to live my every day
life.

487
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,060
Life.
And I don't want to be involved

488
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,127
and I don't want to be involved
in what people think or say.

489
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,394
In what people think or say.
You can say that, but you

490
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,661
you can say that, but you
were on the phone checking every

491
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:15,063

like and every follow and every

like and every follow and every
single thing in Toronto.

493
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,300
Single thing in Toronto.
Whether you were reading the

494
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:20,167
whether you were reading the
comments verbatim or not, you

495
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,134
comments verbatim or not, you
knew what was going on.

496
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:23,202
Knew what was going on.
When we were shooting the promo

497
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:24,670
when we were shooting the promo
for this show, you said to me,

00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,471
for this show, you said to me,
shea, I just want to say, if

499
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:29,140
shea, I just want to say, if
anyone comes for Nina, I told

500
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:31,509

her that I will stand up for her

it all right.

503
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:34,844
It all right. And I'm confused.

504
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:36,345
And I'm confused.
You don't need to be

505
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,813
you don't need to be
confused, you have a lot of

506
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,281
confused, you have a lot of
opinions of me tonight, shea.

507
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,851
Opinions of me tonight, shea.
There's no reason to get

508
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:43,585
there's no reason to get
upset, we are talking.

509
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,820
Upset, we are talking.
You are upset, I'm not upset.

510
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,388
You are upset, I'm not upset.
Do I look upset to you?

511
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,889
Do I look upset to you?
Yes, you raised your voice

512
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:49,389
yes, you raised your voice
with me.

513
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,191
With me. Listen, it's a lot for

514
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:53,058
listen, it's a lot for anyone.

515
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,928
Anyone.
Especially someone who has

516
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,096
especially someone who has
300,000, 500,000 followers don't

517
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,832
300,000, 500,000 followers don't
you understand that may be

518
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,033
you understand that may be
intimidating for her?

519
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,667
Intimidating for her?
I don't think it fair for you to

520
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:05,601
I don't think it fair for you to
disconnect when they are coming

521
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:07,102
disconnect when they are coming
after us so hard.

522
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,236
After us so hard. No, excuse me.

523
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,605
No, excuse me.

Right now?
Yes, I don't agree with that

530
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,311
yes, I don't agree with that
type of behavior where it's

531
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:20,844
type of behavior where it's
negative.

532
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:21,911
Negative. I'm very sorry.

00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,521
Thank you.
In that moment, I will be

542
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,723
in that moment, I will be
honest, I was disconnect from

543
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,524
honest, I was disconnect from
everyone and everything, because

544
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,492
everyone and everything, because
I'm trying to process my

545
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,726
I'm trying to process my
elimination, I was torn for

546
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:44,193
elimination, I was torn for
months.

547
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:44,760
Months. I was lost.

548
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,394
I was lost.
I know, you called me, I

549
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:46,894
I know, you called me, I
remember.

550
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,262
Remember. No, we did talk.

551
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:50,130
No, we did talk.
I couldn't leave the house.

552
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,798
I couldn't leave the house.
I couldn't process the

553
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,765
I couldn't process the
disappointment that I felt from

554
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,166
disappointment that I felt from
you saying that you could have

555
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,233
you saying that you could have
gone all the way.

556
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:56,834
Gone all the way.
I felt like you stopped

557
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:57,768
I felt like you stopped
believing in me.

558
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,669
Believing in me.
I chose every single one of

559
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,270
I chose every single one of
you girls to be on the show and

560
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,005
you girls to be on the show and

561
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,539
I have the highest hopes for all
of you.

562
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,973
Of you.
Buts that competition/reality

563
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:09,910
buts that competition/reality
show, it's not "rupaul's best"

564
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:10,844
show, it's not "rupaul's best
friend's race" and contrariy to

565
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,312
"friend's race" and contrariy to
what is happening in the world,

566
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:14,881
what is happening in the world,
where people get a trophy for

567
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:15,448
where people get a trophy for
showing up.

568
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,516
- Showing up.
- If you up, you are in

569
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:18,783
if you up, you are in
the bottom two, if you are in

570
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,317
the bottom two, if you are in
the bottom two, you have to lip

571
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,184
the bottom two, you have to lip
sync for your life.

572
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,086
Sync for your life.
No matter how pretty or old you

573
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,121
no matter how pretty or old you
are, you are gone, that is how

574
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,088
are, you are gone, that is how
the game is played.

575
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,956
The game is played.
There's so much to learn from

576
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,390
there's so much to learn from
my elimination about who I am

577
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,925
my elimination about who I am
and there's so much that I want

578
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:33,625
and there's so much that I want
to show now.

579
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,360
To show now.
Although, it's not the way that

580
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:37,729
although, it's not the way that
I wanted to leave.

581
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:38,830
I wanted to leave.
But it was a darn good episode

582
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:43,167
but it was a darn good episode
and I got my telenovela ending.

583
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,037
And I got my telenovela ending.
Valentina, speaking of

584
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,876
Valentina, speaking of
telenovela drama, there were

585
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:54,510
telenovela drama, there were
choice words for you.

586
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:59,581
Choice words for you.
What did they say?

the moment and you have
something to say, say it.

So when Valentina was getting so

610
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,012
so when Valentina was getting so
much praise for being a gorgeous

611
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,679
much praise for being a gorgeous
beautiful model.

612
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,312
Beautiful model. Which she is.

613
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:42,845
Which she is. She is.

614
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,615
She is.
She is kind of a psycho, but

615
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:47,282
she is kind of a psycho, but
she is beautiful.

616
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:49,217
She is beautiful.
And that day, I really had felt

617
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,551
and that day, I really had felt
like she doesn't deserve to be

618
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,585
like she doesn't deserve to be
in the top.

619
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:52,652
In the top. And I was over it.

620
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,320
And I was over it.
I was like, girl, and then I,

621
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,322
I was like, girl, and then I,
you know, I don't want to say I

622
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,224
you know, I don't want to say I
read her, I aggressively

623
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,658
read her, I aggressively
complimented her and I let her

624
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,893
complimented her and I let her
know how beautiful she was.

625
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:03,727
Know how beautiful she was.
You could see how happy I

626
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:04,127
you could see how happy I was.

627
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,261
Was. I was like, yes, girl.

628
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,095
I was like, yes, girl. Get her.

629
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,163
Get her. Get her aja, get her.

630
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,198
Get her aja, get her.
I think a lot of us had the

631
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,966
I think a lot of us had the
feeling that as you were saying

632
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,734
feeling that as you were saying
it, there was a bit of a silent

633
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:14,167
it, there was a bit of a silent
amen.

634
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,201
Amen. Oh, yeah.

635
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:15,868
Oh, yeah. There was.

636
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,135
There was.
We didn't understand why

637
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:18,503
we didn't understand why
Valentina was in the top that

638
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,036
Valentina was in the top that
challenge.

639
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,771
Challenge.
A lot of us didn't necessarily

640
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:22,038
a lot of us didn't necessarily
appreciate the charm that

641
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,672
appreciate the charm that
Valentina was conveying to

642
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:24,739
Valentina was conveying to
camera, because to be honest,

643
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:26,640
camera, because to be honest,
girl, you are not making an

644
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,541
girl, you are not making an
attempt to really get to know us

645
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,875
attempt to really get to know us
back stage at that point.

646
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,509
Back stage at that point.

You wanted to be on the show

649
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,778
you wanted to be on the show
because you wanted to be a star.

650
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,745
Because you wanted to be a star.
I didn't want to be a star.

651
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:37,912
I didn't want to be a star.
I wanted to show the star that I

652
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:38,312
I wanted to show the star that I
am.

yesterday.

What we just heard was there

703
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,059
what we just heard was there
was a conspiracy theory that

704
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:29,563
was a conspiracy theory that
sounded more like paranoia.

705
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:32,666
Sounded more like paranoia.
Girls are saying, she is not

706

original and she is not funny.

Original and she is not funny.
Who is saying that?

708
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,036
Who is saying that? You.

709
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,370
You. I don't play those games.

732
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,629
For her?
She seems like she is giving up.

She seems like she is giving up.
That's what was being said?

734
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,431
That's what was being said?

00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:05,476
in front of the judges
considering they had nothing to

886
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:07,811
considering they had nothing to
say to me about it in the work

887
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:08,344
say to me about it in the work
room.

888
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:11,313
Room. Shady...

889
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,882
Shady...
Shea and Sasha, Alexis felt

890
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,283
shea and Sasha, Alexis felt
that you should have given

891
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,718
that you should have given
feedback, is it a given that you

892
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,619
feedback, is it a given that you
all give each other feedback?

893
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:20,419
All give each other feedback?
No.

894
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:23,321
No. And, and to be realistic,

895
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:25,256
and, and to be realistic,
there was feedback that Trinity

896
00:28:25,258 --> 00:28:28,626
there was feedback that Trinity
was giving to you, Alexis, and I

897
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:30,327
was giving to you, Alexis, and I
did not see you accept or take

898
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:32,329
did not see you accept or take
it on, so, for me in this

899
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:33,763
it on, so, for me in this
moment, I was just like, why

900
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:34,497
moment, I was just like, why
waste my breath.

901
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:36,232
Waste my breath.
You know, you were very much

902
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:37,366
you know, you were very much
committed to your vision and who

903
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:39,668
committed to your vision and who
am I to sit here and tell you

904
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,002
am I to sit here and tell you
not to follow your vision.

905
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:44,705
Not to follow your vision.
You know you are stubborn.

906
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:46,139
You know you are stubborn.
Don't you?

907
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,275
Don't you?
I do, I'm like a bulldog.

908
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,010
I do, I'm like a bulldog.
I want to say, shea, I do not

909
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:53,078
I want to say, shea, I do not
disagree with you, in that, I

910
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,779
disagree with you, in that, I
did need to step up my forward

911
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:55,479
did need to step up my forward
thinking eye.

912
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:58,448
Thinking eye.
But bitch I challenge you to

913
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,516
but bitch I challenge you to
find anybody that can do what I

914
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:00,916

do.

915
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:02,817
Do.
Nobody can do Alexis Michelle

916
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:04,418
nobody can do Alexis Michelle
like Alexis Michelle.

917
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,222
Like Alexis Michelle.
Sasha, Alexis thought your

918
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:10,122
Sasha, Alexis thought your
look was pedestrian, what do you

919
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:10,722
look was pedestrian, what do you
think of that?

920
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:13,157
Think of that?
That is ironic, to my face,

921
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:14,825
that is ironic, to my face,
he was encouraging of the outfit

922
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:19,362
he was encouraging of the outfit
is what you accused us of doing.

923
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:20,629
Is what you accused us of doing.
What I was referring to was

924
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:22,597
what I was referring to was
the turtle neck and pencil

925
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,665
the turtle neck and pencil
skirt, what makes Sasha Sasha is

926
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,199
skirt, what makes Sasha Sasha is
how you put it together and make

927
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:32,672
how you put it together and make
it look elevated and artistic

928
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:33,305
it look elevated and artistic
with a message.

929
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,706
With a message.

to me.

932
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:37,941
To me. It was.

933
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,877
It was.
Peppermint, how did you feel

934
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,777
peppermint, how did you feel
about Trinity saying that your

935
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,112
about Trinity saying that your
look was not polished?

936
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,480
Look was not polished?
She didn't say it to my face.

937
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:51,519
She didn't say it to my face.
No, no, no, yes, I did, yes,

938
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,052

00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:54,386
I said, you need to pay
attention to the details.

941
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:55,220
Attention to the details.
I did say that.

942
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,721
I did say that.
I felt like your garment was not

943
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:58,556
I felt like your garment was not
up to par to the rest of us.

944
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,560
Up to par to the rest of us.
I actually liked Alexis' outfit

945
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:05,162
I actually liked Alexis' outfit
more so than yours.

946
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:06,296
More so than yours. All right.

Feels really good.

If she was able to figure out

982
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:15,881
if she was able to figure out
a way to lip sync without

983
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:17,816
a way to lip sync without

Candy machine? What?

Maggots, I never got candy.
I was asking Carson if you

994
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,566

995
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:40,333
had a rib removed because you
are so tiny.

996
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:41,200

you would not have just dropped
me.

1182
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:18,809
Me. You think that you want a

1183
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,244
you think that you want a
friendship, text me, call me,

1184
00:38:21,246 --> 00:38:21,944
friendship, text me, call me,
let's talk about it.

1185
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:24,246
Let's talk about it.
I have texted you, you

1186
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:29,150
I have texted you, you
ignored my texts.

1187
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:30,017
Ignored my texts.
You finally responded when you

1188
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:30,951
you finally responded when you
got eliminated, I texted you and

1189
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,786
got eliminated, I texted you and
said, are you okay, and you said

1190
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:33,788
said, are you okay, and you said
let's talk about it.

1191
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:34,554
Let's talk about it.
Let's talk about it.

1192
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,456
Let's talk about it.
You don't seem to have time

1193
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:37,956
you don't seem to have time
or desire.

1194
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,190
Or desire.
You are clearly not focused

1195
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,460
you are clearly not focused
on anything but yourself.

1196
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:45,795
On anything but yourself.
Is it fan favorite or

1197
00:38:45,797 --> 00:38:46,362
is it fan favorite or
congeniality?

1198
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,097
Congeniality?
Fan favorite, then she

1199
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:48,664
fan favorite, then she
deserves it.

1200
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,233
Deserves it.
Then we should call it fan

1201
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:51,733
then we should call it fan
favorite.

1202
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:54,602
Favorite.
But congeniality, I don't see.

1203
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:58,373
But congeniality, I don't see.
Fan favorite, congratul

1204
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,207
fan favorite, congratul
congratulations, let's make a

Yeah. Valentina on the show, I

1223

Valentina on the show, I
thought you only thought about

1224
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,689

yourself, which is partially

1225
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:26,122
yourself, which is partially
true.

1226
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:27,289
True. What isn't true?

1227
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,725
What isn't true?
But Farrah moan, shut up

but Farrah moan, shut up
already.

1229
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:33,227
Already.
Regardless of what anybody

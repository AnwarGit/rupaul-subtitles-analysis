- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
You'll be launching
your very own dragazine.
- Sex sells, people, sex sells.
- Ha ha.
I'm a successful drag queen.
I'm not like some club queen
who has to show for a dollar.
- You have to spot me.
- That looks like a man.
I look like Sharon in that one.
- Ouch.
- Your dragazine cover
is possibly the worst one.
I hate the font.
- Me too.
- The eyes scare me.
- They're my trademark.
- It creeps me out.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- [laughs]
Ah, finally!
- Willam, shante, you stay.
Jiggly Caliente--
may I call you Jiggly?
- Yes.
- Sashay away.
And tonight, you'll be competing
as a couple...
of frenemies.
The jig is up.
If Phi Phi O'Hara was the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
And a shocking twist...
- [vomiting]
- It's really not cute.
- With extra-special
guest judges
Pamela Anderson
and Jennifer Tilly.
[cheers and applause]
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
[tires squealing]
Walking in today
to Jiggly being gone
is obviously mind-boggling,
'cause there's only
six people left.
- [singing]
- Yo, that's a lot of lipstick.
- "To my bitches, love you all
to death, Jiggly Caliente."
At least the lipstick's
on the mirror
and not on her teeth for once.
Bye, girl, bye.
That was my first time
in the bottom two.
I wasn't happy to be up there,
and I know I was trying
to be pretty at least.
- Did it humble you?
- It didn't add
any humility to me.
- Humble pie is what
Willam should be.
If it was anybody else
other than Jiggly,
she would have went home
last night.
- Girl, you were so pissy
and fussy up there, girl.
Ooh!
- Any way to keep
my dress moving
and to keep me
sparkling a little bit.
- Mew mew doesn't make
talent, honey.
- My last performance
wasn't my best,
but it was enough
to keep me here.
- You girls told me to take
those damn white contacts
out of my eyes before Runway,
and I didn't.
I said I wanted 'em.
They looked pretty.
And they totally got me.
So now I have to, like, serve up
some girly-girl nonsense.
- Like, can you leave your
gothic and your vampire,
like, that type of look aside,
and just do, like,
glamorous, pretty?
- But I think I am glamorous.
Can I do a lemming look?
Sure, I can throw myself
off of a cliff with you,
but I don't want to.
I am no longer justifying
my personal beauty
to these girls.
No one remembers the girl with
the tan skin and the blond hair.
They remember the girl coughing
up blood with white eyes.
- What I read in my makeup
and everything,
I want the judges to know
that I am listening
and I want to be here--
- You did a great job.
- And I want to take
all their critiques in.
- Like, standing next to you
when you won,
you, like, kind of
threw your head back
and I saw, like,
the square sideburn.
- Oh, picking straws, dude.
- Hold on, I'm still
complimenting you
in your appearance
that was like--
- That's, like,
a backhanded compliment.
I'm tired of her
and I want her to go home.
I thought it looked gorgeous,
and if I can rock a sideburns
and win a challenge,
then I'm gonna rock a sideburn
and win a challenge.
They liked it.
- Everybody want Willam
to go home.
She is completely annoying.
- Well, congratulations, whore.
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi.
- Two challenges ago,
I was in the bottom three,
and now I'm in the top.
- So, Phi Phi,
what took you so long?
[alarm wails]
- Ooh!
- Girl, you've got shemail.
<i>You know, there are two things</i>
<i>I don't like about you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Your face.</i>
<i>[gasps]</i>
<i>Ladies, keep your friends close</i>
<i>and you frenemies even closer,</i>
<i>'cause in this competition,</i>
<i>even the mirror has two faces.</i>
<i>Yeah, and one of 'em is</i>
<i>cracked.</i>
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Oh, you shut up!</i>
<i>I'm not listening to you.</i>
<i>La la la la la la la.</i>
<i>Bitch, I'll be waiting for</i>
<i>your ass in the parking lot.</i>
<i>Bitch.</i>
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru!
- RuPaul!
- Ladies, in a competition,
people can say one thing
to your face
and then talk smack
behind your back.
Sometimes it's hard to know
who your real friends are.
For today's mini challenge,
I'm not looking
for a winner or a loser.
I'm looking for the truth,
and you can't handle
the truth, girl.
One by one,
you'll be hooked
to a lie detector,
a little lady go by the name
of "Polly Graph."
Know her?
I thought you did.
- I'm worried she's gonna ask me
some questions
I don't want to answer.
- Time to spill it, girls.
[laughter]
Welcome, darling.
Now, I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.
You answer each
with a simple yes or a no.
Is that clear?
- Yes.
- John, are you all set?
- I am.
- Are you now
or have you ever been
a biological woman?
- No.
- Have you ever worn
women's clothing?
- Yes.
- Do you sleep in the nude?
- No.
- Just as I suspected.
- If Sharon Needles were
the last ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- No.
- If Phi Phi O'Hara was
the last ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- Yes.
- If Willam were the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- No.
- If Latrice were the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Interesting.
[beeping]
Do you think Willam
is prettier than you?
- Yes.
- No.
- No.
- Have you ever talked shade
behind Chad Michaels' back?
- No.
- Do you think you could win
a lip-sync for your life
against Sharon Needles?
- Yes.
- Have you ever lied
about your age?
- Yes.
- Fascinating.
- Do you think Willam
is annoying?
- Yes.
- Have you ever
looked at the pit crew
with lust in your heart?
- No.
- No.
- Yes.
- Do you like my line
of iron fist shoes?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Last question:
Are you the future of drag?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Your questioning is over.
I will supply the FBI with
a copy of your transcripts.
Ladies, the results are in.
In addition to the truth,
your answers revealed to me
a lot about your different
personality types.
Now, I've arranged you
in two lines.
Look at the queen directly
across from you.
That's the person you have
the least in common with,
someone you might not even
like very much,
but that queen possesses skills
and traits you don't have,
and in a crisis,
she could save your ass.
That means, Dida Ritz, you're
paired with Chad Michaels.
Willam, you're paired
with Latrice Royale.
- Oh, evil.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you're paired
with Sharon Needles.
- Party City.
- Busted showgirl.
- For this week's
main challenge,
you need to put together
a nightclub act
sponsored by NYX cosmetics,
and you'll be competing
as a couple...
of frenemies.
Now, each pair will create
costumes, choreography,
and specialty lyrics
to the original song,
<i>Better Than You.</i>
Oh, and tomorrow
on the main stage,
you'll be singing it live...
- What?
[laughs] What?
- No lip-syncing.
- I don't sing live, boo-boo.
There's a reason
why I lip-sync.
- In the tradition
of famous frenemies
like Joan Crawford
and Bette Davis.
Time to make nice,
girls, or just fake it,
you know,
like I'm always doing.
[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
See ya.
[laughs]
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye.
- O-m-g.
- Have you listened to it yet?
- No.
- It seems like the mindset
amongst the queens is that
you're only as good
as your last performance,
but I'm a singer,
I have a band,
and I plan to win
this challenge,
and I want to prove that I'm
not just some lip-syncing queen.
I think it's kind of
natural too,
because my voice is probably
an octave higher
than yours,
so it'll sound good.
- [laughs]
Okay.
- Why don't we do,
like, the elphaba--
like, a<i> Wicked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>
- Ooh, I like devil and angel.
It's better,
and it's how people see us.
- I'm not sure how Phi Phi and
Sharon are gonna work together.
They're the most opposite,
and they've also had
a little tiff.
Should we rewind that back?
- Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck you.
- "Tired-ass showgirl"?
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!
Go back to Party City,
where you belong!
- If the chemistry's not there,
then it shows through on stage.
- Okay.
- We can play off that
showgirl/Party City thing.
- We can just write
Party City/busted showgirl,
as who you are.
[laughs]
Busted showgirl,
which I'm sure you don't want
to say about yourself.
- The only thing I'm really
nervous about
on this challenge is,
I can't stand Sharon,
and that probably won't change.
- Do you want to call me
post-mortem glam
or Party City spook?
- I think
Party City spook is good,
'cause I don't want
to call you glamorous.
- I wouldn't consider
Phi Phi a frenemy.
I'd consider her an enemy.
- And that's it.
Shit.
- This challenge is so tough
because we basically have
to create a nightclub act,
and we're singing it live.
- Neither Dida nor myself sing,
and it was hard.
- We sound like two sick cats.
- I've been waiting
for this challenge,
because I love to sing, I've
been singing since I was little,
so we'll see how this goes.
- Hot mess.
Oh, my God. What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi, Ru.
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz.
So what's your plan?
- Well, our plan
is a classic sister act,
truly reading each other down
the Runway.
- Listen, there are
two other teams,
and you've got to have something
that's gonna stand out.
Dida, what do you think that
Chad has that you don't have?
- I have a bit more
of a kind of younger,
around the way
type of look with my drag.
- Chad, what about you?
What do you think that Dida has
that you don't?
- She's not afraid to,
you know,
fall on her face or to fail.
- I want to be surprised.
I want to be entertained.
Trust me,
they're coming for you.
- Thanks, RuPaul.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Sharon Needles,
Phi Phi O'Hara, how's it going?
- I've been working
with my frenemy.
I guess it's going okay.
- Why do you think you two
were paired up?
- We kind of hate each other.
- Really?
A lot of co-stars don't
particularly like each other,
but somehow it creates
a sort of chemistry on-screen
that actually works.
Are either of you singers?
- I am.
- Yeah, we both
are kind of singers.
- Wow. All right, so do
a little preview act for me.
Okay. Ready?
- All right, so,
you want to do--
do you want to put our
choreography with it as well?
- Let's sing it right now.
- Okay, okay,
we'll just sing it,
'cause choreography,
we're working on real hard.
- Okay.
- I'm white, girl.
- Oh, dear.
- Ready? Here we go.
- Uh-huh.
- [off-key shouting]
- [off-key shouting]
- Wow, was that harmony there?
There's a lot of stuff
going on there.
- Sharon really wants to do
this, like, heavy metal voice,
and I'm like,
oh, hell no.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Okay, thank you.
- Good, can't wait to show you.
I know I'm gonna do a good job.
Sharon better not fuck it up,
'cause I'm gonna be pissed.
- Willam and Latrice.
- Hello.
- Do either of you sing
in your acts?
- I regularly do.
Most of my act
is with a live band.
- Now, Latrice,
what do you think Willam has
that you don't have?
- When I first met
little Willam,
I was not featuring
her at all, right?
She was not the feature
presentation.
But I'm a quiet confident, where
she's very vocal about it.
- What does Latrice have
that you don't have?
- I would love to have
some of that quiet confidence
instead of my confidence
that some people mistake
for cockiness.
- I'm gonna help ground
Willam a little bit more.
We're gonna calm her down.
Pss-pss, pss-pss.
- Yeah.
- Let your work
speak for itself.
- So what is the gimmick
for your outfits?
- We're gonna be pretty in pink.
[laughs]
- Oh, pretty in pink.
Is that enough of a gimmick?
- Oh, I'm gonna turn her out.
- Oh, yeah?
- Basically,
she's gonna be a whore.
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
- Okeydoke.
- All right, wonderful.
- Fuck it, let's just do what
we want to do and do it well.
- [groans]
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
Later today, you'll have
a chance to work on your acts
with the composer
of<i> Better Than You,</i>
my songwriting partner
and producer Lucian Piane.
- Very cool.
- And tomorrow
on the main stage,
you'll be making your
NYX cosmetics nightclub debut
in front of our
extra-special guest judges,
the wonderful actress and
poker champion Jennifer Tilly.
- [gasps]
- Wow!
- I love Jennifer Tilly!
- Academy award nominee
Jennifer Tilly.
It doesn't get better than that.
- And the always fabulous
Pamela Anderson will be here.
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
[laughter]
- Honey, I grew up watching
Pamela Anderson.
She's sickening.
She's the blond bombshell.
- And you'll be judged
as a team.
That means one pair
will be the winner
and one pair will have
to lip-sync for their lives.
- Why?
RuPaul, why are you
doing this to us?
- All right, frenemies.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- This is crazy.
The first time in history
we all have to lip-sync
against each other.
Like, that could be
an emotional lip-sync.
What do you guys think
about, like,
having to lip-sync against
your teammate?
- Uh, well, that's a wrench
in the program, but--
- I'm not making plans to do it.
- [laughs]
- If Willam and Latrice
get in the bottom together,
bye, Willam.
- Honey, 'cause Latrice
know how to buck.
- Girl, Latrice
is gonna wear her out.
- Phi Phi's rolling her eyes
and talking about me,
and everybody's
saying I suck,
but they can fuck themselves.
I mean, Phi Phi--
I feel like in her eyes
I'm only as good
as my last performance,
and she thinks I'm just,
like, worthless now.
- Well, what was her
last performance?
- She's never done anything.
- No.
- Her's seems to be
a lot of the,
"Up here, dumb character!"
Voice, voice voice!
That's all I'm seeing
right now.
- Our accessories
sell our dresses.
You know, we'll have halos
and devil horns, devil tail.
- Yeah. It just has to look
really showgirl-y.
- You know, Phi Phi just wants
things so "perfect."
And then they'll say,
"Ooh, your tutu's legs."
- The only thing with
a minidress I'm scared about
is that it's gonna rise up.
- Well, we don't do anything
upside down.
- I'm not gonna go on-stage
and get read
for having my panties show.
Like, that's why.
Sharon's look is never polished.
I just don't feel like her drag
should be even critiqued
side-by-side with mine.
This is stressing me out.
- Hi, I'm Willam.
- Latrice.
How are you?
- Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Lucian.
- Lucian is RuPaul's producer.
Like, he's the man
behind the magic.
- So are you guys ready
to perform for me,
and then we'll
take it from there?
- Sure.
- We'll come out to here,
do the first lines.
We'll move on to the whole show,
and then on the,
"I'm so much better than,"
we'll start walking.
- Oh, I thought--
- You walk in with me.
What, what?
- Yeah, I thought we were gonna
do our lines as we walk.
- Oh, okay, that's even--
- 'Cause that--yeah.
- That's fine.
- I think that's better.
- Okay.
- Are you guys ready?
- We're ready.
- Cue playback.
- All right, make sure you say,
"I'm a legendary," and then--
- I'm a legendary.
- Yeah, just make it clear
that you're being interrupted.
- Okay, got you.
- Wait.
It's every man for themselves.
If Latrice misses a line,
I'm gonna steamroll through it
with my next line.
- To be late is to be left.
- Boom.
Yeah.
- I would just say, like,
the more, like, vindictive
you can be with each other--
- Oh, well,
we've got that going.
- Yeah, you almost had it.
I don't know what happened
right there.
- Can we do it again
from the top, please?
- Willam is scrambling,
and she's not in
the right head space.
If either one of us screws up,
we're both screwed.
- Do you have any notes for us,
like, other than--
- Yeah, you guys just have
to practice and practice.
- Thanks.
I know that, in his head,
Lucian is reading.
He's like, these bitches are
fucking my song up right now.
- A little rough
on some of the cues there.
If you don't get
the lines across
and you guys are just doing
physical comedy,
it'll be like, why did she
fall down on the stage?
Or why did this happen?
Really concentrate on the lyrics
and getting those down,
and then, like, have fun.
- There's a certain level
of expectation for me
because I've been in
the business for 20 years.
I don't want to look like an
idiot in front of America.
- Cue playback.
- Wait.
Ready?
- Chad and Dida seemed
a little less prepared.
They struggled a little bit
with the timing of the lyrics.
- Okay, okay.
In a performance like this,
you guys have really
got to, like, step it up.
- The stress point of
the rehearsal was vocalization.
You throw the choreography
in there with it,
it's getting a little hairy.
- We have a little work
to do here.
- Yeah, we need a little work.
Um, uh, I'm a--
I guess I'm a little confused
by the opera stuff.
- 'Cause I'm an angel,
and I want to do, like,
a Disney character type of look.
- And I'm a devil.
I'm supposed to scream one of
my, "I do it so much better."
- Okay.
- Like...
I do it so much better!
- Yeah, we'll see.
- And then back to our normal.
- Oh, okay. Okay.
But why don't we Run it again,
and you--you guys--
- Could we just sing--
just do it normal
with no gimmicks
or anything right now?
- Okay, okay.
I feel like you guys
are just trying to sing this
a little too much.
The vocals are upstaging
the lyrics.
You don't have to do the vocal
stuff a little bit.
- Don't Christina it out.
- Bitch, shut up.
That's fine.
We'll talk it.
- Let's just, like, go,
uh, through the end part.
- Fucking shit!
- Let's try that again.
- [groans]
Fucking shit!
Sharon has no rhythm,
and if our rhythm is off,
then the music's off,
and then our beats are off,
and then it's just
all gonna be off,
and I'm not gonna be
in the bottom two
because Sharon is off.
- It doesn't even
fully seem like
you're totally present
right now.
I don't even know what that is.
- There'll always be tension
between me and Phi Phi.
She's that squeaky princess
that just needs to be
whapped over the head
with a two-by-four.
- You guys have to bring
your A game.
- Down the rabbit hole, darling.
- No, you don't.
- It is showtime,
ladies and gentlemen!
We have to perform duets.
Not lip-syncing.
Not recorded in a studio.
Live, bitches.
- Do you notice that Willam
is low energy today?
- She seems really quiet, girl.
- Usually Willam
has these one-liners
that she just shoots out
and throws,
but she's not speaking
to anyone and...
she just doesn't
seem like herself.
- How are you feeling today?
You all right?
- What?
- You know, you feelin' okay?
- Um, yeah.
It has nothing to do with this.
- Nothin'?
I'm a little worried because
we're being judged as a couple.
This definitely could
affect our performance.
I think you seem really
distracted today.
- No, I'm not.
I'm fine.
Once--once the red light's on,
I'm there.
- Okay, all right.
- Don't worry.
- [clears throat]
- Wait, what?
- [laughs]
- I'm glad I wore double
deodorant today.
I'm just gonna
ham it up onstage.
When Ru says, "You guys are
the winner of this challenge"--
- I'll like you permanently
if we win this together.
- Yeah, we fumbled yesterday
on the Runway,
but we understand that this
is an important challenge,
so put all differences aside.
Let's win this challenge.
Oh, my god,
you're a showgirl now.
- Oh, my--
- You're like me!
- Phi Phi and Sharon,
surprisingly, are getting along.
Is this for real?
- Sharon is a showgirl!
- I'm just temporarily playing
the role of a Phi Phi.
I'm getting to like Phi Phi
a little more,
but now it's just
upgraded to hate.
[clatter]
- Who is slamming the fucking
counter while I'm doing liquid?
- Girl, the counter moves.
- No, someone just slammed
something shut twice.
- Well, everyone tiptoe
around Willam's liquid.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I miss my drag family
now so bad.
I work with
some of the weirdest,
most interesting performers,
I think, in America.
If we're not freaking 'em out,
we're not working it out.
That is just the name of the
game in the house of haunt.
- If we go too long without
seeing and talking
with each other,
we have a potluck dinner
at my house and everybody
comes over for drinks.
- I want to come over
to dinner at your house.
- Me too, bitch.
- Absolutely.
'Cause we cook
the house down, honey.
- I always thought
I was so fucking interesting
before I came here but, like,
your guys' lives sound
like so much more fun.
I haven't come
from a drag family
because I didn't come up
through the club system
like most people have.
I've been on TV most of my life
for the past ten years.
I am a little weak in the friend
department because of it.
- I can't believe
you don't have,
like, a strong drag family.
- No.
- I need them.
- I couldn't live without them.
- [laughs]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, baby.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's my evil twin,
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, and a big
domo arigato to you.
- [laughs]
Lucian Piane,
my partner in crime.
- Hey, it's so good to see you.
- How are my girls?
- They're really amazing.
- Did you sleep
with any of them?
- Two of them.
- [laughs]
Jennifer Tilly.
You're looking
beautiful tonight.
- Well, thank you.
The monkey glands are working.
- [laughs]
And Pamela Anderson.
Hey, soul sister.
- I finally made it.
Thanks for having me.
You look gorgeous.
- This old thing.
- [laughs]
- This week,
the queens were challenged
to perform a duet
with their best frenemies.
Tonight, on the main stage,
they're gonna make their
live nightclub debut.
Are you ready
for some double trouble?
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Latrice and Willam.
I feel good vibes
coming from this.
- Willam is in it to win it.
I'm in it to win it.
Let's do this damn thing.
- [laughs]
[laughter]
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- All the jokes land,
but any chance to be onstage
is a chance to shine.
- Whoo!
- [laughs]
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles.
- I think she added
a teaspoon or two
of Christina "Agliera,"
but that's another matter.
- I could tell that the judges
looked a little bored.
I'm going to be so pissed if
this cheesy song and dance
number sends me out of here.
- Whoo!
- Chad Michaels, Dida Ritz.
- Hello, Dida, darling.
- Hello, Chad.
How are you?
- I'm a legend.
- Well, that's debatable.
- I never.
I could hear my voice
kind of shaking a little bit.
RuPaul is right in front of you.
Don't fuck it up!
- [gasps]
- But at least my face moves
when I frown.
- Oh! Skag!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Dida, you bitch! Oh!
[laughter]
- Thank you.
- Welcome, ladies.
This week, we asked you
to combine your strengths
and weaknesses to create
one dynamic duo,
so tonight,
you'll be judged as a couple.
First up, Willam
and Latrice Royale.
Tell us about your performance.
- She has definitely gotten me
out of my comfort zone
a little bit.
[laughter]
This is not exactly what
I would do normally,
but absolutely loving
that I'm showcasing
the curves and swerves
I represent for the big girls.
- [laughs]
Do you feel that this outfit
compromises your Christianity?
- Jesus is a biscuit,
and I let him sop me up, so--
- Yes!
[laughter]
- You guys look amazing.
I love the lingerie,
the stockings.
Your shoes are killer.
- Oh, they're Versace.
- And that pratfall.
I'm using that trick.
That was some Vegas shit.
- But sometimes too much shtick
can get in the way.
- You two were sort of
like a Laurel and Hardy
or a Jane Russell/Marilyn Monroe
sort of combination.
You're really different,
but you worked so well together
and I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you, ladies.
- I just have to say one thing.
- What's that?
-<i> America's Got Talent</i>
has nothing on this show.
- Uh, hear, hear.
- This is a great show,
and there's so much talent
on the stage,
it's fun to see.
- Thanks, Pamela.
- Next up, Chad Michaels
and Dida Ritz.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi.
- So, Dida, who did it better?
- Uh...
- Just say it, bitch.
- I will say me.
- That's right.
[laughter]
- What about you, Chad?
- Of course, darling, it was me.
[laughter]
- Sorry.
- I was getting a cavity,
listening to you two.
[laughter]
It was so Roxie and Velma.
It was very<i> Chicago,</i>
which I love.
- Well, I feel a little
like Paula Abdul,
'cause I loved everything.
[laughter]
- Dida, sometimes when you get
really, really excited
and you're singing
and you have so much energy,
you kind of lose
a little bit of the vocals.
- I think the jokes may have
fallen a little flat
because you couldn't hear
what you were saying.
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Phi Phi O'Hara.
How did it feel up there?
- Me and Phi Phi have had
some bad blood here.
I've always found it
kind of hard to be accepted
by glamorous pageant-y queens,
and I took a little bit
of that mindset
into this competition.
- Calling her a pageant queen,
is that a read?
- Sharon, you could learn
something from pageant queens.
You're not losing Sharon Needles
in this glam look.
- I love this hair.
- It's gorgeous on you.
- I should have
done this a long--
this is some country crock hair.
- I think you guys were great,
and you look a little Janice
Dickinson and you're me.
- That's what I was channeling.
- I loved it.
- When you came down
to the bottom of the stage,
I loved that you were
trying the harmonies,
but they're a little bit off.
- I do feel like the comedy
was underplayed.
I think you guys
should have been funnier.
- Y'all were almost too nice.
It's a frenemies type of thing.
You know, it's kind of like, uh,
you're cutting on each other.
It was hard to even hear
if there was any shade in there.
- Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls...
- [sighs]
- What do you think?
Willam and Latrice Royale.
- Latrice stepped out
of her comfort zone,
and it looked great.
Vocally, I thought Willam
could really sing.
I did love their shtick
that they did,
but it kind of
took over the song.
- A little less might have been
a little bit more in this case.
- Well, I thought that their act
was very polished.
I really liked the choreography.
I thought it was very smooth
and it was very worked out.
- Now, would you have them open
for you in Vegas?
- Yes!
Especially with that little--
that thing at the end,
when they threw the purse
and she tripped or whatever.
- Yeah, that was good.
- The pratfall was great.
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz,
the ingenue and the veteran.
- The duo felt a little lopsided
with Dida's energy
being over the top.
- She was so energized,
and that's a great thing,
but that can also be
detrimental sometimes.
The microphone was a bit close,
like she gonna swallow it.
- Now, is that a bad thing?
- [laughs]
Not normally.
- All right, let's move on
to Sharon Needles
and Phi Phi O'Hara,
the devil and the angel.
- They started with the
harmonies, and I was like,
oh, my God, I'm so impressed.
They're singing in harmo--uh-oh.
Oh.
[laughter]
- I loved their voices together,
but then, I'm tone deaf.
[laughter]
And I thought there
could have been used
a little more choreography
at the beginning,
but I have no rhythm, so--
- Oh!
[laughs]
- Yesterday, there was some
undercurrent of tension
between them and then, today,
they seemed like
they had their shtick together.
They knew exactly what they were
doing, but unfortunately,
their shtick
didn't have a lot of shtick.
- I did like their outfits.
I thought that the angel
and devil thing was a good idea,
but it didn't really deliver,
because you couldn't even tell
any jabs were being thrown.
- All right.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your frenemies
nightclub act
and your presentations
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Now, you are all troupers,
but tonight,
one duo did it so much better.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
Willam and Latrice Royale.
[applause]
You each win a custom corset
skirt and brassiere
of versatilecorsets.Com.
- I didn't expect to win
this challenge.
I'm really glad I didn't let
my partner down.
It's pretty fucking cool.
- That leaves Chad and Dida,
and Phi Phi and Sharon.
- [groans]
- Ladies, it's come to
a point in the competition
where every decision
is a painful one.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles...
- [vomiting]
I feel kind of, like,
gut bubbles,
and I feel really sick.
I didn't want
to make RuPaul wait.
I didn't want to make
any of the guest judges wait.
I'm sorry.
So I tried to throw up
off the stage.
- It's really not cute.
- Willam, are you okay
to continue?
All right.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles,
you are up for elimination.
Chad Michaels, Dida Ritz,
you may join the other girls.
- I was nice to Sharon,
and it backfired.
You know what?
I'm done.
I'm not playing nice
with you anymore.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
- I don't want to go home,
plain and simple.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
<i>- This is RuPaul.</i>
<i>- And this is Martha Wash.</i>
<i>- We are reporting</i>
<i>to you live...</i>
<i>- From our weather center.</i>
<i>Honey, just when</i>
<i>you thought it was safe</i>
<i>to go back outside...</i>
<i>both: Bam, the sequel!</i>
- Hey!
- Oh, crap.
My wig was hanging on
by one freakin' bobby pin.
I'm not keeping
that bitch on my head.
It might as well go.
It's in my way.
<i>- That's right, honey.</i>
- I've worked too hard
and I've gone too far
into this competition,
and I'm not gonna get kicked off
because of some showgirl
Barbie doll.
- I know how Phi Phi
dances and performs.
I was shocked to see
that Sharon is keeping up.
This is tough to watch,
because you don't know
who is gonna go home.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.
- I'm very fucking nervous.
It was my first time
having my fate
dangled in front of my face.
- Willam, will you please
step forward.
- What the hell is happening?
- Willam, you won tonight
because you are a beautiful
and talented queen,
but it has come to my attention
that you have broken the Rules--
Rules that are in place
to protect the fairness
of this competition.
Your actions have consequences,
and I'm afraid
you leave me no choice.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Now, sashay away.
- I broke the Rules,
but I'm a big boy
dressed in big girl's clothes,
so regret's kind of like
a fool's game.
I can't change anything
that I did,
and there's no use spending
any time dwelling on it.
I stood on stage, sick,
with a 24-inch-waist,
and I'm proud of myself.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles,
in light of tonight's events,
you got lucky.
You are both safe.
Shante, you stay.
[applause]
You may join the other girls.
My fierce five, let this
be a warning to all of you,
in the race to become
America's next drag superstar,
sometimes a queen's worst enemy
can be herself.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll be competing as
a couple...of frenemies.
Shit.
I'm not gonna be in the bottom
two because Sharon is off.
- Oh!
- [laughing]
- Ow!
Dida, you bitch!
- Thank you.
- Condragulations,
Willam and Latrice Royale.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles,
you are up for elimination.
Ladies, it's come to a point
in the competition
where every decision
is a painful one.
Willam, it has come
to my attention
that you have broken the rules.
Your actions have consequences.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Sashay away.
And tonight...
the queens
hit the campaign trail...
It's time to make
some "herstory"...
And "Frock the Vote".
- I'm gonna fit the capitol
with an up-do.
Up...do.
- With extra-special
guest judges,
columnist Dan savage
and Absolut's Jeffrey Moran.
- [cheering]
- The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour
featuring Absolut Vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- Ohh.
Cluck, cluck, top five.
- Top five, bitches, top five.
- Good morning.
- It's a good day,
because Willam is gone,<i> </i>
<i>finally</i><span style="bodyStyle"> gone,</i>
and I'm so excited.
- What is that?
- "I showed my ass a lot,
so here's one for the road."
- That is her ass.
- Ewww!
- That's nasty.
She showed that she was an ass.
- Yeah.
Willam broke the rules,
so bye, boo, bye.
- Good-bye, shady bearded lady!
- [cheering]
- Whoo!
Good-bye, shady bearded lady.
- Y'all are crazy.
- Fuck that bitch.
- I feel bad for Willam.
It's a really bummer
the way it ended for him.
- All right, Willam.
I mean, this is the only advice
I can give you
in your drag career.
[all laughing]
- Shave it.
- Shave your face!
- I got to admit, though,
I'm kind of jealous.
There's nothing more punk rock
than being kicked off.
- No, bitch.
No, no, no.
Not off<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
bitch.
That was the walk of shame,
bitch.
- Yeah.
- No shade, no tea, you guys.
Like, seriously, could you
believe that shit happened?
For once in my life,
I'm speechless.
No one's ever been kicked off
in the history of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I'm gagged.
- When RuPaul came out,
it was like this.
- Hold on, hold on,
we can do this.
I'll be Willam, you be Ru.
All right, I'll be Willam.
- [laughing]
- [imitating RuPaul]
I've consulted with the judges.
- Blech!
- But the final decision
is up to me.
- Blech!
- [all laughing]
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles,
you're both safe.
Sharon, you were better,
but you're both safe.
- Blech!
- [all laughing]
- You are fucking evil.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
- Speak of the devil.
- You've got shemail.
Attention all teabaggers.
- Uh!
- Read my lips.
According to a recent
stripper poll,
America's next drag superstar
needs to pull herself up
by her bra straps,
stand tall in her platforms,
and be the life of every party.
'Cause honey,
nobody likes an empty box.
- No, ma'am.
- I'm RuPaul, and I don't
approve this message.
[engine zooms]
- Stripper poll?
- Hello, hello, hello!
- [all greeting]
- Ladies, America's
next drag superstar
has to stand for something,
or she'll fall for anything.
Now, for today's mini-challenge,
you need to stand tall
by decorating a pair
of platform shoes.
Take them from plain to par-tay.
To provide you
with some inspiration,
please help me welcome
Absolut Vodka guru
Jeffrey Moran.
[clapping]
- Hey, Ru.
Gentlemen.
What you see here before you
are some great classic cocktails
that will be the inspiration
for today's challenge.
At Absolut,
we've been celebrating
the gay and lesbian community
for 30-plus years.
So you can imagine we've thrown
some really great parties.
- Dida Ritz, your inspiration
is an Absolut Collins.
Latrice Royale, Absolut Punch.
Phi Phi O'Hara,
Absolut Grapevine.
Sharon Needles,
Absolut Berri Sour.
Chad Michaels,
Absolut Greyhound.
- Love it. Thank you.
- Okay, ladies,
you'll have 20 minutes
to create platforms that look
good enough to drink.
Ready, set...
go.
- You got the good stuff.
- You don't even know
what you're talking about.
- Oh, man, this is not sticking.
- Jiggly, quit
complaining over there.
- [scoffs]
Needles.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck
does it look like I'm doing?
- How's it going for you?
- Oh, fine.
I had all the accessories
I needed
to convey the plight
of the American Indians.
Though I wish I had
some poker chips.
- Ow!
- All right, ladies, time's up.
Let's see your platforms.
First up, Dida Ritz.
- I was inspired by the
Victorian age,
so I took from Marie Antoinette,
and she's a big woman
on shopping and shoes.
She would want a fierce pair
of shoes like this.
- Sort of if Marie Antoinette
were a stripper.
- She would wear these.
I know she would.
- Latrice Royale.
Absolut Punch platforms.
- Well, my shoes are inspired
by the nightclub.
That's where everybody's
getting their party on
and their drink on.
And you might see a girl
hanging from the ceiling,
wearing these shoes.
- Oh.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
Absolut Grapevine platforms.
- You know I'm designing for
your new iron fist line, right?
- Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah.
I really wanted to take you to,
like, an exotic
vacation hot spot.
Like for all those, you know,
women that are at home,
they can just put on their shoes
and have a cocktail,
and bam, they're on vacation.
- [chuckles]
All right, next up,
Sharon Needles.
- My Berri Sour platforms
are inspired by red rocks
of the southwestern America,
and I'm serving you
some Navajo realness.
And we have these
dream catchers in the back.
I prefer nightmare catchers,
but these do the trick.
- These are platform shoes
for the real "nava-hos".
- [cackling]
- I thought we were
supposed to design a shoe,
not just slab on a piece of fur.
- May I see
the dessert platter next?
- Um, yes.
Let me get you a dessert.
Are you guys good on coffee?
- Good on coffee right now.
- Good on coffee? Yeah.
- Everything tasting all right?
- Yeah.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- This is for the girl on the go
on New Year's Eve to wear,
and she's got her Greyhound
in the foot to go.
- Oh, now, what makes that
Greyhound in the foot?
- That's grapefruit juice.
- Of course. Okay.
- Absolutely.
Need a little vitamin C.
You don't want scurvy, you know.
- No, no, not again.
I'll never go
through that again.
- [chuckles]
- Ladies, you all stepped it up,
but one of you really walked
all over the competition.
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Yeah! Hot dog.
- Condragulations, Phi Phi.
I am head over heels
for those shoes right there.
And thank you, Jeffrey Moran.
- Of course, anytime.
- We will see you tomorrow
on the main stage.
- Look forward to it.
Good luck.
- Bye. Thank you.
- Speaking of platforms,
I want to find out
what America's
next drag superstar
really stands for.
And this being an election year,
it's time to make
some "herstory".
I, RuPaul,
would like to announce
the candidacy
of Phi Phi O'Hara, Dida Ritz,
Sharon Needles, Latrice Royale,
and Chad Michaels
to become the first
drag president
of the United States of America.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll face the nation
in a "Frock the Vote"
presidential debate.
This is your chance to prove
that you have the kind of
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent it takes to be
the leader of the free world.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...win.
- To prepare for the debate,
we have to do
an opening statement,
a closing statement.
We have to get in drag.
We have to come up with slogans.
So there's a lot
involved in this challenge.
- [snickers]
- I'm gonna get in trouble.
- Put her away.
- [laughing] What?
- Put her away.
- No way. Why would I?
- Why would you?
- I'm bringing back
the funk to America, honey.
I decided to do a
non-traditional character
and do something
a little bit edgier,
a little bit more dangerous,
take a risk.
How you doing?
- Two pink afros on a brown wig.
For him to pull that piece of
crap out and put it on his head,
like, for a presidential debate.
- I'm gonna give you lady pimp.
- For today's main challenge,
we're running for president...
in drag.
- It's like we're back in
school.
So...
The workroom is insanely quiet
right now.
And, like, everybody is just
thinking so hard
about their stuff,
and I'm just having a good time.
[belching]
[still belching]
[sighs loudly]
- I'm having the worst
brain fart right now.
- [belching]
[still belching]
Excuse me.
- I'm so confused.
[laughs]
This challenge is so tough.
I'm just struggling
with coming up with ideas.
Politics is not my comfort zone.
- I get it.
- I'm done.
- Work.
- Girl.
- Whew.
- You better come for it,
miss Phi Phi.
- I feel confident
in this challenge
because I always like to argue.
Y'all didn't take
debate classes in school?
- Uh-uh.
- I did.
I wanted to be a lawyer
when I was younger.
- That's why you're so
confrontational all the time.
- I just have to be right.
- Even when you're wrong.
- Bitch, I'm never wrong.
- You're wrong right now.
- Learn it.
- Are you writing answers
to your questions already?
- Yeah, aren't you done?
I mean, I took debate, like,
for seven, eight years.
- [laughs]
- And I'm a lawyer,
so hurry up and get it done.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, Ru.
- Ladies, I hope you're decent,
because we have company.
Journalist, political pundit,
and founder of the
It Gets Better Project,
Dan Savage.
- [contestants cheer]
- Awesome.
- Hello, candidates.
- Now, Dan's here to help you
prep for the big debate
and serve up
some political realness.
Hey, Latrice.
- Hey, Ru. How are you?
- Have you come up
with a campaign slogan?
- Of course.
"Everyone needs
a piece of Latrice."
- What about
"Peace with Latrice"?
- Ooh, that's very good.
So what is your platform?
- Well, I want more funding
for HIV and AIDS patients
who are on disability.
- But voters right now
are gonna ask you,
okay, if you're gonna make more
money available for that,
what are you gonna cut?
- Right.
- Oh, something gotta go?
- Yeah.
Like the wars.
- The war, yeah.
Politics, for real, for real.
This is not easy.
- Now, it's important
that you get your message across
and that you're not vague.
It has to be direct.
- Right.
- All right, Latrice,
we're gonna let you
get back to your campaign,
all right?
- Thank you.
- Break a lash.
- I will.
- Hi, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Ru.
- You're running for president?
- I am.
- What's your slogan?
- Um, "you can always Kiki
with your girl Phi Phi."
- You're offering to have sex
with all Americans?
- [laughs]
- Not Kai-Kai.
- Oh, okay, I'm confused.
- Kiki, yeah.
- Kiki means, like, you know,
like, we gossip with each other.
- Oh, okay.
- It rhymes with my name,
and it's easy to remember.
- But it's easy to
misunderstand, like I did.
So you might want to have
a couple of alternates.
- So what is your platform?
- Make America pretty.
You know, build warehouses, so
that way a bunch of drag queens
can make designer
human hair wigs.
- So you're providing jobs
or you're providing wigs?
- Both.
- Okay, so it's socialism
for drag queens, then.
The government
will give you your wig.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna be
the drag president, so...
- Listen, you have
to make it something
that really speaks
to every American.
You have to be really direct.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work, okay?
All right, thanks, Phi Phi.
Hi, Dida.
- Hi, Ru.
- You doing your homework?
- I'm trying.
- Now, it's important to know
what you stand for.
What is your platform?
My platform is really about--
for like, queens
who are kind of underpaid.
We are stars too,
and this is a job,
and it deserves the same respect
as any normal performer.
- Why should someone
who's not a drag queen
vote for you for president?
- That I haven't come up with.
I still have
some thinking to do.
- Do you vote, personally?
- I do, I do, I vote.
I just--politics
is kind of something
that's hard for me to discuss
because it can get personal.
It can get very ugly,
and I hate that, so--
- Which is why it's important
for us to pay attention,
because politicians are gonna
demonize sexual minorities.
And if they can count on us
checking out,
they're likelier to win
and then get into office,
where they can really
do us harm.
- Right.
Well, you just read me.
I'm not gonna lie.
- Just make sure that it really
comes from the heart.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- He lit my complete
campaign on fire.
That's what Dan Savage did.
I feel fucked.
- Candidate Chad Michaels.
- Hey, RuPaul.
- I want to hear
all about the campaign.
- Well, I'm just gonna have
some fun, Ru.
- Yes?
- So I'm creating a crazy lady.
- Oh, boy.
- For my campaign, and her name
is Lady Pimp Michaels.
- So what are your
campaign slogans?
- My issues are mandatory rhythm
and funk lessons
for all school kids,
because we've really lost
the beat in this country.
- Are there any real issues
you want to inject?
Do you have a real issue?
- I haven't really put
any real issues into this.
'Cause I want to make this fun.
- Make sure the constituency
can relate to you.
- I get you.
- Which is gonna be a problem
if that's your outfit.
- That's a pantsuit.
What are you talking about?
- All right, thanks, Chad.
- Bye, guys.
- Sharon Needles,
the first drag president.
What campaign slogans
have you written?
- Um, some of my campaign
slogans are,
"America's government
needs a sex change."
- Well, what does that mean?
- Well, it means, you know,
that it's time that, you know,
not just a man or a woman
is in office, but a man-woman--
- Oh.
- You know, is in the office.
Someone who can play
both fields.
- Now, are you planning
any negative campaigning?
- I'm not going to create
negative attack ad campaigns
because I was bullied
my entire childhood,
and that's just not
the platform I'm going to be,
uh, working with.
I want to talk to the people.
- But everybody says that
till they're down in the polls.
- Well, I enjoy being down
on a poll, so...
I mean, that's just something
I can handle, I think.
- Okay, good for you.
- I know you have
a lot of work to do,
so I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
See you at the debate.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
All right, ladies.
Remember, these are tough times.
And the future of this great
nation depends on you.
So don't fuck it up.
Let's go.
- Good evening, and welcome
to "Frock the Vote" 2012.
Give us 22 minutes,
and we'll give you an erection
for the election.
I am your moderator, RuPaul.
And I'm here
with my esteemed colleagues
Michelle Visage and Dan Savage.
Welcome, candidates.
Tonight your answers
will be timed.
The yellow light
is a ten-second warning.
The red light
means your time is up.
If you go over,
the secret service is here
to escort you from the building.
Let's kick things off
with opening statements.
Chad Michaels.
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Chad
the Lady Pimp Michaels.
I am from California,
more specifically
the Shady Acres trailer park
on Doheny between
Weho and Beverly hills.
You might also remember me
as one of the first
transgendered dancers
on the<i> Soul Train.</i>
How you doin'?
[buzzer sounds]
What I plan to do is--
- Time is up, miss Michaels.
- The red light?
Shoes.
- Dida Ritz, same question.
- I am here,
and my name is Dida Ritz.
I'm here representing--or
running for wig party candidate.
And I'm here to talk
about the big "C" word today.
Change.
Change for the Ritz.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Howdy, y'all.
I'm just a small
southern girl from Texas.
You can see me
on the bestseller's list,
<i>Vote for Phi Phi.</i>
I just want everybody to know
that you can always Kiki
with your girl Phi Phi.
- Sharon Needles.
- Ladies and gentlemen
and everyone in between,
my name is Sharon Needles.
For a long time,
this government has been
in dire need of a sex change,
and I'm just the drag queen
to perform that operation.
I'm Sharon Needles,
for sharing responsibilities.
- Latrice Royale.
- Good evening.
I am Latrice Royale.
Large and in charge,
chunky yet funky.
My fellow Americans,
everyone needs peace
with Latrice.
- All right, candidates.
The first question of the
evening from Dan Savage.
- Miss O'Hara, what experiences
from your past
make you the best candidate
to be America's first
drag president?
- Well, I have
lots of friends already,
like, in the government thing.
Ooh, like Sarah Palin.
And--and, like, when we used to
play "Spot That Russian!"
across the room,
like, my backyard or--
or when I was in Texas, we used
to go cow-tipping in drag.
- Oh.
[inaudible]
I'm scared for her.
- Yee-ha.
- Miss Royale?
- Coming from hum--
humble beginnings,
I was raised as a poor
black child in Compton.
I know what hard work,
dedication,
and perseverance means.
- All right, our next question,
from Michelle Visage.
- Miss Michaels,
as the first drag president,
how would you
redecorate the White House?
- I'm gonna paint
that bitch pink,
and I'm gonna fit the capitol
with an up-do.
Up...do.
Green light, look.
Yellow.
Bam, red.
[buzzer sounds]
- Chad has this, like,
master pimp thing going on.
I don't understand,
like, his storyline.
I mean, in a debate,
what is he debating about?
- [smacks lips]
- Dida Ritz.
- Well, first, I see everything
being Ralph Lauren.
I'm a big fan of Ralph Lauren
furniture,
Ralph Lauren paint,
Ralph Lauren rugs.
The drapery, Ralph Lauren.
- Girl, really?
- I would love
Ralph Lauren everything.
Thank you.
- Miss O'Hara.
- Hi.
- If you won the wig party
nomination,
which one of these queens
would you choose
as your running mate, and why?
- Well, being this time period,
I think it's so great
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.
So I'd definitely like
to say my help, Dida Ritz,
and the other help I had,
Latrice Royale.
[laughs brightly]
Yee-ha.
- Did she just call me
"the help"?
I don't even do windows.
- I'm from Compton, bitch.
I'll whip yo' ass.
- Miss Ritz, should drag queens
be allowed to marry?
- I truly believe drag queens
should be allowed
to get married,
whether a drag queen
wants to marry a drag queen
or a drag queen
wants to marry a dog.
Change for the Ritz.
- Sharon Needles.
- Drag queens should most
definitely
be able to get married.
They should also have the right
to get divorced.
I too would like to be
an unhappy married woman
and then receive
my alimony checks
to pay for my young lovers
and vacations.
Thank you, Dan.
- Our next question
from Michelle Visage.
- Miss Michaels,
How would you explain
why drag is important
to voters who aren't
familiar with drag?
- Me being the first
transgendered<i> Soul Train</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dancer,</i>
we need to get back
to basic family values.
We've forgotten all of our
pertinent dance moves.
We got to get back
to the sprinkler.
All right?
We got to get back
to the running man.
Oh, wait--
- That was the Roger Rabbit.
- That's the Roger Rabbit.
- Yeah.
- Look, I don't got nothing
to say about it,
I just--we did what we had to do
to, you know, to get by.
Look, yellow...
red.
- Miss Ritz,
unemployment is up,
higher than it's
ever been before.
How do you plan to put
more drag queens to work?
- Basically, to give them
more opportunities
to do what they love to do
by performing.
And no more of this $75 or $100
of bookings.
Queens deserve coins.
Drag costs montey.
It costs money to look,
well, this beautiful.
Thank you.
- Miss Royale,
politics can get so ugly.
Can you give us an example
of a time when you made peace
with someone you didn't
see eye to eye with?
- About five minutes ago.
I looked across at Miss O'Hara
and realized that she was ugly.
- Oh.
- And I'm at peace with that.
- [snickers]
- [laughing quietly]
- Miss O'Hara.
- Oh, howdy.
- How do you represent
the future of drag
in the U.S. of "Heyyy!"
- Well, first,
it's U.S. of "How-day!"
[laughs]
So I'm representing all, like,
the little southern girls
that like to warsh our drag,
like,
and hang 'em up to dry.
Oh, and then when we get,
like, our jewelry
and we like to polish rocks
and make beautiful jewelry
'cause remember, if you ain't
got that bling bling,
you probably didn't get it
from Phi Phi.
[laughs]
- You okay?
- Oh, I'm doing line dancing.
- All right, it's time to hear
the candidates'
closing statements.
Let's begin
with Miss Chad Michaels.
- At the end of the day,
I just want, you know,
to put someone down in my chair,
give them a good,
good scalp massage,
send them out,
and make them feel
like an American citizen.
Look, yellow.
One more time.
Red.
Those freaking lights.
Yellow, red.
- Miss Dida Ritz.
- I must say that I have a lot.
I have a lot
that I want to change.
Change for Ritz.
That's my slogan.
Thank you.
- Dida is coming off--like, her
answers are very "who cares?"
There's no passion,
no fire, no nothing.
- Latrice Royale.
- With my plans in effect,
we can look forward
to a fun-loving America,
an America where everyone
could be queen for a day.
Thank you.
- Candidate Sharon Needles.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not a ivy-league,
good old ladyboy.
I'm just a girl of the streets.
And that's where I learned
the American people.
From the dark black soil of Iowa
to the punk rockers
of Colorado...
<i>[My Country 'Tis of Thee</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
To the hippies of southern
California
to the blue-collar boys
of Pittsburgh,
I've walked in every single one
of their shoes.
I am of the people
and for the people.
I am Sharon Needles,
sharing responsibilities
for a better world.
- Miss Phi Phi O'Hara.
This evening,
you get the last word.
- I wanna live in a world
that--vote for Phi Phi--
that--that, you know,
hos can be pimps finally and--
vote for Phi Phi--
and I just want to say--
vote for Phi Phi--
where, you know,
Jesus loves you.
And I didn't have a big enough
heart to cover you.
But I just want to say, America,
don't be a drag.
Yeah.
Oh, I mean be a drag.
Ha, ha, ha!
Howdy.
I won.
- I did find Phi Phi
annoying tonight.
You gotta know when to quit.
[snorts]
[sniffs]
- Oh.
- Thank you, candidates.
That concludes our
"Frock the Vote" debate.
Remember to come early
on election day.
Oh, and don't forget to vote.
Good night, everybody.
- Walk this way.
- Hoo!
- Another day,
another dead diva, honey.
- Yesterday we had
our presidential debate.
And today we have to get ready
for the inaugural ball.
- Don't politics seem
like a drag queen
dressing room nowadays?
- Basically.
It's mudslinging.
It's not cute.
- I mean, I know yesterday
was a drag competition,
but I kind of wish we
could've used it a little more
as a platform
to talk about things that,
you know, we really wish
we could see changed.
- But, you know what?
This is<i> Drag Race,</i>
and it's, like--
- I'm sorry.
That's how I feel like.
I'm not trying to cut you off,
but that is exactly
my frustration.
This is<i> Drag Race.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
This is not the news.
- It's always been my policy,
especially, like,
when I'm working at shows,
you don't mix drag and politics.
I'm out to entertain people
and make them feel good
and not to spread my political
beliefs at the gay bar.
- I mean, the reality
of the fact is,
is Dan Savage is a comedic
political and sex advice writer
who is now taking
responsibility in this world
to try and, you know,
make it better.
I didn't have a Dan Savage
when I was in high school,
and I got it bad.
- Dan Savage
and all he does for, you know,
as an advocate and all that,
it's--it's great.
That's not me...that's Dan.
- We are given an opportunity
that no other drag queen
is given,
and that's a platform
to actually talk about things--
- And I agree with that,
and when I had that platform
to be able to speak,
when I had--
- When I was a kid,
I didn't have a Dan Savage.
- I felt like he trashed me.
Coming in here that serious
about something that was
supposed to be drag-related
and fun at the same time,
mixing views
and important issues
that are going on in the world--
- Right.
- Calm down.
I'm not a really big
fan of politics
because of how ugly it can get.
It doesn't take all that
screaming and hollering
to change the world.
- Did you guys ever run
for anything in school?
- No, I didn't.
- I ran for student council.
- I never did
'cause I didn't want
to really draw
any attention to myself.
I just thought that I would get,
like, harassed more.
- I was the only kid in my
school that,
you know, would say
that I was gay, so...
- Right.
- And, like, I wasn't just gay.
I was, like, gay and weird.
- Right.
- And I got bullied bad,
and I never told my parents
about it.
- I would always tell
the school, and, like,
they would all say, you know,
"Ignore it. Ignore it."
- Kids bully
out of insecurities,
but teachers have
the responsibility to stand in
and help kids
that are getting it.
- I don't know
how things have changed
since I was in high school,
but teachers never really
stepped up to halt anything.
- Well, and as self-serving
as being a drag queen is,
it does feel nice to know that
just having this exposure that
we're having right now--
not to sound cliché, but if I
can just help one child--
- Oh, don't go there.
- Just one.
- [laughing]
- [dramatically] One child,
I've done my part.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
And what?
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
My commander-in-queef,
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, we can,
palm beach princess.
- [chuckling]
And Santino Rice.
How are you?
- I'm good, Ru.
- And our super-delegate
from Absolut, Jeffrey Moran.
- Hello, darling.
- Always good to have you here.
Dan Savage.
Now, is this election
totally leotarded, or what?
- There are some total leotards
running in this election,
but I think
we're gonna be all right.
- This week,
our queens frocked the vote
in a heated presidential debate.
Tonight they're ready
to rock the runway,
dressed for the inaugural ball.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
Call her miss Ross.
Her ballot box is stuffed.
- [laughs]
- It's bedazzled is what it is.
- It sure is.
- I want all eyes on me.
I'm serving them fresh,
young inaugural realness.
- She's got this election
all tied up.
- [laughs]
- Dida Ritz.
In all black.
She's courting the black vote.
- [laughs]
- I'm serving<i> Breakfast at</i>
<i>Tiffany's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> realness.</i>
I feel confident.
I feel so beautiful.
I love my hair, and I love
the color that I went with.
I feel like it is just right.
- President Morticia Addams?
- Ooh, is that a read, Dan?
- Chad Michaels!
- Don't you mean
Lady Bird Michaels?
- Very Marcus Bachmann.
- Ooh.
- In his dreams.
- Yes, in his dreams.
- [laughs]
- I feel like
that Republican lady
that the politician
can take to the ball,
but then take her back home
and she's a whore in bed.
- Very Republican lady.
"Gorge" Bush.
- "Gorge" bush, that's it.
[laughing]
- Latrice Royale.
Working the Beltway.
- Hey.
- You ain't ever
seen a president
look this sexy in your life.
I am throwing it, baby.
I want you to see all this shape
in its full glory.
- Now, that's what I call
a war chest.
- [laughs]
- She went that-a-way.
President Sharon Needles.
- Take me to your leader.
- Yes.
- [laughs]
That's what the Bush twins
wanted to wear
to the inaugural ball.
- I am serving
transparency realness
with a gown made
out of pantyhose
and hair
that hits the debt ceiling.
- I can see
right through her candidacy.
- Yes.
That dress shows off
her stimulus package.
- Welcome, ladies.
We've all watched your debate.
Now it's time for some political
analysis from our judges.
Let's start with Phi Phi O'Hara.
Tell us about
your inaugural gown.
- Well, I decided to wear white.
It's fun. It's elegant.
- Or was it just trying
to court the white people?
- [chuckles]
- Or the help?
- Ooh.
- I think it's so great
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.
- I am clearly all about
political incorrectness,
but in order to land an
off-color joke,
it has to be funny, and that
joke came across as offensive.
And being a black woman,
I got a little offended.
- [laughs]
- People shouldn't get upset.
It's a joke,
'cause that's not me. Like--
- I thought your conservative,
Palinesque character
was really funny,
and I thought you did
a really great job.
You could have even taken it
further for my liking.
- But we all have to be
in on the joke.
It's the fart in church.
Not everyone
thinks that's funny.
It sometimes stinks.
- All right.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.
There was a lot of word salad
going on.
Just a bunch of words tossed up
into the air,
and it wasn't Tina Fey,
Sarah Palin hilarious.
It was just a little mystifying.
- Well, I tried
as hard as I could.
When questions were being asked
to me,
it was just kind of like
a deer in headlights moment.
It kind of makes me
uncomfortable,
to be honest with you.
- It may be uncomfortable
to talk politics, certainly,
but remember,
you're in the running
for America's next
drag superstar.
You exude beauty,
but we also want to know
that you're smart.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
Hi, Chad.
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Tell me about the debate.
- This challenge
was intimidating to me.
Heavy debate and politics
are not my forte,
but I didn't come here
not to rise to the occasion,
so I created
the lady pimp character.
- I loved you in the debate,
and I loved your character.
Every four years,
there are joke candidates.
Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann.
- [laughs]
- And you were
sending those guys up.
You were just stellar.
- You're the only queen tonight
that really looks like you're
going to the inauguration.
- I see Mamie Eisenhower
up there,
and it hearkens back to a time
when the economy
wasn't in the fucking toilet.
- [laughs]
All right, let's move on
to Miss Latrice Royale.
- Hi, Ru.
- What was your platform
and slogan?
- My slogan was, "Everyone
needs peace with Latrice."
And I had a couple of issues,
such as medication
and more funding
for HIV and AIDS patients.
- Did you say that
in the debate?
- I didn't get a chance
to bring it up.
- You say you didn't get
a chance to bring it up,
but there were actually
several opportunities
where the light
hadn't gone off yet,
so you had chances,
but they slipped
through your fingers somehow.
- Right.
- Right now, it looks more like
you're going to an awards show
rather than an inauguration.
It doesn't look expensive
or luxurious,
and, um, is that
your bra strap coming out--
- Right here?
- On this side?
- It made my titty look funny
if I pushed it down.
I can put it away for you.
- Girl, do not wear your bra
sticking out of a gown.
[imitates slap]
- Okay.
- It's better.
- All right.
Up next, Sharon Needles.
So tell me about
your inaugural gown.
- It's, uh,
it's a little futuristic
because, let's be honest,
a drag queen's not gonna be
president for 100 years,
so I had to think ahead.
- [laughs]
- It works. It all works.
The proportions work,
and the nude and the black,
and especially with the hair
you have tonight,
you hit the nail on the head.
- As far as your debate goes,
I just got that you were a woman
there who meant business
and you wanted to be heard.
I thought you got the message
across hilariously.
- I'll be honest, I got scared
as hell when you came out
on the runway tonight.
It was good and bad for me.
- Sharon Needles, is there
anything you'd like to say.
- Um, I love vodka, and, um--
[laughter]
I have responsibly enjoyed your
company many a night.
[laughter]
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
[engine starting sound effect]
All right.
Just between us girls,
let's caucus,
starting with Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Phi Phi committed
to the Palinesque character.
Even if one or two of her jokes
fell flat,
I still thought
it was believable.
- I have respect for people
who should be committed
and are committed.
[laughter]
But it kind of flopped.
It didn't really hit the jokes.
So, for me, it misses the mark.
- All right...Dida Ritz.
Well, she said she was
intimidated by this challenge.
- But you have to go
out on a limb sometimes,
and you have to step
out of your comfort zone.
I mean, this is a competition.
- She's a beautiful queen.
- Beautiful.
- But there's always
something off about Dida.
She'll get the hair right
and the makeup right,
and then the body's off.
She'll get the body right,
and then the hair's like, what?
- Now, Michelle, any cons?
[laughter]
- I think she's fierce.
- No, she is, absolutely.
That's why she's here.
- Is she taking advantage
of being here?
Like, is she gonna take some
feedback and make some changes,
or just react defensively?
- Let's move on down the line
to Chad Michaels.
- I loved Chad
during the debate.
It wasn't just
this one-note character,
kind of like Phi Phi had.
Chad had a fully-realized
human being.
- And she was going
for yet another character.
I love a chameleon,
but we've seen a lot already,
and I'd love just a glimpse of
who the real Chad Michaels is.
- All right.
Latrice Royale.
- She didn't have a character.
She started strong,
and I was really in it with her,
and then I think
she lost her way.
- And why do we
have to tell somebody
to tuck their bra in their dre--
like, this is top five, people.
But they shouldn't be making
these mistakes at this point.
- That's true.
- But in the debate,
she was an imposing presence,
uh, and people look for that
in a president.
She had gravitas.
- There's an ointment
that will clear that up.
[laughter]
Sharon Needles.
- I love her aesthetic
and I love her sense of humor,
and I thought
it was really effective.
We're all here,
pretending that a drag queen
could get elected president,
and she walked out there
and said, "Not for 100 years."
- [laughs]
- And she's right.
- But you have to remember,
if you're gonna be America's
next drag superstar,
you don't want to do
shock value all the time.
- All right.
Silence!
Bring back...my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
The votes have been tallied.
Chad Michaels,
you created
a candidate with character,
and you took the wig party
back to its roots.
You're safe.
- Thanks, guys.
- Sharon Needles, you took your
campaign to hell and back
and gave us much more
than politics as usual.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge...
[applause]
And you've won a $5,000
gift certificate
from interiorillusionshome.com.
- Thank you so much, and, um,
see you at the Iowa primary.
- Dida Ritz,
during the debates,
you cracked.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Oh, my God.
I'm gagging.
The last thing I want is for me
to be in the bottom two.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, your
politically incorrect politician
was...polarizing.
Latrice Royale, your debating
skills were debatable.
Phi Phi O'Hara...
you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Latrice Royale,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- [silently]
Okay.
I'm devastated,
but I'm not ready to go.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
[dramatic music]
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
- I am in heaven.
I am channeling<i> Superstar.</i>
Honey, I feel
like I'm performing
to an arena of 20,000 people.
- This is old school.
- You need to understand where
these words are coming from
and get the emotion out,
and that's what I did.
- Latrice was taking me
to church.
I mean, my skin started smoking.
She was good.
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]
- Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Latrice Royale...
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you, thank you.
Love you, baby.
- [whispering]
- Dida Ritz,
you are a young queen
with a lot of imagination,
so keep on keepin' on.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
See you later.
I'm not upset.
I have no regrets at all.
This is only the beginning.
I've made it all the way
to top five,
and I am<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royalty now.</i>
- Ladies, as you know,
each week,
I consult with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
Once again, I've been criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle, I want you
to confer with Santino
to decide which one
of the eliminated queens
deserves to return...
[dramatic chord]
To this competition.
- [gasps]
- Oh, shit.
Here we go again.
- No!
Bitch, top four.
No mo' hos.
- Will it be Alisa summers,
Lashauwn Beyond, the Princess,
Madame LaQueer,
Li'l Kenya Michaels,
Milan, Jiggly Caliente,
Willam, or Dida Ritz?
Choose wisely, Michelle,
for the world is watching.
Now, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.





- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you'll need to survive
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.
The Rupocalypse.
- [screams]
- Ooh, shit,
it's falling apart.
- Jiggly's costume
is a hot mess.
- Jiggly Caliente...
Lashauwn Beyond...
The Princess, Sharon Needles.
- This is my kind of ghoul.
- Con-drag-ulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- I'm just in disbelief
that I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey, you better snap
out of it.
Play to win.
Jiggly Caliente,
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Alisa Summers, sashay away.
And tonight...
you'll be transforming
yourselves into wrestling's
trashiest fighters.
The dolls throw down...
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.
Get out of here.
[audience oohing]
- And take flight.
- Chicago, bitch.
[screaming]
- With extra-special
guest judges
NBA stars Rick Fox
and John Salley.

and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- A gorgeous day.
- Good morning, cluckers.
- We walk in the work room this
morning, and we see Alisa's
message, and it's kind of sad.
I mean, it was official.
Week by week, we're all going to
be going home.
- "Keep it cute, ladies!
"Shady sisters 4-ever!
Love, Alisa."
- Look what you've done.
- That's what you've done, baby.
- It was either her or me,
and I was not going home.
- Let's take a vote.
Can we switch Jiggly for Alisa?
- Yeah, I agree.
- Whoo!
[laughter]
- Being in the bottom two
shook me.
I feel like there's a target
on the back of my head.
And all these bitches are trying
to assassinate me.
So nervous now.
'Cause now I have to really
prove myself.
- Well, can I give you
a piece of advice?
Just really try to stay
more focused
on the competition.
Like, don't--
- I know.
- It was, like--I thought
that I was focused.
I feel like I have to claw
and dig my way
back to the top.
- So you're feeling good
about your win?
- Oh, I'm feeling fantastic
about my win.
- You fucking rocked it.
It was kind of made for you.
- I know.
I'm such a natural loser
that it was very odd for me
to win a challenge.
I'm the freak queen,
and back home,
I'm kind of like
the laughingstock
of the drag community.
And I'm not
used to winning anything.
So it's exciting,
but at the same time,
it's really humbling.
- They're calling you the silent
killer, bitch, because
everybody thought you were gonna
win the challenge.
- I mean, I did think I was
gonna win,
but I understand
why I didn't win.
- Well, after she had said--
- I'm too quiet.
- Yeah, you're too quiet, bitch.
- I was quiet because I was
trying to focus.
My strategy isn't gonna change,
because I know that I prepared
a package to beat these girls.
So, I mean, I'm fine.
- Speak up, Lashauwn.
- Can everybody hear me?
- Fly away.
[siren wails]
[all oohing]
- Girl, you got she-mail.
[cheers]
Hello, dolls.
all: Hi.
- I've come to pump you up.
And I don't mean your lips.
So get ready to beat your mug,
pummel the runway, and fight for
the spotlight.
It's time for some necessary
roughness.
But, remember, just anything
but the face.
I'll get the money, mister.
Just don't hurt my face, please.
[applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
- RuPaul!
- Hi.
[cheers and applause]
Now, ladies, as you know,
padding is the foundation
of drag.
A queen's girlish figure
depends on it.
For today's mini challenge, I
want you to make an ass
of yourself.
Literally. Oh, pit crew.
- Whoo!
- You have 30 minutes to put
all this junk in your trunk.
I'm dividing you
into three groups.
And the one queen from each
group with the juiciest ass
will win.
Ready, set, style.
[exclamations and shouting]
- Don't kick over my packing
peanuts.
- I make fierce pads, but this
ain't how I usually make my
pads, y'all.
- 30 minutes is not enough.
You need at least a good hour
to even start making pads.
- When making your ass, always
draw the shape of Africa.
- That's it.
- Or, as Latrice would say,
the homeland.
- [giggles]
I'm Polynesian, bitch.
Get it straight, honey.
- I thought we were doing an
athletic challenge,
so I'm in a jock.
Sorry about it.
- Okay, lady-kins, time's up.
All right.
Apple bottoms.
Now Jiggly is serving cellulite
realness.
[laughter]
- Yeah, that's how realness is.
- Now walk that ass.
Bottoms up.
Shake it, don't break it.
Phi Phi O'Hara, now that's what
I call a power bottom.
Seems like your pants are coming
down, Madame.
- [screams]
[laughter]
- Madame.
- Next up, the ghetto booties.
Make it pop. Now walk.
- Hips don't lie.
But that ass do.
Girl, can I get some fries
with that shake?
[laughter]
Damn.
- I had a proper ghetto booty,
and I was the only one wearing
lipstick.
- Next up, the badonkadonks.
- A badonkadonk booty, it's
like a whole bunch of
donkadonkadonkadonkadadadada...
- Now walk.
Ass everywhere, ass everywhere.
Ass everywhere.
Ooh, two scoops.
Ladies, all y'all
is sassy assassins.
But three of you really
killed it.
The winners of this mini
challenge are...
Miss Phi Phi O'Hara...
[cheers]
Miss Willam...
[applause]
Miss Chad Michaels.
- Hey.
- Con-drag-ulations.
If I were you, I'd hold on tight
to my padded ass, because, for
this week's main challenge,
you'll be transforming
yourselves into wrestling's
trashiest fighters--the luscious
ladies of the WTF.
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo.
- I am a big bitch.
Who is gonna outwrestle me?
Nobody.
- Oh, my god.
I am not athletic at all.
- This week, you'll need to
flex your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent to become
over-the-top wrestling
characters.
You will compete in teams.
Phi Phi O'Hara, Willam,
Chad Michaels, since you won the
mini challenge,
you are team captains.
You get to pick your queens,
starting with Phi Phi.
- I'd have to go with Latrice.
- Yes.
- Dida.
- I will take Milan.
- Yeah.
- Come on down, baby.
- Kenya.
- [growls]
- Princess.
- Miss Needles.
- I am a knockout.
[laughter]
Uh, ow.
- I didn't want Jiggly or
Madame LaQueer because they're
always complaining that their
feet hurt or they don't want to
do active stuff.
Lashauwn.
- [growls]
- There we go.
- All right, Willam, it's
between Jiggly and
Madame LaQueer.
- I'm just praying, "Please pick
me, pick me, pick me,
pick me, pick me."
- Jiggly.
- [grunts]
- Yes!
- Wah!
[laughter and applause]
- All right, so that means
that Chad gets Madame LaQueer.
- It feels kind of weird
being, like, the last picked.
You know, the weird boy, but
I'm used to it, though.
- Each team needs to decide
which two will play the
heroines, or the faces, and
which two will play the
villains, or the heels.
In a moment, you'll meet three
pros who will coach you in the
art of wrestling.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
- Let's do a script.
- Mama, you got a dream team
here.
- I know.
That's why I picked it.
- There's something very
important.
I had a previous injury
in my right ankle.
I hurt my right ankle
doing a show.
I didn't saw the step, and my
ankle goes click, and suddenly
I couldn't walk.
- Are you gonna be okay, I
mean, like, with your ankle?
- Don't worry about my ankle.
- I am gonna worry about it,
because it's important.
If your ankle's hurting and you
can't do something, you need to
let me know, because I can't
read your mind.
- I'm so happy with this team.
- I know. I'm excited.
- This challenge includes a lot
of steps.
We have to come up with a back
story, looks, costumes,
moves, everything.
I'm really good with falls and
being, like, stunted.
I do stairs. I can do anything.
I'm really excited because I
usually play people who get beat
up, and I got my ass kicked on
every major network.
- And we just make sure that
we--attitude, attitude,
attitude.
- Wrestling isn't my thing.
I'm not a violent person.
So I'm a little concerned.
- We are gonna ace this,
you guys.
We gon' kick their ass.
- So our challenge is to become
wrestlers.
We're the first team to go up
and practice.
I see three humungous dudes just
going at each other.
Oh, my god. This is real.
- [whimpers]
- I'm "Hollywood's Own"
Joey Ryan.
-<i> Yo soy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Hector "El Chido"</i>
Canales.
- I'm Mr. K.O.S.
"King of Submission"
Ryan Taylor.
- Let's now get into a little
bit of the choreography.
Go ahead and throw her
onto Ryan.
- Oh.
- You're gonna catch her and
fall.
- This bitch heavy.
- And then you fall
on your back.
- Oh, my god.
- Fall, bitch.
- As safely as possible.
- Oh, my god.
- I'm worried Lashauwn's not
gonna actually get the concept
of what she has to do here.
Come on, girl. Come on.
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [whimpers]
- [growls]
- Everyone in my group's
personality is so loud...
[yells]
And I'm not really like that.
I'm really quiet and soft.
Oh.
[laughter]
- My god, Latrice.
- We're gonna show you
some strikes to the gut.
- [grunts]
- The big reaction is his sell.
And your sell will be here
and to the camera.
- All right.
I'm an actor.
I've been on TV a lot.
I'm cool. I can do it.
[grunting]
- Pop off, bitch!
- And I did.
I sold it.
I get a People's Choice.
- So the bad guys make their
entrance, they cannot care less
about the audience, right?
Make us hate you.
- Be yourself.
- I got this.
This is cake. Fuck y'all.
I don't give a shit.
New York, motherfuckers.
Brooklyn!
- Jiggly was very aggressive.
- Fuck y'all.
I've got this shit.
- And I was like, girl, take it
down a notch.
- New York, baby.
- I'm not from New York.
- Oh...
- And you were good too.
Princess is giving
closed-captioning,
while she's in stereo.
- Okay, you guys.
Exaggerate, okay?
Like, "Aah!"
Loud. Noise.
- Ahh!
- Larger than that.
- What the hell was that?
- I'm worried about Princess
because she's quiet.
I'm going "Rah! NY, baby!
This is--"
And she's like...
[mumbling indistinctly ]
And I'm like, "Huh?"
- We're gonna demonstrate some
holds for you.
Some wrestling moves for you.
We were thinking of a body slam.
- [laughs]
- Do any of you guys
have a problem with that?
- I'm a little worried
about the physical
extremities of this challenge.
- Let's have you try that
to her.
- Okay. All right.
Come on, Mrs. Ed,
with that horse face of yours.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop a second. Stop.
Stop a second. Stop a second.
Stop a second. Stop a second.
You don't want to pick--
- Like a baby.
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, Grandma.
Oh, my God!
Let me go.
[both grunting]
RuPaul once famously said
that drag
is not a contact sport.
Apparently, she's gone back
on her word.
[coughing]
- From there, we're gonna have
you give her
the airplane spin,
which they're gonna demonstrate
right now.
- It's a very fun--
- Okay.
- I'm concerned that something
could happen with my ankle and
making our team lose.
I have a lot
to be nervous about.
- All right, come on, Madame.
My damn face is sick
of looking at you.
- [grunting]
- Oh. Oh!
- Get her up.
- Put me down.
- Take your time. Slow.
- Jeez Louise.
- Ugh.
- Sorry.
- Ouch.
- You okay?
- I'm nervous about Madame
LaQueer.
She's not as physical as the
rest of us.
She really has to push, push,
and push through it.
- Ouch.
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?
Y'all look like a sweat shop.
- I'm sorry, but did you see
Willam's outfit?
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi's gonna like me
eventually.
I know it.
I think her and I should just
unite with mutual enemies.
- [scoffs]
- I mean, it's just easier
to go after ugly people,
but, I mean, the ugly people
are gonna be gone
soon enough anyway.
- Okay, well, then who's
the ugly people?
- Well, not me.
- Hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Well, team Phi Phi O'Hara...
- Yes.
- Which team is the faces?
- It would be me and Lashauwn.
- So, of course, these two
are the heels.
What is your story?
- They gave us the wrong
treatment, and we grew beards
instead, and we're a little
bitter about that.
- Are you actually gonna
be wearing beards?
- Yes.
- You know, that concerns me a
little bit, because the luscious
ladies of the WTF need to be
beautiful.
- I think our story will get
across, and it's not that they--
- But you're not the one who's
gonna be looking hideous,
are you, darling?
People watch wrestling because
they want to be excited, they
want to be turned on.
They want beauty.
Now, Lashauwn, can you give me
a little taste of what your good
guy says?
- "Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass."
- In wrestling, the good guys
are just as loud and obnoxious
as the bad guys.
Is it fair to say that you're
still working on it,
you haven't...
- Yeah, we are
still working on it.
I mean, yeah, we are.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
All right.
- Bye, Ru.
- Team Willam, what's going on?
Who on your team are the faces?
[laughs]
Now what are your costumes
gonna be like?
Was that something that you made
or you already had?
- We just embellished
on top of it.
- Oh, I see.
- And I'm embellishing on top
of mine as well.
- Jiggly, you took some heat
last week for your costume.
- Yeah.
- You know, we are looking for
the luscious ladies of the WTF.
- Oh, I'll be luscious.
I'm not trying to be in that
bottom two again.
- Gather around, dolls.
Now, tomorrow at the WTF
main event,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges...
NBA champions Rick Fox
and John Salley.
[cheers and applause]
- I think I'll tuck extra-tight
for Rick Fox and John Salley.
- Now, remember, safety first.
But, whatever you do,
don't fuck it up.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Whoo.
[cheers]
- Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready to experience a female
phenomenon?
[cheers]
Bring on the glamazons!
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god, can you believe
those Bitter Betties
came in here to ask us for help?
And I even let them use, like,
my really good hair products.
- That product?
- Yeah.
- That's the hair-growing tonic.
- [speaks native language]
- You--look what you did
to her hair.
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?
- Your plastic hair and your
plastic tits
and your plastic ass.
We'll handle you.
We'll get in the ring.
- Bring it. Bring it on.
- Come on, girls. Come on.
[cheers]
[rock music]
- Mess with these nasty girls
and you'll end up with a bad
taste in your mouth.
Give it up for Latrice
"The Beast"
and "Killer" Kenya,
the Bitter Betties.
- Ooh.
[booing]
Go.
- Give it up for L.A.'s finest,
Lashauwn "The Blonde"
and Phi Phi "Fierce."
- The crowd was chanting and
all the signs had our names
everywhere.
It felt so good.
I was ready to beat those
bitches down.
[bell clinks]
- You're so pretty.
[exclamations]
- Ooh.
- Whoa!
[booing]
[cheers and applause]
- Get up!
- [speaks Spanish]
- Um, honey, I don't speak
Spanish.
[booing]
- I want to teach you Spanish
right now.
<i>Puta!</i>
[exclamations]
[screaming]
- Oh, hell, no.
- [shouts]
- Now I'm gonna show you how
to really beat a mug, bitch.
[screaming]
[booing]
Let me go! Let me go!
[screams]
[overlapping statements]
[screaming]
[exclamations]
[shrieking]
[bell rings]
[booing]
- Bitter, bitter pill
to swallow.
The Bitter Betties win.
[booing]
- Those other teams
better watch out
because, me and my girls,
we kicked ass.
[booing]
- Touch this skin, honey.
They can't take it.
- Mm-mm. They're overgrown...
both: Orangutans.
- Speaking of orangutans.
- What are you doing in our
dressing room?
- We know it's your dressing
room, as tacky as it is,
like y'all two bitches.
both: Tacky?
- Oh, no, honey, we don't want
to go there.
We saw you two
in Coach Carter's office.
- Oh, so that's how we got
kicked out of school?
'Cause of y'all bitches?
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.
Get out of here.
[cheers and applause]
- Tuck and cover...
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck out of here.
- For "Pucker Up" Princess
and "J-Train" Jiggly,
the Thunder Booties.
Get on the wrong side of these
sexy scissor sisters, and
they'll cut you--
Willamina "Hater"
and Dida "Diddles".
They're DWF.
- Come on, bitch.
[booing]
[bell clinks]
- Get 'em, girl.
- You plus-sized jujube.
- Oh, please.
[exclamations]
- Come on, bitch.
[exclamations]
- I'm giving it all, balls to
the wall, badass, crazy,
wrestler bitch.
- Whoop her ass.
[cheers]
- Get her!
- [yells]
- The Princess, she's not going
as crazy as I am.
So if I get in the bottom two
because of this bitch, it ain't
gonna be cute.
[shouting]
What?
- It's not fair.
[indistinct shouting]
That's not fair!
- Sumo smash!
[exclamations]
- And thank you.
[bell rings]
- The winner is Thunder Booties.
- Team Willam
put on a goddamn show.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, Milan "LaModel", I have
to be honest with you.
I woke up with an itch down
there,
an itch in my pubic hair.
- I've got snatch-scratch
fever too.
- But forget about
this bitch of an itch.
Look who it is.
It's the Bitch Kickers.
- What's up there, Knockouts?
How's it hanging,
scratch 'n' sniff?
- [speaks nonsense]
- They must have gotten our
special delivery we sent in
when we banged their boyfriends.
- [chatters nonsense]
Boink, boink.
- Oh, my god.
- That's right, LaQueer.
- Those Bitch Kickers.
Oh, those cheap, terrible girls.
[cheers and applause]
- Serving face with a side of
whoop-ass.
Give it up for Sharon "Shocker"
and Milan "LaModel"--
the Knockouts.
Don't hate these girls because
they're beautiful.
[booing]
- Shut your pie hole, you slut.
- Hate them because
they're bitches.
- You want some of this?
We got plenty for you too.
- Chadarella "Chainsaw" Michaels
and Madame "LaCrush"--
the Bitch Kickers.
[bell clinks]
- You skinny little
blonde bimbo.
You can run, but you can't hide.
- All right, well, I'm fast
as a butterfly--
[exclamations]
No!
[booing]
[coughs]
- I am a little bit worried
about Madame LaQueer 's ankle.
I mean, you're the captain
of the ship,
you're going down
with the ship.
- All right, Kirstie Alley
before<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>
[exclamations]
[shouts indistinctly]
This is not in my contract!
- If my ankle hurted, I forgot
about everything.
I was Madame "LaCrush"
in that moment.
[cheers and applause]
- Joan Jett called.
She wants her wig back.
[exclamations]
[shouting]
[crowd chanting indistinctly]
- You're mine now, baby!
I'm gonna hit you
in your visage.
[crowd chanting "USA"]
- No one hits my sister!
Why?
Because I'm sickening, bitch!
[cheers]
- Chicago, bitch!
[shouting]
[cheers and applause]
[bell rings]
- Okay.
- The Knockouts have won!
[cheers and applause]
- We might have been slightly
sloppy,
but I think our team created
the best characters.
[cheers and applause]
- Yay.
- Miss Cheesecake.
It's elimination day, and
everyone's really anxious right
now to find out how they did in
the wrestling challenge.
I think we have a really good
shot at winning.
- I hope.
- I'm just worried.
- What are you worried about?
You did great.
You were so funny.
Were you unpleased with anything
when you left the ring
yesterday?
- With me, no.
I am kind of iffy
about Princess.
It is a competition, and, they
don't like one thing, the whole
team goes on--
it's a team challenge.
- That energy you're giving off
is bringing everybody else down.
Girl, I cannot be bothered
right now.
- Are you nervous today?
- You know what, I am a little
bit nervous.
You might feel some sort of kind
of way, and you could be dead
wrong.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thinking you sickening bitch
and talented bitch,
and they be like, "wah-wah-wah."
- I'm a little nervous to see
what the judges think about me
in the ring.
I did my best, but you never
know what they're gonna say.
- You sew for all the girls
back at home?
Like, the girls.
The girls the girls.
- Just girls like you.
By me sewing so much, I don't
really get a chance
to even be in drag myself.
- Uh-huh.
- So it's like I missed
my drag childhood.
- Ha ha.
- So that's why the competition
is perfect for me, 'cause I'm
just filling in for what I
missed out on.
- That's sickening, 'cause you
definitely
about to make up
for some lost time.
- Ooh.
- Hey-hey, that's what you get.
The ultimate drag boot camp
of life.
- Madame, what does your family
think about you doing drag?
- I'm not close to my family
at all.
My family, for me, are my
friends.
They're the best friends
in the whole world.
Baby, don't. It's okay,<i> mami.</i>
- We're selfish and vain
creatures of beauty, and isn't
it bizarre how we make the best
friends in the world?
- [laughs maniacally]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, baby.
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, my tag team
sister.
- I got a full nelson for you
right here, mama.
- [chuckles]
Billy B, welcome home.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Are you wrestling
with something?
- Not since I was trying to get
my wallet back
from Michelle in the back.
- [chuckles]
Hey, Rick Fox, what did you
think of my girls?
- I was impressed.
Think there was a lot of fight.
- Good. And John Salley.
- Hello, Ru.
- BK in the house.
[laughter]
I'm so glad you're here.
This week, our queens were
challenged to hit the mats as
the luscious ladies of the WTF.
Tonight, I've asked them all
to come decked out in their best
girly-girl attire.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
First up, Kenya Michaels.
Gorgeous.
You know, lil' Kim only wishes.
- It's a pink Monday.
- I love the runway.
I feel amazing
because I love to walk.
- Now that is a living doll.
- Mary-Kate Minaj.
Lashauwn Beyond.
She melts in your mouth,
not in your hand.
- Got a penny? She's got a ball.
- [laughs]
- I'm serving bubble gum
yum-yum,
just having fun being
flirty, pretty, going girly
beyond.
- I'd like to stick a quarter
in her slot.
- Where is her slot anyway?
- Sharon Needles.
- Ooh.
The lost Arquette sister.
- Oh, wow, she's doing femme.
She got an injection of beauty.
- Playing girly-ish, bouncy,
and sexy is just something
really foreign to me.
Just want to show the judges
that I could bring beauty
to the stage
in this competition.
- Mwah.
For your consideration,
Jiggly Caliente.
- Kimora lee Simmons
has put on some weight.
- You're jiggling, girl.
- I'm serving banjee girl
meets sweet 16, very new York.
- It's Jiggly 's quinceanara.
London, Paris, Milan.
I see London, I see France, I
see Milan 's underpants.
- I am feeling like black Barbie
meets a valley girl.
But, because John Salley is
there, I'd rather
be the Salley girl.
- Once she gets pumping,
it's hard to make the body stop.
- Madame LaQueer.
Representing Puerto Rico.
- [speaks Spanish]
She's working the asymmetrical
hairdo.
- Or a hair show in Mississippi.
- I feel great.
I feel like I'm floating.
I think is the most beautiful
I've looked
throughout all the competitions.
- Where there's smoke,
there's a pussy on fire.
[laughter]
- This is why I love this show.
- Dida Ritz.
- I thought
it was P. Diddy's mom.
- [laughs]
- Janice Combs.
- I'm giving fish, I'm giving
face, I'm giving you vogue.
I know my runway is fierce.
- Look at those legs.
My good--and they go
all the way up.
- They do? Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- They're not wooden?
- Chad Michaels.
Lady "chadderley".
Oh, my goodness, the world
according to Paris.
- Paris Hilton,
where are they now?
- I'm serving up girly-girl
realness fish on a stick.
I kind of look just like
a yummy little cupcake.
- Heidi Montag called.
She wants her old body back.
The Princess.
She had a little time
for a quick blowout
before she came out.
- It's a windstorm backstage,
I'm thinking.
- Yes, yes.
- The look I'm going for is
very rock star
meets little girl.
I am so pumped
for my look today.
- Rock on.
- It's like there's something
about The Princess.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Telemundo.
- Telenovela realness.
- I was showing
a little bit of skin
and giving them dragged-out
Miami housewife.
- Ooh, her legs are like peanut
butter--easy to spread.
Latrice Royale.
Ooh, crown Royale.
I'll have one on the rocks.
- I am feeling good and
looking gorgeous, darling.
Pretty in pink.
I was very pleased.
- Star Jones called.
She wants her old body back.
- She can't have it.
It's otherwise preoccupied.
- Allegedly.
[laughter]
Next up, Willam.
- Hey.
- Wow.
Look at those shoes.
- My look for today
is rich bitch mistress.
I'm serving girly-girl on a
platter to go,
sauce on the side.
- Look how her outfit
accentuates her sugar walk.
-<i> Toddlers and Tiaras,</i>
where are they now?
- I think she's Tanya Tucker.
My girls.
You look smashing.
Yesterday, you changed the face
of professional wrestling
forever.
I smell a spin-off.
But one group in particular
really smacked down
the competition.
The winning WTF team is...
Team Chad Michaels.
- Whoo!
- Jesus.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Ru.
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
But two divas stole the show.
Madame LaQueer, Chad Michaels.
- The Bitch Kickers.
- Good job, ladies.
- You are both the winners of
this week's challenge.
You'll receive a selection of
wigs from Risque Wigs.
- Oh, my god, I feel so great.
I certainly actually proved them
wrong about having
picking me last.
- However, neither of you will
receive immunity next week.
Team Chad Michaels, you may
leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time for the
judges' critiques.
First up, Willam.
Hey, mama.
- Hi.
- Did everything turn out
the way you had planned?
- I think our moves kicked ass.
- Oh, I thought the competition
was weak in the ring.
The faces she was giving us
just didn't seem believable.
It was fake.
- Wait a minute.
Wrestling is not fake.
- No, that wrestling was fake.
- Thank you, Willam.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
Now why'd you choose this
as your girly look?
- I'm really channeling
Carrie Bradshaw,
so I thought downtown
New York, very chic.
- In the ring, you had,
you know,
the girl that sort of walked
around the ring thing perfect,
better than you had
the wrestling down.
- Thank you, Dida.
The Princess.
- I'm a fan from the hair
to the dress.
I think I bought that dress
for my daughter.
- I disagree. I hate your hair.
I think it looks
like a bad hair show.
- As far as the performance
goes, we didn't see any of the
rebel that I know you are.
- I'm a very Zen person.
Just know that
that was me really trying.
- Try harder.
- All right,
let's go to Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course you can, Ru.
- How'd you feel on the runway?
- I felt so cute.
The lollipop in my mouth,
door knockers in my ears.
- The lollipop was more
interesting for me
than what you're doing
style-wise.
- And tell me about in the ring.
- It was very energetic
and over the top.
- Jiggly, what was the hardest
part of this challenge?
- The thing is, Princess is very
Zen, she's very quiet.
We needed to be, like, crazy,
badass bitches.
- It's hard,
when you're in a team,
and you're trying to make up
for both of you.
- Thank you, Jiggly.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi.
- You were reading older
than you have to.
You could be younger
and more modern.
- I'm watching you, Phi Phi.
I love you.
I think you're gorgeous,
and in the ring,
you were freakin' hi-lar-i-ous.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
Lashauwn Beyond.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are your balls?
- My balls are great.
- On the runway,
the gumball machine
told me exactly what
those balls were doing
on your chest.
- Better than on her chin.
- Ha!
- I couldn't disagree more.
Your hair and your makeup,
you look like
a backup singer for
Luther Vandross in 1988.
- Rick Fox, what'd you think?
The ring?
- It's not memorable enough
for me.
I would have liked
a little more story
and color to the character.
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.
- Hola.
- I thought it was Nicki Minaj.
I'm not joking you.
Except she doesn't have the ass
of Nicki or the money.
- What about as a wrestler?
As "Killer" Kenya?
- It was like it was
Biggie Smalls and lil' Kim
all over again.
Baby, baby.
- [laughs]
- You look like a star, you
look modern, you look
fashionable, and I think you're
the one to beat.
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale.
- Hello, Ru.
- Shag-quille O'Neal Latrice.
- [laughs]
- You set the tone for the
whole afternoon.
- Oh!
- You had me at splat.
- [laughs]
Thank you, Latrice.
Well, ladies, I think we've
heard enough.
While you girls untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge, the
judges and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
brothers and brother-lovers...
- Thank you.
- Let's start with Willam.
- I think Willam is extremely
fierce and extremely talented
and very freakin' funny.
But I also think there's
a borderline of smarminess.
I think there might
be an attitude in there
that can get in the way.
- She seemed like a team captain
that didn't lead.
- I think she did a good job
of leading.
I don't feel that The Princess
did a good job of following.
- All right, let's talk
about The Princess.
- Her performance
was really flat.
- I kind of thought
there was a rock star in there.
- She's not charismatic enough
to be a rock star.
- Dida Ritz.
- She's pretty.
It's just the wigs are not
styled, they're not done.
- You know, she was going
for<i> Sex and the City,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and it was more like<i> </i>
<i>Sex in the Alley.</i>
- Oh, okay.
Well, I'm not gonna turn
that down either.
- [laughs]
- Jiggly Caliente.
- In the ring, she uses
everything she has.
I thought that was an outfit
until I realized that was really
her belly.
- [laughs]
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I don't know what's under
all that makeup,
but she doesn't
paint herself pretty.
- I know she's heavy-handed
on the makeup, but hey...
who isn't?
- [laughs]
Lashauwn Beyond.
Now, it was remarked that
Lashauwn's personality
was kind of shy.
- She'll get out of that shyness
when she realizes it doesn't get
her anywhere.
- She's a mess.
And her personality is like a...
Like a brick.
- All right, Kenya Michaels.
Little Puerto Rican sweetheart.
- She's half the size
of any of them
with double or triple
everything else.
There was nothing wrong.
- Her performance was flawless
as well.
I thought she did a great job
as "Killer" Kenya.
- Latrice Royale.
- She owned that role
in the ring.
It was hard for anyone else
to do better than that.
- I was very happy with her,
and I do really like her
and her personality.
So she's gonna be fun to watch.
- All right, silence.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your presentation
in the main ring
and on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Latrice Royale, Kenya Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
you ladies jumped
on this wrestling challenge
and came out on top.
You are all safe.
- Thank you.
- You may leave the stage.
Jiggly Caliente,
we want to know,
is there more to you than just
a queen from the 'hood?
You are safe.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
The Princess.
You were channeling pink,
but your performance was beige.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I'm shocked.
My outfit was on it today,
whether Billy B
liked my hair or not.
And I worked my ass off
yesterday in the ring.
There's no reason why I should
have been in the bottom two.
- Willam...
you're safe.
- Bye.
- Lashauwn Beyond,
as a wrestler, you were more
mumble than rumble.
Dida Ritz, your<i> Sex and the City</i>
couture
does not deserve a sequel.
Dida Ritz...
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Lashauwn Beyond, I'm sorry,
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.
- My whole body started pumping.
I'm nervous because I want
to stay in the competition
and I know this dictates
if I will or not.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save
yourself from elimination.
The time has come to lip-sync
for your life.
- I'm pretty amazing,
and I'm ready to show it.
Bring it on.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I want to show Ru that I can
give more personality.
It's not over yet.
I'm not ready to go.
- I'm telling myself, soak up
this moment right now.
Live in it.
Balls to the wall do it.
- To do the whole song with
no shoes in closed-toed
pantyhose like a web-footed
duck, Lashauwn 's drag mother's
gonna read him for not even
starting the song in shoes.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
The Princess...
Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Lashauwn...
you are a young queen.
May this experience lift you
to new heights above and beyond.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you.
It's bittersweet, but...
I'm happy for me to be so young
and I've only been doing it for
such a short amount of time.
Some of these girls
being 40 and 50
and so...it was sickening.
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play!


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
- I look spooky,
but I'm really nice.
- The weakest out of everybody,
I would say, is Sharon Needles.
- Shut up!
-<i> Are you ready to experience</i>
<i>a female phenomenon?</i>
[cheers and applause]
-<i> I'm nervous</i>
<i>about Madame LaQueer.</i>
She's not as physical
as the rest of us.
- Oh!
[screaming]
- Madame LaQueer,
Chad Michaels.
<i>You are both the winners</i>
<i>of this week's challenge.</i>
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I feel so great.</i>
I certainly actually
proved them wrong.
- The Princess...
shantay, you stay.
Lashauwn, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Music makes the people
come together.
<i>The dolls</i>
<i>get a special guest...</i>
- Hallelujah!
-<i> And testify.</i>
- All right.
-<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Natalie Cole</i>
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glee's</i><i> Amber Riley.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics,</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind trip</i>
<i>courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring Absolut Vodka--</i>
<i>cocktails perfected--</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
[tires squealing]
<i>- Cheesecake.</i>
both: Cheesecake.
- Cluck, cluck, queens.
- My baby's gone.
[wailing] My baby's gone.
- Aww.
-<i> All of my girls are gone.</i>
<i>This is the real deal.</i>
If you're not on top
of your Ps and your Qs,
you'll be X'd.
- "Stay true to you. XOXO."
Princess, what was it like
to lip-sync for your life?
- I just had fun with it.
If this is the last time
I'm on the stage,
I'm gonna soak it up.
Being in the bottom two
was ridiculously awful.
all: Awww!
-<i> So I need to step it up</i>
<i>a little bit more.</i>
Peace out.
- The bitch could sew.
- She sure could.
- She was very talented.
- Well, she's gone now.
- Man your stations.
- [laughs]
- Do you think you deserve
to be in the bottom?
- No.
- Who do you think deserved
to be in the bottom?
- Jiggly.
I think if I were to do it over,
after the comment
that you said...
- The thing is,
Princess is very Zen.
She's very quiet.
We needed to be, like,
crazy bitches.
- I probably would go back
and say, "Jiggly can go."
- Now, would you just say that
because she said something, or--
- Fuck yeah.
[siren blares]
all: Ooh.
- Yeah.
<i>- You've got shemail.</i>
Listen up, glamazons.
America's next drag superstar
is no one-hit wonder.
So if you want to live forever,
you've got to be a champion.
And with a little bit of love,
even a ladyboy
can be a cover girl.
And for the record,
those are all available
on iTunes.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
[cheers]
- Ladies, for today's
mini-challenge,
we're gonna do a little
something different.
We're gonna do something
for someone else.
- Oh.
- Imagine that.
Now, I love making music.
And I'm honored whenever anyone
makes an online video
of one of my songs.
But there's one in particular
that really moved me.
And I want to share it with you.
[RuPaul's<i> If I Dream]</i>
That's Piyah Martell.
She was born
with caudal regression syndrome
that prevented her legs
from growing.
That hasn't stopped her
from dreaming big.
Piyah's always wanted to be
a part of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
and I've invited her here today.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, diva!
All right, Mama.
Diva!
- Hello, my darling.
Mwah, mwah.
- [giggles]
- Now, Piyah, honey.
You were delivering such
Mariah Carey realness
in that video.
[laughter]
You really captured that song.
- If you really do believe
in something,
you can't give up, you know?
If you dream and dream,
one day, it can happen.
- Piyah just went
right to my heart.
To see her pursuing her dreams,
it was very inspiring.
- Our mini-challenge today
is inspired by you.
Ladies, Piyah has an online
following,
and she calls her fans
butterflies.
You're gonna create
a fashion-forward headpiece
that Piyah can wear
in her next video
with these colorful butterflies.
So, ladies, you need to pair up,
so pick a partner.
All right, so there's
an odd number of queens,
so that leaves Jiggly all alone.
Jiggly, you get to pick
which pair you'd like to join.
- [chuckles]
- Hell no.
- The pretty girls.
- [laughing]
- Say it again.
- Now, you've got 20 minutes.
Ready. Set.
Go.
- Run!
Give me that!
- Ooh, yeah.
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
Now we're cookin'.
- Jiggly, just get that done.
- This one's for Piyah, baby.
-<i> Okay, ladies.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Ugh, shit.
-<i> Time's up.</i>
- You just have to hold it.
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's see what you crafty
caterpillars have come up with.
The first headpiece is from
Milan and Latrice Royale.
- The basis of making
the headdress
is to make sure
that you can actually wear it.
- Yes.
- We failed.
-<i> From the house</i>
<i>of Sharon Needles</i>
<i>and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Yes.
- It's very royal wedding.
- Pop a little veil on there,
and you're ready for a funeral.
[laughter]
-<i> From the house</i>
<i>of Chad Michaels and Willam,</i>
<i>very tasteful number there.</i>
Is it fly, girl?
- Don't be trying to mop it.
- From the house of Dida Ritz
and The Princess.
I could see Mariah Carey
selling this on HSN.
[laughter]
And last and certainly
not least,
<i>from the house of</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara, Kenya Michaels,</i>
and Jiggly Caliente,
it's a butterfly extravaganza!
- So we wanted something
that was gonna be
as big and as beautiful
as her spirit
and represent her as a whole.
- Love it.
So I will consult
with the client.
Tell me, dahling.
Okay. All right.
And the winner of this
mini-challenge is...
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly.
[cheers and applause]
<i>Let's see how it looks</i>
<i>on Piyah.</i>
- [growling]
Beautiful.
- Gorgeous.
<i>- Ow!</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Piyah, your ride is here
to pick you up
like the queen that you are.
<i>Thank you, darling.</i>
-<i> Thank you.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Beautiful.
-<i> We can't wait to see</i>
<i>your next video.</i>
Music makes the people
come together.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll be producing and starring
in infomercials
<i>for my albums</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion</i>
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glamazon.</i>
You'll need to sell each song
based on a personal memory,
<i>like your first kiss</i>
<i>or your first time in drag.</i>
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly,
you won the mini-challenge.
<i>But, Phi Phi and Kenya,</i>
<i>you won the coin toss,</i>
<i>so you two will be</i>
<i>team captains.</i>
Phi Phi, you are Team<i> Champion.</i>
<i>Kenya, you're Team</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glamazon.</i>
All right, Kenya,
pick a queen.
- Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi, your turn.
- Sharon Needles.
- Yes, ma'am, Phi Phi.
- I'm not dumb.
[snickers]
- Miss Willam.
- Dida Ritz.
- Milan.
- Latrice the beast.
<i>[growls]</i>
- Princess.
-<i> All right, two queens left,</i>
<i>Jiggly and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.
- [giggling]
-<i> Again I got picked last.</i>
I thought that Kenya was going
to go through for me.
- And that means Madame LaQueer
is Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Oh.
- Going up.
- I gave a hand.
She rejected it.
- [grunts]
-<i> So are the people</i>
<i>going to see</i>
<i>that the Puerto Rican girls</i>
<i>in the competition</i>
<i>does not help each other?</i>
That's sad.
That is very sad.
- Ladies, my entire recording
career is in your hands.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best...
seller win.
- I want us each to have
a completely different look.
<i>I want to appeal to everybody.</i>
I want to be completely ghetto.
Can you do, like, gospel?
- Yeah.
- I could be very girly.
- Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna be honest with you.
You've done girly every time
that you've tried to do
something.
I don't want you to do girly.
Can you do, like, club kid?
- Yeah, I could do that.
- I'm kind of channeling, like,
my character being a housewife.
- I want you to look
very Stepford wife.
I want you as, like--
as gothic as can be.
I think you doing your
goth thing would be perfect.
-<i> As much as I love being</i>
<i>a horror character,</i>
as a drag queen, there is
a million looks inside me.
- Boom. Boom.
- Our challenge today
is to make a infomercial
to sell RuPaul's albums
<i>Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Champion.</i>
I have a killer pimple,
and I did not know this.
<i>So we had to make testimonials</i>
<i>depending on which song</i>
<i>we were assigned.</i>
<i>We had to have choreographed</i>
<i>dance, make costumes.</i>
Do you have any
plastic necklaces?
- Um, I have, like,
one turquoise one.
You want it?
-<i> Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>
It has to be, like, darker.
<i>Each team got assigned</i>
<i>a different album.</i>
<i>So we got</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion.</i>
Are you guys gonna start
getting ready or not?
- Well, do you want to start
doing choreography
and everything?
- Oh, yeah, we have to do
our choreography.
Fucking shit.
- Girl.
- It's only a little snippet.
- Have you listened to it?
- Oh.
-<i> It's every song off the album.</i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- An hour and a half
to do choreography,
plus do the costumes,
plus pick our pictures
and memorize this song
and do a dance?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh.
God!
- Get into it, girl.
Get into it.
- We can't do this.
We can't let this break us.
Come on.
-<i> Phi Phi is the team leader.</i>
<i>Definitely, there was a lot</i>
<i>of pressure.</i>
We say the captain goes down
with the ship.
-<i> Do y'all's face, like,</i>
<i>super fast,</i>
<i>so that way, we can rehearse</i>
<i>afterwards.</i>
- Can everybody be painted
in 30 minutes?
- In 30?
- Mm-hmm.
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
-<i> Phi Phi wants to call me goth</i>
and wants to push me
into one small box,
which is a box she knows
nothing about.
- [gasps]
Oh, Jiggly!
You should do<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and do a whole Asian theme.
<i>And then you can wear</i>
<i>my red bob.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
- So hurry up and get painted
and just look super Asian.
Oh, so don't put any makeup on.
-<i> Stupid.</i>
-<i> I just felt like I was</i>
<i>in the team of the busted.</i>
And I wanted to be
in the team of the dusted.
- Okay, so what we need to do
is come up with a theme.
- Maybe we try to put<i> Glamazon--</i>
our animals, our fears, costume
to that first and--
- Yeah, but because
of our time frame,
we got to make sure
that everybody
can get something
that's universal.
Let's just decide to go on '80s.
<i>I think we all knew that Kenya</i>
<i>had a language barrier.</i>
So I decided to take control of
that situation and help Kenya.
- We have to pick
our individual backgrounds
for our individual performance.
- Okay, great.
Can you find humor in that?
You know what I'm saying? Like--
- In clouds?
- Yeah.
- Kenya is supposed to be
the team leader,
but Milan is stepping in,
and I'm sorry.
I don't think
it's the language barrier.
- '80s is about this.
You know, it's about this.
It's about, "Ha, ha, ha."
- The first position
for the<i> Superstar.</i>
What is the first position?
- It's, um...
- And next--next--
- Let me sing through it.
I'll try to sing
as much as I can.
-<i> Milan kept talking over Kenya.</i>
- Maybe I--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
- It's getting old.
It's getting real damn old.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, RuPaul.
all: Hi!
- I want to know how my
infomercials are coming along.
- Come, Mother, come.
- Well, hello, Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi.
- Willam, what song
are you gonna do?
- I get to do<i> Click Clack.</i>
- And you're a shoe queen,
aren't you?
- I brought 34 pairs of shoes.
- [mouthing words]
- I have some great '80s shoes.
- Is the whole group
dressing '80s?
- Yes.
- So, Captain Kenya,
how did you decide on '80s?
- Personally speaking, I think,
as you listen to the album,
there's some '80s influence
going on.
We wanted to try to stay true
to the essence
and the influence of the album.
- Kenya?
Who is in charge here?
<i>Is it you or Milan?</i>
- We decided to share it.
- Yeah.
- Because, you know,
of the language barrier.
- Right.
-<i> I think that Milan</i>
<i>talked too much.</i>
The English is not
my first language.
<i>But I'm trying.</i>
- Princess, you've been known
here on the show
as sort of the quiet one,
the Zen one.
- Right, right.
- How are you gonna
put it all out there?
- I think I just haven't been
given the opportunity
to do that.
- Well, I don't know about that.
We've given you
a few opportunities.
You have an opportunity
right now to do it.
-<i> It just sucks to hear</i>
<i>that criticism,</i>
when I've been giving it
my 100%.
<i>It just boggles my mind.</i>
- Well, well, well.
Team<i> Champion.</i>
all: Hi, Ru.
- Phi Phi, you're captain again.
- I am captain again.
- How'd that happen?
- I'm just amazing.
-<i> You are amazing.</i>
- [giggles]
- So, Sharon Needles,
what song are you gonna do?
- I'm going to be doing
<i>Cover Girl.</i>
-<i> Cover Girl?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
I'm going to be pitching it
to an alternative audience
who might think your music is,
uh, too dancy.
- Wait a minute.
Ex-squeeze me?
- Well, it is very dancy,
but it also, you know,
has other elements to it
that I think works
for all audiences.
- Uh-huh.
Dida.
What song are you doing?
- I'm doing Stepford wife
dancing to RuPaul's<i> Main Event.</i>
And when she hears this song,
it reminds her of the fun
that she had.
- Ah.
So maybe she was a<i> Solid Gold</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dancer in another life?
- Maybe; maybe she was one of
a pole dancer back in the day.
- [laughing]
- Jiggly Caliente,
some of your teammates
gave you a little shade
on the runway last week.
Why do you think so many people
chose you as the person
who should go home?
- Probably because they still
<i>don't understand everything</i>
<i>about me.</i>
They'll have to get
to know me first.
- When will they get
to know you?
In this competition, if you
really want to really go for it,
it's not something to do
with anybody else.
It's got to come from yourself.
I want to ask,
have you guys had time
to work on your
group number yet?
- No, we haven't.
- We wanted to paint first.
- Oh, dear.
Are you a little worried
about the group number?
- No, we're not worried.
- I am.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- We looked like fucking idiots.
<i>It was embarrassing to me.</i>
- You don't want to get clocked
by RuPaul.
You don't want to get clocked
by Supermodel.
You don't.
You don't.
- All right, you all need
all the time
you can get your hands on.
Now, I'm gonna let you all
get to it, okay?
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, bye.
<i>Ladies, gather round.</i>
Remember, you need to connect
with the TV audience.
<i>Make 'em laugh.</i>
<i>Sell some product.</i>
And pitch your heart out.
Oh, and one more thing.
Don't fuck it up!
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Here they are, Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
-<i> The infomercial challenge</i>
<i>is kind of daunting</i>
because we're doing
lots of different segments.
<i>There's different outfits</i>
<i>to think about.</i>
- We have props for you
if you like.
There's some Iron Fist shoes
which I designed,
<i>and the pit crew</i>
<i>is also included.</i>
You just got to return 'em
when you're done.
[laughter]
-<i> We're shooting the opening</i>
<i>scene of the infomercial.</i>
<i>Our team looks phenomenal</i>
<i>in our '80s looks.</i>
And we are so ready to do it.
We're gonna do amazing.
-<i> All right, here we go.</i>
Action.
[tango music]
- Do the line.
Do the lines.
-<i> Cut.</i>
Now, I know you flubbed
a little bit,
<i>but that's okay;</i>
<i>that's okay.</i>
Just keep on going.
- Hey, Chad.
Is that RuPaul's<i> Glamazon?</i>
- Oh, my God.
It takes me so far back.
- RuPaul's music--
Oh, fuck.
Order all your favorites
and hits now.
The pit crew is standing by.
- Uh, you read the--
the line wrong.
- Yeah, it's "Order now."
- Order now.
- "Get all your favorite hits.
<i>The pit crew is standing by."</i>
- Nobody gets their line right
the first time.
Order now, and other
favorite hits.
The pit crew is standing by.
- All right, who's up next?
<i>You tell me when you're ready.</i>
- [sniffs]
I'm ready.
- Action.
[synthesizer solo]
<i>Milan is up next.</i>
- Before I listened to RuPaul's
<i>Superstar,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I was so emotional.</i>
But after listening to it,
I found out that the greatest
love of all is inside of me.
[sudden silence]
-<i> You know, that's another</i>
<i>artist, actually.</i>
-<i> I was gonna say, but you're</i>
<i>pitching Whitney there.</i>
-<i> Any bitch with common sense</i>
<i>knows you don't channel</i>
<i>Whitney Houston</i>
in a RuPaul infomercial.
- Thanks, Whitney.
We'll call you later.
<i>Look at you.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- She got bones.
-<i> [laughs]</i>
No, these are just bones
from some, uh--
-<i> A leopardasaurus.</i>
- Yeah, some Roberto Cavalli
animal or something.
-<i> Yes, from a yacht.</i>
-<i> Yes. Love it.</i>
<i>All right, here we go.</i>
Action.
Yeah, cut.
<i>All right, Team</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion.</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
<i>She got a 40-ounce.</i>
Girl from the 6 train.
- Now it's our team's turn
to do the infomercial
to sell RuPaul's album<i> Champion.</i>
- And...action.
Cut.
<i>Give it all you got this time.</i>
And...action.
-<i> I feel amazing</i>
<i>during the shoot.</i>
<i>Ru's laughing.</i>
<i>Michelle's laughing.</i>
I'm giving 'em, you know,
Phi Phi fierce the house down.
<i>Action.</i>
- When I first heard<i> Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my madam said,
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."
- Cut.
It's not what in your panties?
- Soy sauce.
- Oh.
<i>Sell it.</i>
<i>You got to sell it, okay?</i>
But that was--
that's--that's good.
- "That is not soy sauce
in your panties.
"That is happy endings.
Semen."
- [laughing]
Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- Action.
- When I first heard
RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl,</i>
I was covered in blood.
I was slaughtering
a sacrificial lamb.
- Cut.
The thing here is,
if it's supposed to be funny,
<i>make it funny.</i>
<i>Let's do one more.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Sure.
Phi Phi told me to do
just my spooky shtick.
<i>But they're just not really</i>
<i>getting it.</i>
-<i> You have one take left.</i>
Make it work for you, okay?
- Okay.
Though I may dabble
in the black arts,
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.
-<i> Cut.</i>
- [sighs]
This is a mess.
- One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,
and<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>
by RuPaul.
It reminds me of the main event
that happens in the bedroom
with my husband.
- So you're making a--
a sexual innuendo there.
- No.
-<i> I think you've got to sell</i>
<i>that a little bit more.</i>
- It reminded me
of the main event
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.
-<i> Cut.</i>
I like to go as far as possible
and have the director
pull me back.
-<i> Okay.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- You know?
- Okay.
This is bad.
I'm feeling nervous.
I'm feeling scared.
<i>I'm really screwing this up</i>
<i>right now in front of RuPaul.</i>
It reminded me of the main event
that was gonna happen later on
with my husband.
[giggles]
-<i> Okay, cut.</i>
<i>We'll see you on the flip side.</i>
[alarm buzzing]
- All right,<i> Mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Elimination day.
- Come on.
- No!
- I'm so nervous about today.
- Why are you nervous?
- Because I was terrible.
I'm just shaking in my boots
right now
and preparing myself
for the worst.
I just felt like I was working
with a whole bunch of amateurs.
- Sharon's scared because now
he's in the same boat
as all of us
and he doesn't have immunity.
- And the only reason
why he's scared
is 'cause he didn't steal
the show.
- I stole the show!
<i>I don't want to stress out</i>
<i>anymore</i>
<i>worrying about what Sharon</i>
<i>thinks of me.</i>
<i>I picked a character for her</i>
<i>that she can excel in.</i>
She has one good character,
so she might as well use it.
Bitch, shut the fuck up.
This is my team.
- Right.
- I feel like
I'm in high school.
"Can I sit by you?"
-<i> So have you met</i>
<i>your boyfriend's parents?</i>
- Never. Yeah, we've never met
each other's parents.
<i>It's like, our parents</i>
<i>don't mind that we're gay,</i>
<i>but it's like, they still don't</i>
<i>look at it as a real family.</i>
- My family was not very pleased
when they found out
that I did drag.
Not everybody.
Some people are very supportive.
Like, my mom and my stepdad
are amazing.
<i>They're absolutely supportive.</i>
Other people in my family are
not so thrilled with it.
My dad found out
I was doing drag.
He wrote me a letter and said,
"You're an embarrassment
to the family.
Change your name.
Move far away."
Basically didn't want any
contact with me whatsoever.
It's tough when people
that you love
don't agree
with what you're doing.
- It sucks. It sucks.
I haven't spoken to my parents
in I don't know how long,
really,
<i>and they don't know I'm here.</i>
- Wait, they don't even know
you're here?
- I come from a very, you know,
religious background.
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be proud of me.</i>
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be embarrassed by me.</i>
I just feel like my family
just doesn't understand
<i>the fact that I do what I do,</i>
<i>and it's kind of put</i>
this distance between us.
I never make an effort to even
try to pick up the phone
and call them
because I don't like to go home.
- We both lost our mom just,
you know, four years ago,
and tomorrow's not promised.
Just don't put that wall up,
because you will regret it.
And I have to live with the fact
that I didn't see my mom
for over ten years.
- I don't want to, like,
get this phone call that, like,
something has happened
and know that, like, the last--
the last, like, time
I spoke to my mother
was--you know,
and how my feelings were.
- You only have one family.
-<i> [laughing]</i>
[applause]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
-<i> Hey, gorgeous.</i>
- Hey.
- Whoo!
- Michelle Visage.
Hi, Mama.
- Hi, baby. How are you?
-<i> Great.</i>
I can see that you're
broadcasting in stereo tonight.
- Is there any other way?
- [chuckles]
<i>Hey, Santino.</i>
Or--or should I say<i> shalom?</i>
- Ha, ha.<i> Shalom.</i>
- How about the beautiful
and talented Amber Riley?
Welcome.
- Thank you.
I'm so excited to be here.
- We're excited to have you.
I'm a big Gleek.
- [laughs]
- And nine-time
Grammy award-winning artist
<i>Miss Natalie Cole.</i>
- Hello, love.
- This will be unforgettable.
- It already is.
- Good.
This week, our queens
produced and starred
in TV infomercials
to sell my greatest hits.
And tonight, they're ready
to take a spin down the runway
in platinum and gold.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
London, Paris...
Milan.
- Solid Gold<i> dancer.</i>
-<i> Darcel, her name was.</i>
-<i> And Altovise Davis, honey.</i>
-<i> I'm going for the gold, baby.</i>
<i>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</i>
<i>has nothing on me.</i>
-<i> She's gonna make your wishes</i>
<i>come true.</i>
-<i> You work it, girl. Work it.</i>
-<i> Ow.</i>
-<i> Harem scarem, Miss Thing.</i>
<i>Ooh.</i>
<i>Miss Chad Michaels.</i>
-<i> It's Jem and the Holograms.</i>
-<i> Fabulous.</i>
Solid Gold.
-<i> I just had the idea</i>
<i>to paint my forehead gold</i>
<i>and really try to emulate</i>
<i>the Versace medallion,</i>
<i>the Medusa head.</i>
-<i> Live from Caesars Palace.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>
-<i> The price of gold has just</i>
<i>gone up, hasn't it?</i>
-<i> Ooh, yes, it has.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Willam. Glamazon.</i>
-<i> Break these chains.</i>
-<i> My goodness.</i>
<i>Chain, chain, chain.</i>
-<i> My theme was</i>
Clash of the Titans,
<i>if</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Clash of the Titans</i>
<i>was set in a strip club.</i>
-<i> Oh, look, Willam's</i>
<i>a little cheeky tonight.</i>
-<i> Yes, I think I could see</i>
<i>her pink Cadillac.</i>
[laughter]
<i>All right, Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>She's Greased Lightning.</i>
-<i> Serving T-bird.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
-<i> Cha Cha Digregorio's</i>
<i>got nothing on us.</i>
-<i> I'm not afraid</i>
<i>to look bizarre,</i>
<i>and when I look bizarre,</i>
<i>I feel beautiful.</i>
-<i> She's serving Elvis</i>
<i>and Elvira.</i>
<i>She's Elvirus.</i>
<i>And it's contagious.</i>
<i>Oh, Phi Phi O'Hara. Yes.</i>
-<i> Vanessa Williams right here.</i>
-<i> Yes, yes.</i>
-<i> Sparkle, Phi Phi. Sparkle.</i>
-<i> I love my look.</i>
<i>My hair kind of looks swooped</i>
<i>like an ice cream cone.</i>
<i>Trying to serve the judges</i>
<i>Beyoncé-meets-the-Jetsons</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> She's serving Jiffy Pop</i>
<i>after the show.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
-<i> Madame LaQueer.</i>
-<i> Cut it out.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> Yes, she is serving</i>
<i>some space couture.</i>
<i>Yes, Mama.</i>
-<i> I'm going with</i>
<i>an outer space look,</i>
<i>and it's good because</i>
<i>I like to be different.</i>
-<i> Space: the final LaQueer.</i>
<i>The Princess.</i>
-<i> Uh-oh.</i>
-<i> Wait--uh--what?</i>
<i>- Uh--</i>
- She stole my look.
<i>Who wore it best?</i>
-<i> I like showing off my body,</i>
<i>my curves,</i>
<i>with an element of androgyny.</i>
<i>I definitely think it's a bold</i>
<i>choice to go without a wig.</i>
-<i> Bold is beautiful.</i>
-<i> Yes, it is.</i>
<i>Look at that ass.</i>
-<i> I'm telling you.</i>
-<i> Your ass is mince, Princess.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> Jiggly Caliente.</i>
<i>Serving heavy gunmetal chick.</i>
-<i> There's an asteroid headed</i>
<i>straight for planet Ru.</i>
-<i> Uh-oh. Duck and cover.</i>
-<i> The look is right.</i>
<i>Catch my shades.</i>
<i>I look sick.</i>
-<i> I said wild women do.</i>
- Amen.
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> And they don't regret it.</i>
-<i> No.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
<i>Oh, runway realness.</i>
<i>Supermodel.</i>
-<i> Look at these legs.</i>
<i>I'm pummeling the runway.</i>
<i>I am serving Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> Oh, and what an impressive</i>
<i>bumper she has.</i>
-<i> And she ain't afraid</i>
<i>to show it.</i>
-<i> No.</i>
<i>- Not at all.</i>
-<i> Latrice Royale.</i>
<i>There's gold</i>
<i>in them there hills.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> I want this short little dress</i>
<i>to show off my gorgeous legs</i>
<i>and hips and curves.</i>
<i>Body beautiful, of course.</i>
-<i> 24-karat realness.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>I'll have a Latrice Royale</i>
<i>on the rocks.</i>
<i>Shaken, not stirred.</i>
<i>Kenya Michaels.</i>
<i>She's serving</i>
<i>some R2-D2 realness.</i>
<i>"C-3P-ho."</i>
-<i> I tried to mix the high</i>
<i>couture with the fantasy.</i>
<i>I feel amazing.</i>
-<i> In space, no one can hear you,</i>
<i>queen.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
- Welcome, ladies.
<i>It's time to debut your</i>
<i>RuCo Records infomercials.</i>
Let's start with Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Hey, Chad.
Is that RuPaul's<i> Glamazon?</i>
- Like, oh, my God, wow.
That takes me so far back.
- RuPaul's music brings back
so many good memories.
It's hard to choose just one.
- You know what, Princess?
Luckily, you don't have to.
Oh, my God!
- Before I listened
to<i> Superstar,</i>
I was totally spastic.
But now that I listened to it,
I feel totally tubular.
- [Hispanic accent]
Hello,<i> Papi.</i>
I don't speak very much English.
[speaking Spanish]
<i>Y</i><span style="bodyStyle"> trust me.</i>
Do you remember your first time?
- Oh, my God, you guys.
The first time I heard
RuPaul's song<i> The Beginning,</i>
I was spray painting
my ex-boyfriend's car
with vulgarities.
What a jerk.
That was the beginning
of an awesome
and gnarly new life for me.
- When you are in a competition
that no one speaks Spanish,
you think,<i> "Mierda,</i>
<i>no entiendo nada."</i>
But in that moment,
awake the beast.
Get your rebel on, and fight.
- Wearing high heels
was getting so ho-hum
until I heard<i> Click Clack.</i>
Now it's the soundtrack
to my life.
- Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?
At one time, I did too,
until I heard
RuPaul's<i> If I Dream.</i>
And now I know anything
is possible.
- Order now.
Get all your favorite hits.
The pit crew is standing by.
all: Get<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on Amazon.</i>
Whoo-hoo!
-<i> [laughing]</i>
<i>Ahh.</i>
<i>[Valley girl voice]</i>
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.</i>
Gag me with a spoon.
-<i> I think our team nailed it.</i>
<i>Perfect. Awesome.</i>
I don't think we could've done
anything better.
- Now let's watch the
infomercial for Team<i> Champion.</i>
[upbeat dance music]
- Hey, Vampira.
Isn't this, like, this, like,
uh, RuPaul<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album</i>
or somethin'?
- Oh, RuPaul's music
always brings me back.
- You know what, girl?
Like, there's so many songs
that, like, have so many
good memories
that it's hard to, like,
pick one, you know, Mamas?
- Luckily, now we don't have to.
[laughs wickedly]
- When I first heard<i> Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my madam said,
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."
- One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,
and then<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>
by RuPaul.
It reminded me of the main event
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.
- Children, when I heard
RuPaul's<i> Never Go Home Again,</i>
I know that there was something
out there better waiting for me.
- So look.
Every time I'm walking
down the street,
all these<i> mamis</i><span style="bodyStyle"> are like, "Ooh,</i>
girl, your ass is too fat."
I'm like, "Look, don't be
jealous of my boogie."
- When I heard RuPaul's
<i>Cover Girl</i><span style="bodyStyle"> for the first time,</i>
I was covered in blood.
And though I may dabble
in the black arts,
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.
all: Available on iTunes.
Whoo!
[loud cheers and laughter]
- That was dragnificent, ladies.
If I were watching back at home,
I would place my order
right now.
I mean, really.
Do it now.
<i>All right, ladies.</i>
<i>You produced</i>
<i>your infomercials as teams.</i>
But tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Milan.
Willam.
Latrice Royale.
Jiggly Caliente.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
This week, you did not reach
the top of the charts.
You are safe.
You may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent
this week's hits and flops.
And now it's time
to face the music.
Madame LaQueer.
- Hello.<i> Hola.</i>
- Let's go to Natalie Cole.
- I love your essence.
But I don't like the outfit.
- When I hear gold and platinum,
I think classier.
<i>The color green reminds me</i>
<i>of fungus.</i>
<i>In the video in the pitch,</i>
little bit too much Spanish,
so remember that.
- I think you were being true
to yourself, though,
with the Spanish.
<i>It was really funny.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thank you.
- But I think that that's a
place where you're comfortable.
I would encourage you to kind of
push yourself a little bit.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I think you're
an amazing actress.
I thought it was just
the right amount of trashy,
<i>tongue-in-cheek.</i>
- You do everything flawlessly
from beginning to end.
It's obvious.
I want to see you let go
of that perfection.
I want to see more
of who you are.
- Princess.
Love the look.
- Thank you.
- Your hosting skills
weren't really
at the same level
as Chad Michaels'.
- You were extremely flat.
We've told this to you before.
You've got to be aware
of going above and beyond
<i>and out of your comfort zone.</i>
You in particular, Princess.
- Kenya Michaels.
- Hi.
- You come out here
in this directional ensemble.
<i>I was just, like,</i>
<i>following every curve.</i>
- I really loved
your performance.
It was so sick
that it was right.
-<i> Thanks, Kenya.</i>
Dida Ritz.
-<i> Hey, Dida.</i>
I love your ensemble tonight.
<i>Your body is amazing.</i>
I wondered why you chose
<i>the character you played</i>
<i>in the video.</i>
-<i> I wanted to do</i>
<i>something different.</i>
Tall, leggy, sexy Dida
is kind of something
that I don't want
to get comfortable doing.
- It's good that you did
take a risk,
<i>but you looked uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and if you're gonna</i>
do something out of your
comfort zone,
you have to commit to it.
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
<i>Tell me about your</i>
<i>infomercial presentation.</i>
Did you work well with Phi Phi?
- She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
<i>Basically, what she said is,</i>
<i>"You're spooky.</i>
Dress like a monster."
But I used it as a way
to sell your records.
- Well, you do spooky very well.
- Boo.
- [whimpering]
- I didn't even get
the name right away.
[laughter]
It just went whoop,
right over my head.
- All in the past, Miss Cole.
- Okay.
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.
- Well, yes, um--
- [laughing]
-<i> The presentation was eerie</i>
<i>and all that you wanted it</i>
<i>to be.</i>
<i>It kind of freaked me out</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>
I really liked it.
-<i> I love that Swarovski crystal</i>
<i>pompadour you got on.</i>
But I wish I couldn't see
the lower half of your body.
It kind of looks like
a store-bought thing.
-<i> Well, ladies, I think</i>
<i>we've heard enough.</i>
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between
us girls, who is your favorite?
- I go with personality.
-<i> Yeah.</i>
-<i> I think that Sharon Needles</i>
<i>has got a great sense of humor.</i>
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
- For me, it's between
Sharon Needles
and Kenya Michaels.
<i>I really like Kenya.</i>
She has less of a handle
on the English language,
but she was able to just
push through it
and just have fun.
- Yes.
She sold it.
It was from the heart.
You felt that she wanted
to bring out the inner beast
and get her rebel on.
- Chad is my absolute favorite.
<i>She's so glam and so seasoned.</i>
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
<i>I just kept staring at her</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
Now, here is the hard part.
Who are the bottom two?
- You know, I would kind of
have to say
<i>Princess and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Princess and Madame LaQueer.
And why?
-<i> Madame LaQueer, she's just</i>
<i>not quite ready for prime time.</i>
And although Miss Princess' look
is great,
we're talking about bringing
people that are gonna win...
- Yes.
- Because they're already
so close.
I don't think she's that close.
- The Princess--I'm getting
nothing from her.
I think I'd like to see more
from Madame LaQueer.
She's a fierce queen.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have to say Dida.
<i>I just don't know.</i>
<i>I'm confused by her 'cause</i>
<i>the walk on the runway--</i>
That walk is saying,
"I am here. I am fierce."
<i>But the video--</i>
<i>I think Dida thought</i>
<i>that the costume</i>
<i>was gonna do the work for her.</i>
- Right, I don't think
she understands
<i>that that walk that she</i>
<i>displays on the runway</i>
can be transferred
into every challenge,
into her everyday life.
- I like to see people
who are the shit
and know they're the shit.
No apologies.
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
- No apologies.
- All right.
Silence.
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
Bring back...
my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Sharon Needles.
You went to the dark side...
<i>again...</i>
and delivered another
sparkling performance.
Condragulations.
- Yes!
-<i> You're the winner</i>
<i>of this challenge.</i>
- Atta girl.
-<i> And you'll receive</i>
<i>costume jewelry</i>
<i>courtesy of</i>
<i>fiercedragjewels.com.</i>
- Who won the main challenge
this week?
Oh, yeah, me.
Again.
<i>Like a nightmare come true.</i>
<i>Ha, ha.</i>
I'm just such a loser back home.
It's--or that's
how I'm perceived,
and it's just great
to hear you say that.
<i>Thanks.</i>
- Sharon, you may step
to the back of the stage.
- Thank you.
- Chad Michaels, Kenya Michaels,
you're safe.
<i>Madame LaQueer...</i>
You're safe.
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
<i>The Princess.</i>
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both up
for elimination.
- Not again.
-<i> It's kind of upsetting</i>
because I felt like
I put myself there.
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
<i>Good luck.</i>
And don't fuck it up.
<i>[This Will Be</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
-<i> Natalie Cole is sitting</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>
<i>I have to do it for her.</i>
<i>I don't want her to leave</i>
<i>saying,</i>
<i>"That drag queen did</i>
<i>a horrible job with my song."</i>
- [laughing]
-<i> Yeah!</i>
-<i> Come on!</i>
Well!
Ah!
Whoo!
-<i> That is what a lip-sync</i>
<i>for your life is, baby.</i>
<i>That is high drag</i>
<i>at its finest.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
That was amazing.
I've made my decision.
Dida Ritz...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- That's the queen I want to see
from now on.
From now on, queen.
From now on.
- I promise.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
-<i> The Princess.</i>
Even though your time here
has been brief,
you will be forever
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royalty.</i>
Long live The Princess.
- Thank you.
- Now sashay away.
[applause]
-<i> I'm not the type</i>
<i>to get upset or angry,</i>
but I don't think it was right
to send me home.
This competition will definitely
be missing something
not getting to see the rest
of what I had to offer.
- My top ten, condragulations.
And the hits
just keep on coming.
Now, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, now,
let the music play.


- Charisma.
Uniqueness.
Nerve.
Talent.
We've raised the bar on grace
and beauty so high
that now there's
only one place to go...
[drum roll]
[cheering]
[yelping]
Over...
the motherfucking...
top.
- Let's not get it twisted.
- Hold on, bitch.
[camera clicking]
- More booty.
- Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison
for Ladies.
- Hello.
[dog barking]
- More sassy stars.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chicken-shit Gigs.
[laughter]
- More drama.
- [speaking Spanish ]
- Get out.
- Your fake-ass hoe.
- All right,
you tired-ass showgirl.
- At least
I am a showgirl, bitch.
Go back to Party City,
where you belong.
- For the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
and a finale,
we are breaking all the rules...
- Oh, my god.
- That will be the most
sickening ever.
- [gagging]
- Hey!
-<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
[laughter]
Is about to spin out of control.
- Pew, pew.
- In three...two...one...
- [snarls]
- [laughs]
My name's Willam.
I'm 29.
Ooh, a 26.
Damn, we got some big girls.
I hope they don't have diabetes.
I didn't come up
through the club system.
I'm an actor.
I've done TV, I've done film.
<i>Sex in the City, The District,</i>
<i>Criminal Minds,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and a show that was, like,
a multi-story arc.
I think I'm
the skinniest one; yay!
I'm a successful drag queen,
and not some bitch
who has to show for a dollar.
Now no one else can have it.
- My name's Lashauwn Beyond.
I'm 21 years old.
Hi, queen one.
- Hi.
- Lashauwn Beyond is the main
attraction for the circus.
She just has a lot of fun.
- Your hair's too big
for the frickin' door.
- I know, right?
- Hi.
- What's good, ladies?
My name is Jiggly Caliente.
I'm 30 years old from Queens,
New York, baby.
Wow.
Jiggly Caliente is New York
City's plus-size Barbie.
She got swag for your nerve.
You can't take her.
You look really familiar, Mom.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Oh, now I know who you is.
- You must have a television.
- Oh, hell no, you didn't.
- Well, hello, hello.
- Hi.
- How are y'all doing?
- How are you?
- Good, wow.
- My name is Phi Phi O'Hara.
I am 25 years old.
Are you guys excited
for the first challenge?
- No, we're not.
- You're not excited?
- Duh, yeah.
- Oh.
- [laughs]
- Hiya.
- [shrieks]
- I am Madame LaQueer.
I'm 29 years old.
- Your lips are amazing.
-<i> Perra.</i>
- Thank you.
- Give 'em here.
"Per--"
What does that mean?
-<i> "Perra"</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is like saying,</i>
"Oh, bitch."
- Sickening.
- Oh.
I'm gonna learn Spanish
by the time I win.
- What?
- Huh?
- Hey, there's a new girl
in town.
Let's get to business.
- Broadway just hit our stage.
That, or they picked up
a pimp off the street.
- Cash or credit card?
- My name is Milan,
I'm 36 years old,
and I'm from New York City.
Hey! Oh, my gosh.
Milan is fierce.
She is fabulous, she's a diva,
she can act, sing, dance,
produce, and you don't want it
from her.
[laughs]
- Hi.
- Hello.
How y'all trannies doing?
- Hi.
- Hi, wow.
- My name is Alisa Summers,
I'm 23 years old,
and I'm from Tampa, Florida.
I am definitely a fishy queen.
I can walk down a street.
You know, I don't really
get clocked.
People are looking more so
at how big my titties
and ass are.
I'm ready, girl.
[cheering]
-<i> Bonjour,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ladies.</i>
I'm Dida Ritz, I'm 25 years old,
and I'm from Chicago.
[screams]
Oh, my god, you're here!
Oh, my god.
Dida Ritz is--if you
think about Beyonce
and Carrie Bradshaw
and Kimora Simmons
and they all three got together
and somehow had a baby.
- Dida Ritz look a mess.
That dry-ass wig
and that awful-ass make up.
- Oh, my god.
- So we don't have any
backwoods girls yet, huh?
- Hello. Hi.
I'm the princess.
I'm 32 years old.
- You look sickening.
- Thank you.
I'm a reserved extrovert,
and I think
putting on the makeup
and the wig and the costume
unleashes her.
This is crazy.
It is so insane.
Wow, wow, wow.
- Hi, girls.
My name is Kenya Michaels.
I have 21.
I am from the island
of enchantment, Puerto Rico.
We are two Puerto Ricans.
- [laughs]
- Mama.
I'm a little person,
but I'm a fierce...bitch.
- What's her name?
- Huh?
Kenya.
- Kenya?
She's cute. Fuck.
Kenya looks fishy.
I was like,
"Crap, now I'm gonna have to be
the funny one
and not the pretty one."
- Morning, bitches.
Hey, everybody.
How y'all doing?
- Good.
- My name is Chad Michaels.
I am 40 years old.
- Shut the Cher show down.
Don't nobody do anything Cher
or Cher-adjacent.
- Yeah, 'cause
we're gonna have to row.
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.
Chad Michaels
is first and foremost
a celebrity impersonator.
That's my passion.
Cher has been what I'm most
well-known for.
This is my work outfit, baby.
- Cher comes to her for tips.
- [laughs]
I really do my best
to impersonate her with reality.
Like, you'll never see "ho!"
I will never do that
because she doesn't do that.
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- I'm doing all right.
- I immediately saw Cher,
so I want to see what else Chad
has to offer.
[cheers and laughter]
- My name is Sharon Needles,
I'm 29 years old,
and I'm from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
I look spooky,
but I'm really nice.
At least for now.
- My first impression
of Sharon Needles
was "Wow, what a whack job."
- Yes, the princess.
I'm the queen.
- The three words that would
describe Sharon Needles
are "beautiful," "spooky,"
and "stupid."
- Ow!
Eat it.
My name is Latrice Royale.
39 years of age.
- Hi, I'm Willam.
- Latrice.
- I'll hold your bag for you.
- Oh, I know you will.
[whoops]
Home team, home team.
- Miss thing came painted.
She had stones on her face,
and she was giving me all that.
- [delighted exclamation]
Latrice Royale is large
and in charge.
Chunky yet funky.
Wow.
Bold and beautiful, baby.
Mm-hmm.
Girl, the shade,
the shade of it all.
- The season four family.
- Look at this here, honey.
[cheers and applause]
- I want to know if I'm
the oldest bitch in the cut.
- You have to be.
[laughter]
[sirens]
[exclaiming variously]
- Girl, you've got she-mail.
[electronic sizzle]
We are living
in desperate times.
Birds falling from the sky,
dead fish fouling the sea,
once-fertile areas becoming
dusty, dried-up wastelands...
and that was just my last visit
to the lady doctor.
[laughter]
This is a test...
this is only a test...
to find out which one
of my girls
has the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
to snatch the title of America's
next drag superstar.
You are the hope
for future generations
of glamazons everywhere.
Ladies, tighten your tucks.
This is the beginning
of the rest of your life.
[progressively quieter]
Life... life...life...life...
life... life...life...life...
life...
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, hello, hello!
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Now, enjoy this moment.
Because it won't last for long.
Now, you've signed on
for a competition
that requires severe stamina
and devastating acts of beauty.
But if you dream big
and play to win,
it will all be worth it.
In addition to winning the title
of America's
next drag superstar,
the champion
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,
and headline
Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring Absolut Vodka:
cocktails perfected.
But wait, there's more.
- More?
- America's next drag superstar
will walk away
with a cash prize of...
$100,000.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god.
- When I heard $100,000,
I just wanted
to just pee on the floor
and start doing flip-flops.
- That's the good news.
But here's the bad news.
- Oh, here we go.
- Okay.
- You may need to spend
that prize money quickly
because, according
to the Mayan calendar,
2012 is the year the world ends.
This week,
you'll need to survive
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.
[distorted voice]
The Rupocalypse.
[cheers and applause]
- Bring it on, bring it on!
- Oh, wait a minute.
Somebody's missing.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Somebody is missing.
- 13, 13.
- 13, it's complete.
- I know.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god.
- I'm sitting on that box,
it ain't opening.
- I'm going to kick that box.
- All right, boys,
let me see what you got.
- Hallelu, I'm back, bitches!
[scattered groans and applause]
Yes!
I'm back, bitches.
- Oh, hell to the no.
It's time to make room
for new queens.
- New queens?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, what about you, Ru?
- Oh, bitch.
Oh, you know what...
[laughter and chatter]
Pit crew,
take this box out back,
throw in a rabid honey badger...
- Yes!
- Work!
- And set it on fire!
[cheers and applause]
- What about my money!
Hallelu!
- Bye.
- Hallelu. Hallelu.
Hallelu, love you, Hallelu.
Let that be a lesson
to all of you.
My show, my rules.
Now, are you ready
for your close-up?
[cheers and applause]
- Today we have
our photo challenge,
and RuPaul said that we should
be ready for the Rupocalypse.
I'm really, really excited
to see what's gonna happen.
- Hello, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I want you to meet
our favorite photographer,
Mike Ruiz.
Now, he's here to shoot
your totally toxic photo spread.
- Okay.
- Now, the pit crew
will be using their hoses
to spray you
with hazardous waste.
All of this while you spin
around in this toxic dump.
- I'm a soldier and I'm ready.
- All right.
- I want the queens
to embody the apocalypse,
but maintaining,
like, a lot of beauty
and fashion sensibility.
- Think Karen Silkwood, darling.
[camera flashes]
- Uh-oh.
- Electric storm.
- Find your li--
- Careful.
- Today just threw me
off balance.
And I was a little bit wobbly,
but I got through it,
got my bearings.
- Play to the camera.
- That queen is poison.
Dida Ritz.
- Beautiful, yes.
Give me, like,
crazy body shapes.
- You are a survivor, darling.
Grace Jones, darling.
- Beautiful.
- Give us toxic shock. Yes.
- Oh, beautiful.
To the camera, to the camera.
- Whoa!
- Oh.
You're traveling back in time.
- Back in time, darling.
- Kenya has such
a beautiful face,
but she does this really weird
thing with her mouth.
Her mouth is, like, wide open,
like she's trapping flies.
- Give it to Puerto Rico!
Beautiful.
Milan, find the camera.
- Don't cover your face.
Don't cover your face too much,
thank you--hold on!
- Ooh!
- You're spinning
out of control, girl!
- Yes.
Mahogany 2012, darling.
Sharon Needles.
- Hi, Ru.
- Did I meet you
at the free clinic?
- I think so.
I quit going.
It's so expensive.
- [laughs]
- Give me Chernobyl chic.
- Shocking beauty.
Give us some body.
- [yelps]
- Okay, now find the camera.
[yelping in slo-mo]
- Uh-oh.
- Topsy-turvy, topple over,
fatty.
And I'm like, "damn."
- Queen down!
- I couldn't let my fall
be the death of me.
- End of the world glamour.
That's right.
- Pucker your apoca-lips.
- We got it.
Alisa Summers,
give us the drama now.
- Yeah, just slide your hair
out of your face a little bit.
I want to see
that gorgeous face.
Yes, but beautiful.
You're not afraid,
you're giving me beauty.
- Aftershock.
Glow, baby, glow.
- How'd it go, mama?
- [sighs]
Spinning me all crazy.
- I've got get
out of my undergarments.
You're going to see
that I'm really
a 300-pound Latino here
in a second.
- Oh, man,
she said "300-pound Latino."
Sharon Needles.
She creeps me the fuck out.
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, my God.
I feel like I need
to pray the rosary
when I'm talking to you.
It was hard to have
a conversation and not cringe.
- Girl, look what this duct tape
did to me.
- Ooh, you did get
a little rug burn there,
didn't you, mama?
- The duct tape for what?
- I taped my titties up today...
- Oh.
- And because I
was in it for so long,
and it was pain--
I just ripped it off.
- Oh, my god, wait, come here.
- Look.
- You know, the stakes are high,
but damn.
- Give me all
of your Princess fierceness.
- I think the pit crew
just shot on your chest.
Princess of the apocalypse.
- Yes, tortured!
Make it severe.
- Yes.
- Like angry?
- No, not angry, beautiful,
gorgeous.
Uh-huh.
- Hello, vanity.
- Ooh.
- Only your beauty will survive
the apocalypse.
- That's right.
Make love to the camera
for the very last time.
- Beautiful.
- Tina Turner,
Lashauwn<i> Beyond Thunderdome.</i>
Madame LaQueer.
There's a hole in your ozone.
Now fill it.
- [panicked sounds]
- Give me beauty face.
Madame LaQueer
was giving me comedy face
when I really wanted
high-fashion face.
Give me beauty.
- The last cover of<i> O Magazine.</i>
It burns so good.
Let them have it, Latrice.
- [squawks]
- Oh, ooh, work it.
Yes, back to the camera.
A little sexier.
- I don't do photo shoots.
I don't like 'em.
I don't never know what to do.
I feel awkward and just, like,
"What do you want me to do?"
- Face-fuck the camera, Latrice.
- What?
- Cue the aftershock.
- Electroshock.
- [yelping and laughing]
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Queen down, queen down.
- Ooh.
[laughs]
- Were those your underwear?
- Wait a minute,
are those your panties?
- Ooh, yes.
- Keep spraying her.
- They're artificially
inseminating her
with that toxic waste.
Dr. Schwartz at your cervix.
Willam.
- Hi.
As soon as I walked in
and saw some body splatters
like a crime scene,
I'm like,
"Yes!
Some of these bitches fell."
Shoot me.
- Release the kraken.
- Remember to always--
- Ooh, careful.
all: Ohh!
- It ain't happenin'!
- Good save. Yes.
- There you go.
- You've saved the world.
- Go home.
Go home.
- [laughs]
- It was a total shocker
to see how these girls looked
as boys.
- Oh, my god, the princess.
I was like,
"Dude, you look
like a construction worker."
Latrice...she went from looking
like Aretha Franklin
to Biggie Smalls.
- Everybody's so tiny
without shoes and hair.
Y'all don't look
like such a threat no more.
- [laughs]
- Kiss my ass.
- Ooh!
Now, wait a minute,
let's all get along.
There's no fighting.
- Willam is getting
on my nerves.
Shut up, bitch,
and just go back in that box
where Shangela
popped out of and...leave.
- I just want to say
that I love everyone,
and can we all just get along?
- Shut up.
- Oh, what?
- She wants to get along
with everybody.
I don't know.
- Oh.
- Every one of you.
I love you all.
The first day,
at least just try to get along.
And wait till a bitch
steals something of yours
or sabotages you,
and then you can wreak.
But let's not walk in here
like you own the shit.
[cheers and applause]
Ooh, I'm not a virgin.
I don't want a virgin cocktail.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and greetings]
I don't know
who these people are.
- We're robbing you.
- Now, ladies, Mike and I
went over your totally
toxic photos.
One of you
was truly drop-dead gorgeous.
The winner of your very first
challenge is...
Jiggly Caliente.
- Yeah!
Yes!
Fat girl win the first
challenge!
- Con-drag-ulations, Jiggly.
- Thank you, mama.
- I love your totally
toxic photo so much,
I'm gonna tweet it tonight.
Hashtag Rupocalypse.
- [taunting singsong sound]
- Now, my queens,
I wish you sweet dreams
because tomorrow
is gonna be a living nightmare.
- Oh, shit.
She's going to put us
through something,
and it's not gonna be pretty.
- All right.
- Bye.
all: Bye!
- You won the first challenge.
- Whoo!
- Good job, boo, good job.
- Thank you.
- They brought us
to this old hotel
in the middle of a sketchy area.
And I'm like,
"What are they gonna do?"
- Ladies, I've invited you
to this godforsaken place
for this week's main challenge.
It's here that you will scavenge
among the ruins
to put together
a fabulous outfit
that screams
post-apocalyptic couture.
Now, you can use your own wigs,
undergarments, and shoes,
but the rest has to be looted.
Now, you're probably wondering,
"Ru, where am I going to get
all these materials?"
[laughs]
Well, you know what they say...
only three things will survive
the Rupocalypse:
Cockroaches,
Cher...
- Amen.
[laughter]
- And drag queen zombies!
- What?
[doors creaking ominously]
[snarling and groaning]
- The zombies
were scary as hell.
They got, like, guts coming out
and eyes popping out.
I'm like, mm-mmm, no, ma'am.
- When I saw the zombies comin'
after me,
I was about to hit it.
- [snarls]
- All right, you've got three
minutes to grab what you can.
And avoid being eaten alive.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman live.
[whimpers]
[zombies groaning]
- Give it, bitch!
- So I'm running around
in between these zombies
and I realize that they're
former competitors
from competitions past.
Shannel, Venus,
Morgan McMichael's, Delta Work.
- I got to see Akashia, Raven,
Pandora Boxx, Ongina.
- Drop it, bitch.
- Oh, maybe some--oh, oh, yeah,
you're not a zombie.
For a quick second, I thought
Chad Michaels was a zombie.
It's just that Halloween mask
of a face that she has.
- Mine.
- Give me that, give me that,
give me that.
No, no, no, no, no.
Bitch, bitch, you crazy.
I'm from new York, motherfucker.
- Oh, well, of course, a corset.
- Girl!
- I'm looking
for anything sparkly,
anything structured,
anything that I can glue
onto a costume that I create,
and then, after that,
I just start
grabbing everything.
- Sorry, girls.
- [screeches]
- Oh! Hi.
Oh, you're drop dead gorgeous.
Ooh, I dig the look.
Oh, no, honey, I'm on your side.
- When I saw the zombies
and then Sharon Needles,
I thought she probably felt
like she was at home.
- God, it's like
a family reunion.
Hey, sorry, sis.
- [screams]
Black people don't stand there
while zombies
are coming at them.
They run, bitch.
[screaming]
[snarling and growling]
[indistinct yelling]
[objects clattering]
- [screaming]
No, no!
[screams]
Oh, Hallelu!
Oh, Hallelu!
[munching sounds]
[emergency alarms sounding]
- Welcome back, girls.
[cheering]
- We get back to the workroom,
and there's more supplies
to help us with our outfits.
And everybody just went off.
- Can we flip this over?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- I grabbed it.
- We're like drag queen savages
who've been locked up.
We were just tearing each other
apart to get in these boxes.
- That shit's mine!
Everything in here is mine.
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.
- Thank god I'm good at math.
One small corset
plus another small corset
equals one fat-ass
corset, bitch.
[laughter]
[hammering]
- Get it, Lashauwn, get it.
- Going to break
that motherfucker.
- So Ru tells us
that we have to make
a "post-apopaloctic" outfit,
and I don't know
what that means.
It's the end of the world.
I sew for a living.
And I can't go down the runway
lookin' a fool.
- Yay, I got it.
- Lashauwn thinks he's Magellan,
splitting the earth in half
or something.
- I don't think art historians
would appreciate that.
- I don't know what she's doing.
Lashauwn might be going home.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Let's get this
end-of-the-world party started.
Hi, Princess.
Wow, what do we have here?
- I'm kind of going
for Rupocalypse
meets<i> Black Swan</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
meets the princess.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- How does this say
"end of the world"?
- Well, it's
kind of armor.
Like, if a ballerina
were preparing
for, you know, a comet.
- Mmm.
But I'm looking
for post-apocalyptic couture,
<i>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.</i>
- So after the comet
has landed, then?
- Yes.
- Okay, I got you.
I'm definitely nervous
about how much time
we have left.
I just need to rethink and redo.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Okay, cool.
- I can't wait.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Well, Sharon Needles.
- Hi, Ru.
- Wow. Tell me about this.
- I'm kind of going
for a Linda Hamilton,
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
trapped under the city
because of an impending
nuclear dust cloud, and--
- Now, I love all that,
but how are you
going to make that read
on the main stage?
- I am a little nervous.
I'm worried that the judges
aren't going to quite
get the look, but...
to get anywhere
in this competition,
you got to take a risk.
- I noticed you have a Tammy
Faye Bakker tattoo on your arm.
- I do.
She was a huge idol to me
as a kid.
I didn't even know
she was selling Christianity.
I thought
she was selling me makeup.
- [laughs]
All right, I'm going to let you
get back to work, okay?
- Okay, thank you.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Hi, Ru.
- What do we have here?
- Well, this is just a top.
And that's my hair.
I'm gonna make it
look explosive.
- That's your hair?
- Yes.
- Wow.
- I want to dye it,
but I'm still trying
to be couture and pretty.
- So the silhouette is gonna
be a traditional silhouette,
where it's a bustier
and a full bottom.
- I'm not too sure yet.
- You're not sure yet?
You know, there's $100,000
at stake here.
- I know.
- And you don't seem too worried
about the time here.
- I am, I am, I am.
- Huh.
Well, time is running out...
- You're right.
- For all of us.
- I know.
- You've got
a lot of work to do,
and there's $100,000
on the line.
- Stop reminding me. Oh, my god.
- Yeah, so...
- It's making me sweat.
- I'm not finished,
so I'm really feeling a certain
type of way.
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
Oh, Lord.
- You have got
to make it happen.
- I will.
- All right, thanks, Lashauwn.
- Take care.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, mama.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course, mama,
everything jiggles.
- [laughs]
Now, tell me about this
post-apocalyptic couture.
- This is my<i> Escape from New</i>
<i>York</i><span style="bodyStyle"> post-apocalyptic outfit.</i>
- Ah.
- So I need my solar panel
pieces
to make my lights light up.
- I don't see a real dress.
- I'm gonna wear a corset.
And I'm finishing that up
with some more...
garbage.
- All right, listen.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Yes, mama.
- So you just bring it.
- I will, definitely.
- Alisa.
- Hi, Ru, how are you?
- Hey,<i> mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Now, what do we have here?
- This is what I will be wearing
after the Rupocalypse.
- [laughs]
You are a breastplate girl,
aren't you?
- It's basically a swimsuit
with some titties on it.
- Hey.
- Hello.
- Now, you know
that the judges are...
let's just say they're
a bunch of bitches.
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?
- Oh, I'm so ready.
I'm sure that they're gonna
love it.
- Listen, you've got to bring
your game.
- Oh, I'm doing it, Ru.
- All right, get back to work.
- All right, Ru.
See you later.
- Latrice Royale.
- Well, hello, Ru.
- Sounds like a gorgeous
after-dinner cocktail, yes.
- Sweet and delicious.
- All right, honey.
Ooh, you're making me thirsty.
Now, listen, I've lived
a long time,
and I've had those years
where it felt like
it was the end of the world
as we know it today.
- Yes.
- What was your end-of-the-world
moment?
- Really, you really
want to know?
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...when I went to prison.
I went to prison.
Um, I made some stupid mistakes,
and I got 18 months in, uh--
in the hole.
And during that period,
I lost my mom.
- Mmm.
- And those were my worst two
fears come true.
That was a dreadful,
tragic year for me.
I couldn't even go to my
mother's funeral.
It was the most
degrading experience
I've ever had in my life.
But I'm a survivor,
I'm a fighter,
and I persevered
through triumph,
you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- I had a plan when I got out.
And my community
came to my rescue.
They had a "Get Latrice Royale
back on her feet
and on the stage" benefit.
- Wow.
- And it worked.
Now I'm on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
living my dream.
- I love it.
All right, kiddo.
Get back to work.
- Thank you, sweetie.
- All right.
All right, ladies, gather
'round.
Now, tomorrow, you'll make your
doomsday debut
on the main stage,
where we'll be joined
by our extra-special guest
judge,
one of my best girlfriends...
the mistress of the dark,
Elvira, will be here.
[cheers and applause]
- I'm so excited, I can't even
put it into words.
She's my idol since I was five
years old.
- Ladies, the human race
depends on you for the survival
of drag.
But if you fail, it's not the
end of the world.
Oh, wait a minute, it is.
So don't fuck it up. Bye.
all: Bye.
- Good morning.
Yay.
- Mama, what a mess.
- This is a freakin'
disaster area.
- Today is runway day.
It is elimination day.
It is all getting very real,
bitches.
- Someone's going home
today, girls.
- So, Lashauwn, how you feeling
about your look?
Is it coming along?
- To be honest with you,
I really don't know.
- What was Ru's feedback?
- I think she was really...
hinting that it wasn't enough.
- Uh-huh.
- You want to impress her.
- Absolutely.
- And I don't feel like I did.
- It's coming together.
It's gonna be fine.
Lashauwn is a little bit
on edge.
But you got to put the rooter
to the tooter at this point.
You've got to just sell it.
You crazy and creative
and outside the box.
You're always "beyond."
- I know you trying to let me
have it, too.
- No, well, as far as the looks
and the way you look,
it doesn't get any better
than this.
- Thank you.
- Okay, you better do it, honey.
- Talk to me, boo.
How you feeling?
- About the challenge?
- Yeah.
- Feel like everything
will be fine.
I just got to work it out.
- Well, you know, I'm a little
nervous,
but I think it's going
to be fine,
and I think that my mom
is going to be really happy
to see this, so...
- In 2007, I lost my mom,
and it was a rough year.
- If you don't mind me asking,
um, how did she pass away?
- My mom had an aortic aneurysm.
She had complications after
surgery.
And...she just...went down.
- What was your relationship
like with your mom?
- My mom was always there.
But me being a drag queen was,
like, one of the biggest
arguments we've had, 'cause she
never understood why I wanted
to do it so much.
The last few months that she
was alive, she did understand.
I was able to tell my mom
everything.
I'm angry.
When everything was
on the table,
I had three months with my mom
and...three months?
Like, damn.
- Your mother is here.
She's here...you know, and
just--just do what you need
to do and bring it.
- Are you nervous at all?
- Wait, are you trying
to read me
and tell me I should be nervous?
- Nah, it's cute for, like,
pirate couture.
- I changed my outfit last
night,
but today I'm feeling really
nervous about it.
- Are you upset that you had to
change your outfit?
- Ru just didn't like it.
She wasn't feeling it,
so I had to go more
post-apocalypse with it.
I was just so in my head about
it, about her being like...
"Nope," so I was like, "I'm just
"gonna--fuck it, I'm just
gonna change it all."
I took a risk in my look and I'm
freaking out, because if you
mess up, you go home.
- Okay, I'm going in on this
bitch.
- All right.
- You got an instant facelift
with this, dahling.
- What the fuck is that
on her head?
- I don't know what that is,
girl.
- The weakest out of everybody,
I would say, is Sharon Needles.
Sharon's outfit looks more like
a brown tube sock that she just
stretched out.
Looks like she got it at a
discount costume store.
She's not at that point, right
now, to compete, so, if
anything, I feel like she's
gonna be the first one
to go home.
- Can I just tell you, like,
I'm so glad that you're here?
- I'm so glad you're here, too.
- No, because I don't know
anybody else who does your drag.
- Right.
- You know, and I know that
some of the other queens are
just like, "Why is she here,
she's a freak."
- Really?
Well, they can think all they
want.
There's a million kinds of drag.
And it's not just being a fishy,
annoying girl.
- Yep.
- I think some of the girls
here, particularly the beauty
queens, might be looking at me
as just a freak.
And I want to show them that I
have everything that it takes
to win this competition.
And more.
- You are exactly the type
of guy that I go for too.
- Oh, stop it.
- Like, that whole, like, meth
look, like, that's...
- "Meth look."
- [laughs]
- Only I could take that
as a compliment.
- Have either of you ever been,
like, arrested or...?
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, yeah.
Um, I have a DUI.
The day I got my call to come
here is the--my last day that I
was--I was on probation.
- Really?
- Uh-huh, so it was like--that
was such a blessed day.
Over the last year I've been
dealing with a DUI.
It's just been such a struggle
for 15 months.
I've been without being able to
drive.
It's hard for me to keep a
regular job.
They arrested me in drag.
- No!
- Biggest fear ever.
- Oh, okay, I thought--
- In handcuffs, in full paint,
full body, everything.
- I kind of would like that,
though.
- No.
They made me undress in front of
a room full of people
they had arrested.
Like, nobody would touch me.
They ruined my life
for 15 months,
but it's over now, and my life
is about to change.
I'm ready for the whole country
to know who Alisa Summers is,
and I hope they're ready for me.
- I just feel like my stuff
needs more.
- I'm worried that they're not
gonna get it.
Honestly, I think you better
create a really good story
for it.
- Okay, what I'm gonna say is,
<i>"Escape from New York--"</i>
ooh, shit, it's falling apart.
- Yeah, that's not good, either.
- Yeah.
- Jiggly's costume is a hot
mess.
It's all hot glue and scissor
work.
It's just like an explosion
of aluminum foil.
- Baked potato couture.
- You look like you're ready to
bake at 350.
[laughter]
[applause]
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Well, look what the zombies
dragged in.
Michelle Visage, you're back and
better than ever.
- Don't you know it, my lovely
lady in red.
- Mike Ruiz, I'd stop the world
and melt with you, darlin'.
- Oh, here we go again, Ru.
- [laughs]
Sometimes it's champagne,
sometimes it's pretzels
and beer,
but Santino's still here.
[laughter]
- And the eternal beauty,
mistress of the dark, Elvira.
- [gasps] Me?
- Hey, girl, you're gonna put
somebody's eyes out
with those things.
- [gasps] I hope it's not yours.
- [laughs]
Now, this week I asked our
queens to rise from the glittery
ashes and blow us away with
their post-apocalyptic couture.
Are you ready to see what's on
the other side?
- Bring it.
- Yeah.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- First up, Willam.
- Not Willem Dafoe.
- No, not Willem Dafoe.
- And not Will.I.Am.
- Not Will.I.Am.
- Very Westwood, too.
Only one boob, though.
- Yeah, the other one got lost
in the apocalypse.
- As I'm walking down
the runway,
I'm trying to give them some 90s
supermodel.
Ass, ass, titties, hair, hair,
gas mask.
- Cloudy with a chance of acid
rain.
- I like the gas mask on the
back of her head, it's very
two-faced.
- Willam's a real gas.
[laughter]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Two queens enter,
one queen leave.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is that a dream catcher
covering her private parts?
- Yes.
- [laughs]
- I knew I looked fierce,
I knew that my outfit could not
be touched.
I felt like all the attention
was on me.
I was just ready to serve it to
all the judges.
- I think that's a honey badger
on her shoulders.
- Maybe we do need another hero.
- We might just need another
hero, Santino.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Oh!
- Fabulous.
- Lashauwn be hot.
- Yes, ma'am.
She's got the whole world on
her...head?
- I thought a giant chicken laid
an egg up there.
- I live for what I put down the
runway.
I had the world on my head, and
my "post-apoc-oloptic" couture
costume.
It was sickening.
- Now, I wonder if she can get
cable TV with that on her head.
- [laughs]
- Chad Michaels.
- Okay.
- Oh.
- Ooh, how chic.
She could walk a mile for
a camel toe.
- Real fish caught in the net.
- I'm a perfectionist.
It's something I pride
myself on.
I'm feeling very confident.
I love what I'm wearing, very
post-apocalyptic diva, and I'm
feeling really, really good.
- Very "Lawrence of my labia."
[laughter]
- Up next, The Princess.
- [gasps]
- Wow.
- Wow, clown slippers.
Looks like a life jacket.
- Yes, queen overboard.
- I'm giving the judges
<i>Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> couture.</i>
I feel like I'm really living
for what I'm serving.
I love it.
- In case of emergency, your
scarf can be used as a flotation
device.
[laughter]
Kenya Michaels.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
- She's a phoenix rising from
the ashes.
- That's right.
- That's it.
- Firebird.
- Walk that walk!
- [squawks]
- I feel amazing.
I'm feeling fire, I'm<i> fuego!</i>
That moment I remember for all
my life.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Lil' Kim in the house.
- Something's sprouting back
there.
- Her garden is in full bloom.
- Latrice Royale.
- Yes, she is.
- Whoo!
- Ooh, it's Latrice
from Whoville.
- Yes, mama.
- I'm Latrice, so of course I
stomped it on out, and I'm
givin' big girl sexy, showin'
all my curves and swerves, and
givin' a little face, givin' a
little attitude,
and a lot of ass.
- Yes, beyond thunder thighs.
[laughter]
Serve, honey.
- Mm-hmm.
- A queen for all seasons,
Alisa summers.
She's got goggles up there.
- Apparently,
she's going skiing.
- Ooh, I hate when drag queens
have bigger boobs than me.
- I'll say.
The hills are alive.
- I'm givin' them sexy, I'm
givin' them dominatrix, and I'm
on top of the world.
There's no feeling like that,
ever.
- And she's an all-terrain
vehicle.
- Yes.
- She a ATV summers, all-terrain
vajay-jay.
- That's right.
- Oh!
[laughter]
- Paris, London, Tokyo, Milan.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- This is an infected Betsey
Johnson, right?
- Yes, it is.
-<i> Love is a Battlefield.</i>
- I'm serving the judges
savage beauty.
I'm feeling ferocious.
- I'm ready to attack.
- Milan is burning.
Now, let this be a lesson to all
of us--don't smoke in bed.
[laughter]
- Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
- Oh.
- Look, she's got a leg up on
the other girls.
- Yes, she does.
Apparently, hoarding is the new
black.
[laughter]
- I'm here on the runway, and
my adrenaline is on fire.
Everything is pulsating through
me, and I'm like, "Oh, here we
"go, bitch, I'm gonna show you
plus-size supermodel."
- She's one hot potato.
- And she seals in her natural
juices.
[laughter]
- Dida Ritz.
- Work.
- Come on, girl.
- Yes.
- Ooh.
- Chocolate Barbie doll.
- Legs for days.
- I'm doin' my runway,
it's sickening.
I am definitely channeling
Naomi, I am channeling Giselle.
I'm feeling it.
- You know, everything tastes
better when it sits on
a Dida Ritz.
- With thighs like that--
- You better ass somebody.
- Crack is whack.
- Oh, Madame LaQueer.
- Looks like my leftovers
last night.
- Give her an inch, she'll take
a foot.
- Take that, Betty Rubble.
- I'm serving attitude and I
feel so great, like I have never
felt before in my life.
- The entree of the evening,
filet of sole.
- Mmm, goes great
with some toe jam.
- Mmm.
- Ew!
- All right for Sharon Needles.
- Ooh, look at those eyes.
- Nosferatutu.
- Oh, she's bleeding.
- A dead woman walking.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Zombies.
- Somebody call a dentist.
- I hope she's wearing
a dental dam.
[laughter]
- Coming down the runway, the
best part was slowly letting out
a giant mouthful of fake blood
all over my body, and that's
when I really saw Ru's
eyebrow raise.
It's a disco bloodbath.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- It is.
- Anyone told her
about fluoride toothpaste?
- Gingivitis never looked
so good.
Welcome, ladies.
Judgment day has arrived.
Now, based on your totally toxic
photo shoot and your
post-apocalyptic presentation,
I've made some decisions.
Will the following queens please
step forward.
Willam.
Milan.
Dida Ritz.
Latrice Royale.
Madame LaQueer.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
Chad Michaels.
Seven of you look like you've
been to hell and back.
Con-drag-ulations, you're safe.
- [exhales]
- Just safe?
My outfit was amazing, and not
"just safe."
- You may leave the stage.
Oh, ladies?
While you're back there, you may
want to think of ways to make a
more memorable impression
next week.
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's all.
Ladies, you six represent the
best and the worst of the week.
It is time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Lashauwn Beyond.
In the workroom you seemed
kind of nervous.
Do you feel
more comfortable now?
- No.
It's a competition.
I'm always worried, I'm worried
now, I'm nervous.
- America's next drag superstar
needs nerve.
She doesn't need to be nervous.
- I am impressed that she can
carry that giant thing
on her head.
I mean, I have this giant thing
on my head, and it's bad enough.
- [laughs]
- As a symbol I think it's
really great, of, like, a
strong, black woman with the
world on her head.
I love all the disparate parts
that you put together to create
this overall silhouette.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to the judges, Lashauwn?
- I'm just in disbelief.
- What can't you believe?
- That I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey, you better snap
out of it, you're here.
Play to win.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Up next we've got
Sharon Needles.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- How'd it feel up there
on the runway?
- Oh, I felt drop-dead gorgeous.
[laughter]
- This is my kind of ghoul.
I mean, I love the blood,
and this is a whole different
kind of take on drag queens.
- You know, everyone sort of
like survived the apocalypse,
and made do with what was left.
You took it one step further,
and you didn't survive
the apocalypse.
And then you came back to life
to terrorize these bitches.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Sharon Needles.
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, mama.
- Okay, no one's gonna
accuse you
of not havin' a great pair
of legs.
- [laughs]
- First of all.
But there's a little too much,
it's sort of like,
"Oh, my god, ah."
I'm getting my eyeballs
assaulted.
Just a little bit less could
have been more.
- Jiggly is a ball of energy,
and funny, and I love that.
- Thank you.
- But, girl, right now
you're a mess.
Things are fallin' off.
Fix your tutu.
I be seein' your privates
and stuff.
- No, girl, that privates
are put away.
- Jiggly, is there anything
you'd like to say to the judges?
- There's more, so much more.
- More than what you've got on?
- Well, but I'm talkin' about
all my clothes, all my drag,
when I wear it out here--
- We've heard that story before.
You have got to bring your
A game every single time.
There's $100,000 at stake.
- The time to bring it is every
single time you come out
to this runway.
Every single time.
- I will, mama.
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.
-<i> Hola.</i>
- So why a firebird?
- I really--she's a firebird
because if you're thinkin', uh,
end of the world, you're think
on fire, and I love that.
- You pounded this runway.
You came out, you were on fire.
I wish you had your wings with
you right now, because I'd like
to see the work you put
into them.
- You know that old phrase,
"Don't get your panties
in a bunch"?
- Yes.
- Your panties look a little bit
like they're in a bunch,
like a little diaper.
- My problem is, it doesn't
look really post-apocalyptic,
but I still think you're
beautiful, and you kill
a runway.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Kenya.
Next up, Alisa Summers.
Tell me about your outfit.
- I wanted to give kind of
a post-apocalyptic S&amp;M goddess.
- And tell me the significance
of the tool jutting out
of the areola.
- I like to shoot fire
out of my titties.
- Oh, okay.
- The boobices, where'd those
come from?
- What it is, it's like--it's
built like a swimsuit, and it's
just got the titties built right
onto it.
- I was getting scared.
I thought you were gonna say you
pulled everything up
from down there.
- From down here, all the way
up, yes.
- You've got some big ones,
girl.
And I'm feeling right now like
my makeup is looking natural.
- When you came out, I didn't
really see anything
post-apocalyptic
about your wardrobe.
It's not couture, either.
Even had you come out looking
like a big garbage heap, or
something, then there would have
still been more effort made,
to me, than what you have on.
- Who the frig says what
couture is, anyway?
I don't get it.
For him to say that's not
couture.
Well, it's couture to me, girl.
- [laughs]
- And I love how much makeup you
have on.
- Thank you.
- We kind of match.
- All right.
Next up, the princess.
- Nice outfit.
Who shot the lifeboat?
- It feels like it has a
nautical theme, a little bit,
to me.
- I'm kind of like Dennis Hopper
in<i> Waterworld.</i>
- I love that you approached it
from a nautical standpoint, the
world being consumed by water,
as opposed to fire and
brimstone,
which is what everyone else did.
- Thank you.
- You put together
a well-constructed look,
but there's no dirt, and you're
going through an apocalypse.
Like, it's completely--like,
your whites are whiter
than I've ever...
[laughter]
Done my laundry in my life.
- All right.
Well, girls, I think
we've heard enough.
- While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the interior
illusions lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
girls, let's start with
Lashauwn Beyond.
- I thought the outfit
was fierce.
I love the headdress, but she's
kind of uncomfortable,
she kind of
looks like she's at her first
prom, and--
- Yeah, what was that about?
- Eh, maybe she needs a couple
more years to cook, you know?
- I thought Lashauwn, more than
any of the other queens, really
met this challenge head on.
- There's definitely some skills
that are worth exploring,
but she definitely needs to
overcome her shyness.
- Yeah, it's cute for a taste,
but not for a swallow.
- Sharon Needles.
Now, I really dug her outfit.
It really told the story.
- It's obvious she's polished,
and she knows what she's doing,
but I want to see her in girl
drag, too.
- I love Sharon Needles.
It's hard for me to find
something bad about that.
- Jiggly Caliente.
Really funny, funny kid, but
that costume, I don't even know
where to start.
- She looked like she threw
everything but the kitchen sink
in there, but I think I saw
the kitchen sink in there.
- [laughs]
- It was the complete opposite
of the apocalypse.
- Right.
- But I'm so in love with her
as a person.
- Me, too.
- Kenya Michaels.
Cute kid.
When she walked down the runway,
she dazzled us with
those wings, but then she just
lost them.
- Yeah.
- She lost the most exciting
part of her outfit.
- I did have an issue with
the bedazzled diaper.
Not apocalyptic at all.
- No.
- But that bitch
is fierce.
- Alisa Summers.
- She's so stunningly
beautiful, I think she's used to
kind of resting on those
laurels, do you know
what I mean?
I think it threw her
a little bit.
You know, you need more
than beauty.
- I got to say, Alisa 's outfit
was very tacky.
- She built her whole costume
around that breastplate, instead
of using it as a detail within
some, like, grander, couture
sort of concept.
- Right.
- Right.
- Her outfit reminded me
of the worst movie in the world.
- What?
-<i> Showgirls.</i>
- Stop it right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mistress of the dark.
- I mean, my favorite movie.
- All right. The Princess.
- I loved the blue and
the orange together.
That was my high school colors.
- Go bears!
- I liked and appreciated her
overall look, but it wasn't
really post-apocalyptic.
I wasn't picking up
her references.
- You know, I immediately got
that<i> Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reference.</i>
I love the Pete Burns,
androgynous sort of vibe.
I think she's great.
- All right.
Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, which one of you bitches
will inherit the earth?
Lashauwn Beyond.
Your post-apocalyptic outfit
towered above the other queens,
but your personality fell flat.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
Jiggly Caliente.
Your totally toxic photo shoot
was winning, but your
post-apocalyptic couture was
an unnatural disaster.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- When Ru tells me I'm in the
bottom two, I want to die.
I know the outfit looks jank,
but damn.
- Sharon Needles.
You killed this bloody
challenge, and you really stuck
it to the other girls.
Con-drag-ulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
You'll receive immunity from
elimination next week.
- Thank you.
- Plus, a custom gown from
sequinqueen.com.
That's sequinqueen.com.
- I won the challenge today,
and I'm feeling ecstatic.
- [squeals]
I'll have my dress made
in black.
- Thank you.
- With a plunging neckline.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- All right, Sharon, you may
join the other girls.
The Princess.
Your<i> Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> inspired</i>
couture got a little lost at
sea...but I'm throwing you
a lifeline.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Kenya Michaels.
You pummeled the runway, but
your firebird didn't fly with
the judges.
Alisa Summers, your
post-apocalyptic showgirl left
little to the imagination, but
you were not "breast in show."
Kenya...
you are safe.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Alisa, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru says I'm in the bottom two.
It was just like, "really?"
I--I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync for your life.
- I am not givin' up my spot in
this competition, no way,
no how.
They have to pry this out of
my cold, dead hands.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I'm giving them face, I'm
giving them movements.
I'm feeling very confident.
- All I could think about is
"Kill it, kill it, kill it, hit
every move, hit every beat."
I have to pull out every trick.
If I have to shoot ping pongs
out of my ass, I will do it.
- Alisa is not turning it as
much as Jiggly is.
She's kicking, she's doing
choreography,
she's really turning the party.
She had marked her territory.
She shit On the stage.
- Jiggly started sheddin'
feathers and ornaments like a
Christmas tree that was gettin'
thrown out the window.
I was entertained.
I would-a given it some money.
- The whole number that Alisa
was doin' was slo-mo, girl.
This is called<i> Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not</i>
<i>Drag Walk.</i>
[applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Alisa Summers.
You are beautiful, talented, and
a queen for all seasons.
Just not this one.
Now sashay away.
- [whispering indistinctly]
- I definitely didn't think I'd
be the first person to go.
I definitely thought there were
other people more eligible to go
home before me, but I'm not
disappointed in myself.
I'm disappointed in what could
have been.
- Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Yes, mama.
- Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
The toxic 12, con-drag-ulations.
You live to die another day.
Now, remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" in here?
all: Amen.
- [laughs]
Now let the music play.

[cheers and applause]
Working with America's
fiercest drag queens
is bittersweet.
I'm thrilled when they're here,
but it kills me
when they sashay away.
Let's take a look
at some of the queens
who were gone too soon.
[cheers and applause]
[somber piano music]
- Eww!
- Welcome.
First up, Alisa Summers.
Now, were you surprised
that Jiggly sent you packing
with her sickening
lip sync and split?
- Did you see that outfit
she was wearing, honey?
When she was creating that
thing,
I was like, there is no way,
there is no way,
even if I'm bottom two.
Honey, but she turned it out.
But then again,
if I was wearing sneakers
I could have turned it out too.
[laughter and boos]
- Now, Lashauwn
and The Princess,
both of you were criticized
for being too low-key.
Do you regret not speaking out?
- I regret not speaking out
because I don't think
people got the chance
to really know who I was
and what I'm about.
So, yeah, most definitely
I regret it.
- Yeah?
And what about you, Princess?
- The only thing that I regret
is that the rest of America
didn't get to see what else
I had to show.
If I was more of a character,
say like Willam,
I probably could have
stuck around longer,
because, uh, I had more to show,
and frankly what came after me,
after I got kicked off
down the runway,
it was kind of lame.
[audience oohs]
- All right, now--
[laughter]
Madame LaQueer,
you won challenges,
and yet you were repeatedly
picked last
by your fellow queens.
How did that make you feel?
- Well, for a second
that made me feel bad
but in the moment that
made me feel in high school.
I get picked last
for the basketball team,
but, bitch,
I was a maid of honor.
Okay?
- Now, all of you
left the competition
before one of our favorite
mini challenges.
So I'm gonna give you a chance
to prove that
reading is fundamental.
[cheers and applause]
Madame LaQueer,
the library is open, darling.
[cheers]
- Jiggly Caliente.
I know I can call you Jiggly.
But, mama, where's your teeth?
I know, hanging out
with your good taste.
[audience oohs]
[applause]
- Ladies, stick around
because we've got
a lot more shade thrown
before we crown
America's next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
[techno music]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Tonight all my girls are back
to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
Now while our top three
are getting ready backstage,
I wanna talk to a queen
who became famous,
or should I say infamous,
for flipping her wig.
Let's take a look.
- That's a desperate
cry for attention.
- A little<i> I am what I am,</i>
<i>La Cage.</i>
- Milan, girl,
that's clearly a dude.
[cheers and applause]
- London, Paris, Milan.
You look great.
Now, have you done something
different with your hair?
Oh, no--oh, you're wearing it.
[laughter]
Now, I gotta ask,
I gotta ask,
now, were you surprised
by the uproar
over all the hair flipping?
- You know, to be honest,
I was a bit surprised.
I, um--I think that people
sometimes misinterpret
what I do as an artist.
At times you'll disagree,
and I respect that.
- So do you feel like
flipping your wig right now?
Let's do it together.
You first.
Ready?
Come on, come on, let's do it.
Come on, Milan.
Come on.
- For real?
- No!
- For real?
- No, thank you, Milan.
- Thank you, guys.
- Next up, when it came time
to put an outfit together,
this queen got Jiggly with it.
Let's take a look.
- The thing is,
I don't need to sew
to become
the next drag superstar.
- I don't see a real dress.
- I'm finishing that up
with some more...
garbage.
- Baked potato couture.
- Girl, right now you're a mess.
Things are falling off.
Fix your tutu.
- Where the fuck are my tits?
- It ain't the school for drag.
Let's face it,
she just took a bunch of pom-pom
and she just threw it on top.
It just looks horrible.
It looks horrible.
- Beyoncé don't be sewing
her shit.
[laughter]
- Hello, Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course, darling.
Everybody does.
- [laughs]
Now--now listen.
Now, your struggles with sewing
and design brought you down.
Have you been working on this?
- My brother gave me a gift.
Like, after his tax return check
came,
he decided--he decided to get me
sewing lessons.
So in a couple weeks I'm gonna
start my sewing classes,
and then I'm gonna turn it
the fuck out.
[laughter and applause]
- All right, so all right.
Let's talk about
your temper tantrums.
- I mean,
like I said on the show,
I kept it 100 all day every day.
- You kept it 100?
- All day--
- Not 95?
- Not 95.
100 all day every day.
And some people
just didn't like it.
And sometimes they took
my temper or my anger,
and there was just
so many issues I had
also coming onto the show.
When I got home,
I went to go get--
went to go see therapy.
I have serious daddy issues
and--
- Honey, don't we all?
Right?
- Well--
[laughter]
- Um, so the therapist told me
to write a letter, and I did.
- You wrote a letter to daddy?
- Yeah, I did.
But she didn't tell me that,
you know, to really mail it.
I mailed it,
and the right address.
So whoever gets it--
- Well, actually, I have
the letter right here, Jiggly.
- Oh, shit!
- No.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- All right, next up Dida Ritz.
Dida, during your time
on<i> Drag Race,</i>
you had a breakthrough
with your family.
Let's take a look.
- Surprise, Dida.
- [gasps]
- It's your mom.
- That's my mommy.
- Say hi, dad.
- Hi.
- We just wanted to let you know
how much we love you
and we miss you.
And we're really proud of you
for pursuing your dreams.
Love you!
See you soon.
Bye-bye.
- So, Dida, what's happened
since the show?
- Since the show, you know,
before my parents
never saw me in drag,
they'd never been to a show,
and now they watch the show.
My family is, like,
the biggest fans.
My mom calls me so much,
and she's always telling me
how my grandparents
watch the show
every time it comes on reruns.
And my mom's actually here.
- Is she here?
Your mother's here?
Oh, there--
may I call you Mama Ritz?
- Yes, you may.
- Now, in the clip we heard
your husband in the background.
What does he think about Dida
on television in drag?
- He's proud of him.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm, and he loves him.
- How does it feel
to get this acceptance
from your father
and your mother?
- It feels amazing.
You know,
every time I've seen you
I've said thank you
a million times
because you're bringing
happy homes together
and especially religious homes
together.
So I guess for me
it's a blessing,
and it's something
I feel very happy to have
because I know that there
are people out there
who don't have that, you know?
My mom's sitting here right now,
so...
- Yeah, yeah.
[cheers and applause]
Your parents are proud of you,
and so am I.
And like I always say,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
Bringing families together.
[laughter]
It's true.
Up next, little Kenya Michaels.
She had the looks, the moves,
but what the hell
was she talking about?
[laughter]
I mean, let's take a look.
[laughter]
- Mama, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
[roars]
Hmm, I kind of
like the smell!
- Kenya, you like the smell
of the beaver,
so don't hold your nose.
- This is a challenge
that you can go and kick ass,
because go, girl, smoke that.
That's my time, you know?
And it's more easy for you
than for me
that I don't speak more English.
It's the only thing that I say.
That's all.
- I understood
about four words of that.
- Whoo!
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, little Kenya.
Hello.
Now, my dear, sometimes it was
difficult to understand...
- I know.
- But tonight
we don't want to miss a thing.
So we've invited
an extra special translator.
Please welcome our biggest
drag professor, Charo.
[cheers and applause]
- Hola.
- Hola.
- Hello, Charo.
Now, Charo,
I need you to ask Kenya
how has everyone in Puerto Rico
responded
to her appearance on our show.
[laughter]
- Right.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- [speaking Spanish]
[both speaking Spanish]
- Si?
- Ah, yeah.
- [speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
[continues speaking Spanish]
[both speaking Spanish]
- Si, si.
- [continues speaking Spanish]
- Si, si.
Um...
[laughter]
Well, I tell you what, Charo.
Let's ask her one more question.
Please ask her
if she was surprised
that we brought her back
to the show.
- Right.
[speaking Spanish]
- Jodera...
[speaking Spanish]
I'm so excited, girl.
[speaking Spanish]
Baby, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
[cheers and applause]
- Right, I kinda understood
the last part, but could you--
could you translate the first
part of that, Charo?
What'd she say?
- RuPaul, I'm very confused.
I cannot understand
a word that bitch say.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Well, Kenya,
you are a fierce queen
in any language.
And, professor Charo,
so are you.
[cheers and applause]
Kenya, do you cuchi-cuchi?
- No, can you show me, please?
- [speaking Spanish]
- Actually, let's everybody
cuchi-cuchi out to commercial.
[upbeat music]
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Now, before we crown
America's next drag superstar,
there's an important
piece of business
that we need to attend to.
This season, for the first time
in Drag Race history,
a queen was disqualified
from the competition.
Now, rumors have been flying,
but there's one thing
for certain.
There's never been
a more controversial queen.
Let's take a look.
Willam,
it has come to my attention
that you have broken the rules.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
[cheers and applause]
Ladies and gentlemen,
to set the record straight
about Willam...
you'll have to tune in
to this season's premiere
of<i> RuPaul's Drag U,</i>
coming this summer on Logo.
[audience groans]
Just kidding.
J.K., Miss Thing.
[laughter]
Please welcome back Willam.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Willam, I want the answer
to the question
everyone is dying to know.
Audience, let's say it together.
all: What did Willam do?
What did Willam do?
What did Willam do?
- What didn't I do?
[laughter]
- No, seriously,
I want you to take a deep breath
and break it down for me, okay?
- When you go away to<i> Drag Race,</i>
you can't tell anybody.
It's top secret.
And I told my husband
I was doing
a non-union horror movie
in Europe,
which I've done before,
and they suck,
so don't watch them.
And he didn't believe me.
He's like, "Why you gotta
take all this drag?"
So I lied, and he followed me
to the hotel.
And then the first night
he knocked on my door,
and it was a delivery.
- So in other words,
you were receiving
conjugal visits
from your husband,
and unfortunately
that was a violation
of the rules.
- Visiting makes it sound like
we were visiting.
There wasn't no talking.
- [laughs]
- But they were
very long visits.
He's 6'6".
- Oh, yes, yes.
Listen, I was disappointed
to see you go
and so were your fans.
[cheering]
- Thank you.
- I want you to know that
I really, really believe in you.
And actually I thought you had
a chance to go all the way.
[cheers and applause]
Do you have any regrets?
- Um...
I was gonna be flippant,
but after hearing you say that,
um...I regret that...
I maybe--
I should win next time.
- [laughs]
- Well, Willam, I have one
last question to ask.
- Sure.
- And this is
a serious question.
- All right.
- Do you have anything to plug?
- I have my new single,
the<i> WDWD Doot-Doot Trouble</i><span style="bodyStyle"> mix</i>
on iTunes.
And here's a little sticker.
- Oh, great, thank you.
- Yeah, and they're scented too.
They smell like a sticker.
- Oh, yeah, they do.
Yeah, yeah.
Willam, I expect great things
from you in the future,
so keep breaking the rules,
mama.
Just don't break my rules, okay?
- No, your show, your rules.
- That's right.
This next queen won our hearts
and made us cry
and redefined
the meaning of the word "bitch,"
being in total control
of herself.
I'm talking about
Latrice motherfucking Royale.
Let's take a look.
[cheers and applause]
- You have changed my life
forever.
You have changed the world
of drag forever.
Thank you for seeing
something special in me.
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- [laughs]
Now, I wanna ask you, Latrice,
how has<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
changed your life?
- I am not the same.
I mean, the overwhelming
response that I'm getting,
the outpour of love
that I'm getting,
I never expected
to get all this.
I mean, really.
But I truly am humbled by it.
I thank you so much.
I definitely feel that, um,
I'm inspired
to keep on keeping on
because doing me works.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, you were very open
about your prison background.
Do you regret letting the world
know about that?
- No, that was the most
liberating thing
that I ever coulda done.
I want people to realize that
it's okay to make mistakes.
It's okay to fall down.
Get up, look sickening,
and make them eat it.
[cheers and applause]
- I hear that you brought
a letter from a fan.
- I did.
I did it just so--
if it's not all wet.
- Oh.
- Moist.
- Ew, dear.
- Delicious.
- Oh, okay.
- Says, "Hi, Latrice.
"I just wanted to tell you
what a role model you have been
"for my ten-year-old daughter
Katherine.
"We get in bed
every Monday night together
"and watch the Drag Race.
"She's been dealing with
some bullying issues,
"but lately she's been
channeling her inner Latrice
and showing those bitches
the door."
[cheers and applause]
"When I drop her off at school
in the morning,
"I tell her,
'You be fierce, mama.'
"Much love.
Rock on.
Gina from Florida."
- That is lovely.
I love it.
Well, of course you haven't
seen the last of Latrice.
I'm very excited to announce
that she's joining the faculty
of<i> Drag U</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this summer</i>
right here on Logo TV
and logotv.com.
Give it up for
Latrice motherfucking Royale.
[cheers and applause]
The shade, the shade of it all.
The shade, the shade, the shade.
Ha, it's fabulous.
Gorgeous.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Last week, our top three queens
were lip syncing for their lives
to my single<i> Glamazon,</i>
available on iTunes and Amazon.
[cheers and applause]
Tonight they're dying
to find out
who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Please welcome back to the stage
the top three.
[cheers and applause]
My girls, my girls.
Can you feel the love tonight?
- Oh, it's incredible.
- Fabulous.
- It's "phierce" with a "p-h".
- Yes.
- Sharon, Phi Phi,
for most of the season
the two of you hated each other.
Why?
- Well, who first?
- It's really hard
for me to hate someone,
and it's really easy for me
just to get along with anyone
when I can just find
a redeeming quality.
Unfortunately,
it was really hard for me
to find a redeeming quality.
I mean, that's--
[cheers and applause]
- And Phi Phi, uh, why did you
hate Sharon so much?
- I did feel that a lot of times
instead of talking to me
as a person,
she was talking down to me
or at me,
and I don't take that very well.
But, I mean, I love her and
I respect what she does and--
- Bullshit.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, Chad,
you defended Phi Phi
for most of the season.
- I did.
- How do you feel about her now?
- As I watched the season
from home,
I realized that there were times
when I wasn't around that
Phi Phi really
let her ass hang out,
and, um, a lot happened
when I wasn't there.
And I literally felt like I was
walking around in a cloud.
Specifically setting up
Jiggly to fail.
Um, well, trying to set up
Willam to go home
by having Latrice
throw the contest.
And then the thing that just
left me really unsettled,
Phi Phi, in the Gold Bar,
when you came for Willam
it wasn't an attack
on his talent,
and it wasn't an attack on
what he was doing at the show.
It was a personal attack.
And I just--
I just felt as though
you could have behaved
a little bit better.
But that's my opinion, baby.
- And I complete--
I completely understand
where you're coming from,
and I do--
I watch the show now
and I see that--
watching, I'm like,
oh, I'm insane.
[laughter]
And, um, I just felt sometimes
that you guys were attacking me,
and so maybe that was
my defense mechanism.
- I wanna hear from
some of the other queens.
Do you have anything to say
to any of our top three queens?
Jiggly?
- This hurts a lot.
Phi Phi, me and you,
we supposed to be road dogs.
We supposed to be sisters.
You came to my crib.
You chilled with me.
And for me to see that
like that at--
damn, girl, I swear to god.
Ooh, I just felt betrayed.
And you always were like,
"You can lean on me
and you can lean on me,"
and then that.
I felt like a sucker.
And I'm supposed to be
your sister?
That shit ain't cool with me.
- You know,
I completely apologize
if that hurt you in any way,
but when I signed on
to this show--
and people might not
agree to it--
I signed in to win $100,000
and a crown.
- Honestly, like, I think--
I'm an egomaniac.
Everybody knows that.
But, like, she should be studied
down there.
I don't understand it.
It's almost sociopathic the way
she'll tell people, um,
"It was just a character.
I was just playing it up."
And then she'll sign autographs,
"Fuck Willam, fuck Sharon."
It's not cool.
And I understand
that it's a game.
I never retaliated on the show
because I didn't care
and indifference
is worse than hate.
And I'm not gonna "RuPaulogize"
for anything that I'm doing now.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, bitch.
Oh, bitch.
Consider that word stolen,
honey.
[cheers and applause]
My new album will be called
"RuPaulogize" on iTunes.
[cheers and applause]
All right, ladies,
it's time to find out
which one of you bitches
will be named Miss Congeniality.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
The fans have spoken.
And this year's
Miss Congeniality is...

Latrice Royale.

Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
My girls, Chad Michaels,
Sharon Needles,
and Phi Phi O'Hara,
in a moment
one of you will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
First up, Chad Michaels.
Now, you've impressed everyone
with your grace
and professionalism.
Chad, I want to know
how you're feeling right now.
- This has meant a lot to me,
and just to be here with this
incredible group of friends
and with you, Ru,
I'm galvanized, I'm focused,
and I'm ready to
take home the crown tonight.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, do you have
someone special
here tonight rooting for you?
- You know I do.
I have my partner, Adam Magee.
He's right over here.
- Hi.
[cheers and applause]
- So, Adam.
- Yes?
- Now, you design out--
did you design this outfit?
- From head to toe, sweetheart.
- Really?
[cheers and applause]
Gorgeous.
I'll have one in every color.
[laughter]
Now, Chad, I want to ask you:
What would it mean for you
to become America's
next drag superstar?
- It would be a personal test
that I put on myself
that I passed.
It would be showing me
what I'm made of.
It would be justifying
all the support that I have had
over the last 20 years of--
basically I get to
play dress up for a living
and walk around the stage
and move my lips.
I think lastly, Ru, for me
and for so many entertainers
across the country
it would be my honor
and my privilege
to represent<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
and to work for you, mama.
[cheers and applause]
- Chad Michaels,
I want to thank you
for elevating this
beautiful race to the highest.
You are a class act.
- Thank you, Ru.
Thank you, thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, up next,
Sharon Needles.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Sharon, you've become
quite the cult figure.
How does it feel?
- It's humbling
because, you know,
I came here, you know, to show,
you know, the underbelly
and the underground outsider
art side of drag
and try and get $100,000
doing it,
and now it's become
a full-time job
and a responsibility
to so many young people.
I get hundreds of letters
a week.
I never thought I would
touch people like that.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, you have
some special people
here tonight to cheer you on.
- I do.
I have my girlfriend
with a penis, Alaska.
[cheers and applause]
And I also have my
mommy dearest, Joan craw--
or excuse me,
Joan Coady right there.
[cheers and applause]
- Was he a spooky child?
- Well, he's always been a fan
of horror movies
and Halloween in general.
In our house, Halloween costumes
didn't come out of a box.
And the last unspooky costume
I remember was the scarecrow
from<i> The Wizard of Oz.</i>
So from then on it's just been
zombies and bloody things.
- [laughs]
What would it mean for you
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- Well, first it would be
such a great honor.
Being the holder of the crown
would show that you don't
have to fit a certain mold
to make it in any industry
or in any desire that you want.
And for any gay kid out there
or just weird kid
that gets picked on,
just know, you know,
when in doubt, freak them out.
Do whatever the fuck
you wanna do, and--
[cheers and applause]
And if anyone
ever boos you offstage,
that is simply
applause from ghosts.
You remember that.
- [laughs]
[audience boos]
- I love it.
[cheers and applause]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
[cheers and applause]
No one has been in it to win it
more than you have,
and that drive has propelled you
into the top three.
Now, what's the best thing
to come out of the experience?
- As many haters as I have,
I would definitely have to say
that the fans,
the fans that I do have,
because, granted I came in here
to win the $100,000,
a crown, title of
America's next drag superstar,
but I wanted to be the backbone
and strength
for a lot of those kids
that had to go through,
like, a child abuse past
and stuff like that
and just have that person
that they could look up to
that I didn't have as a child.
- Right,
now you've been very honest
about your relationship
with your father.
And have things improved
since the show aired?
- No.
- Does he know
you've done the show?
- Yeah.
Um...
I know he watches it, and, um,
and I know he doesn't like it.
But I love me.
And, um--
[cheers and applause]
If I can show any kids out there
to be strong
and, um, live life for yourself
and just be happy,
make sure that at the end of the
day when you go to bed,
as long as you love yourself
and you're proud
of everything that you did,
fuck what everybody else says.
[cheers and applause]
- So, Phi Phi, who's here
rooting for you tonight?
- The person
I look up to the most,
um, my beautiful mother.
[applause]
- And what's your mom's name?
- That's Rhonda.
- Hi, Rhonda.
What do you think of Phi Phi?
- I think he's beautiful.
I just think that the judges
made a call right
when they said he may of wore
a little bit too much makeup.
[laughter]
- Shut up.
- But he toned it down,
and he looks great.
He looks just like me.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Phi Phi,
what would it mean to you
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
- Money in the bank.
[laughter]
And, um, like I said, a voice.
I just want to show people that
you can fight for anything that
you want,
and never let anybody stop you
because if you want it,
you can make it happen.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
And I just want to say,
watching you
in this competition grow
and be such a fighter has just
really been amazing.
And no matter what anybody says,
you are fantastic,
and you deserve
to be in this race, okay?
Let's give
a big round of applause
for our top three.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>

You are the winner
of this challenge.
Latrice Royale,
shantay, you stay.
Dida Ritz, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Once again,
I've been criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle, I want you
to confer with Santino
to decide which one
of the eliminated queens...
deserves to return.
- No, bitch, top four.
No mo' hos.
-<i> And tonight...</i>

Cluck-cluck, top four.

- "Stay true.
Chad, Needles, Latrice."
- Dida's gone, but she left
a little piece of herself
for us to remember her.
- all: Cheesecake!
- I'm gonna miss Dida.
She was fierce!
- She was fierce.
- [indistinct]
- Love her.
- I had so much fun
getting to know her.
- We--yeah,
me and Dida connected.
<i>It's a bittersweet situation.</i>
<i>Yeah, one more bitch</i>
<i>is out the door,</i>
but Dida was my girl.
- Were you nervous?
- You know, I thought
I was gonna be really nervous,
but after, like,
the first beat kicked in,
bitch, I was craving
for some show action.
- You were good.
You put Dida straight to bed.
You took us to church, she
took us to a Beyoncé concert.
- Which is fine, but not
for Gladys Knight.
- Sometimes girls
give too much energy
for a song that just needs
some delicate, soulful moves.
- That's it.
- You gave it.
- So congratulations, Needles.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, your third win.
- Oh, stop!
- Okay, so let's say this right
now so it's really official.
We are...
- all: The top four.
- So some shit's gonna go down.
- No.
-<i> There will be a departed queen</i>
returning to the competition
this morning.
Who do you think it's gonna be?
- Bringing anyone back
isn't fair in my opinion.
- We should make up some
shirts or some shit.
- Shirts, or, like, signs.
- Signs.
- Yes.
- Top four. Add no more.
- Let's do this, honey.
Let's get it all going.
This sucks,
and we're protesting.
Top four. Add no more.
[siren wails]
- Oh, let's go.
<i>- Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>You got she-mail.</i>
<i>Ladies, this competition</i>
<i>is still pregnant</i>
<i>with possibilities.</i>
<i>And soon a star will be born.</i>
<i>But will it be a labor of love</i>
<i>or a bastard of disaster?</i>
<i>Time to push, ladies.</i>
<i>Push!</i>
<i>'Cause I'm about to crown...</i>
<i>[moans]</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
<i>I hope it's a queen.</i>
<i>[giggles]</i>
Hello, hello, hello.
- all: [chanting]
Top four. Add no more.
Top four. Add no more.
Top four. Add no more.
- Whoo!
- Nice try, Norma Rae.
But this week we are celebrating
the modern drag family,
starting with the return
of one of your soul sisters.
Ladies, please welcome back...
Oh, the suspense is killing me.
[cheers]
-<i> Kenya Michaels is back.</i>
- She's a force
to be reckoned with.
She can dance, and she's pretty.
And that's exactly
what we don't need right now.
- Welcome home, mama.
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I'm back in the building.
<i>I'm ready to compete.</i>
So let's prepare, ladies.
- Oh, pit crew.
For today's mini challenge,
you need to get crafty
and turn these papa bears
into mama bears.
You'll have 20 minutes
to drag out your teddy bear.
The one queen with the most
unbearably beautiful critter
will win.
Ready, set, growl.
Whoo-hoo.
- Better make
your spook bear, bitch.
Spoo...kity.
- Sorry, Kenya, we've lost
our fucking minds.
- Look what you left me with.
Now I'm not the youngest or
the shortest or the fishiest.
- And you never will be,
Blanche.
And you never were.
[laughs]
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
Let's take a look
at your lady bears.
- RuPaul, meet Malibu Bearbie.
- She's very Jiggly Caliente.
- Yes.
[laughter]
- May I call you Jiggly?
Next up, Sharon Needles.
The bride of Chucky wore black.
- She's part
of the Scare Bear collection.
I let her borrow my contacts.
- So who do we have here?
- We have La Transbear.
- Are those pasties
she has there?
- Yeah, her pasties are sexy.
- She is a fishy bear,
and bears love fish.
- This is Portia the Pooh.
- I see that her face
is bejeweled.
- Like mother, like daughter.
- This is Princess Bitch Bear.
She comes complete
with a set of accessories.
- Booger Bear.
- Those are all
jealous bears over there.
- Ladies, one bear
is creating a panda-monium.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
- Yay.
-<i> Yes, I win.</i>
La Transbear.
- But, ladies, you can all
be proud of your work,
because all
of your dragged-out bears
will be auctioned off
by the Bear to Make
a Difference Project...
- all: Aww.
- Which supports
the Matthew Shepard Foundation's
effort to erase hate.
Can I get a amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- ["elderly" voice] Ladies,
when I was growing up,
a man went to work...
[normal] And left his wife
at home to raise the children.
But in today's modern families,
we expect a lot more
from our father figures.
Now, to prove my point,
I want you to meet some DILFs.
Or dads I'd like to frock.
[laughter]
- Whoa.
<i>Truck-driving, burly men, like,</i>
for real, for real.
[chuckles]
- Ladies, for today's
main challenge,
you need to transform
these handsome daddies
into sexy drag queen mamas.
All right, dads,
please introduce yourselves.
- I'm Leland,
the father of six.
- Six?
- Yes.
- Damn, Leland.
- Hi, I'm Rick, and I have
a beautiful daughter.
She's six years old.
And a beautiful son.
He's four years old.
- My name's James.
I have a beautiful
two-year-old daughter.
- My name's Chris.
I'm a proud father
of two beautiful girls.
- My name is Mike.
I have six children
and five grandchildren.
- Wow, so you're a grandfather
I'd like to frock.
- I am.
- All right, Lil' Kenya.
Since you won the mini
challenge,
you get to pick a daddy
for each of the other girls.
- You go with Chad Michaels.
- I'm looking at Kenya,
and I'm kind of doing,
like, the eye thing,
so that way she knows,
like, to send the guy
this way or this way.
- You're gonna go...
- When she comes
to pick out my guy,
I just give her,
like, a little nod,
so that way she just comes
and gives me my guy.
- With Phi Phi.
Um...
You're gonna be spooky.
- Okay.
- Hi.
Sharon Needles.
- The guy that I have been given
has the brickest face
in the bunch.
He's too manly to be pretty.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Leland is with Latrice.
So, Lil' Kenya,
who's your daddy?
- This is my daddy.
- [giggles]
- My guy is the most
beautiful woman.
Because he's gonna look
like Jessica Wild something.
- Now you can use your own drag,
plus extra materials and hair,
courtesy of Risque Wigs.
Now I'm expecting to see
a strong family resemblance.
And tomorrow, on the main stage,
to keep things in a family way,
you and your daddy mama
will be carrying
a bun in the oven.
- [laughs]
- That's right.
The category is...
baby bump realness.
-<i> It's one thing</i>
<i>to put these dads in drag.</i>
<i>But now it got to be</i>
<i>maternity clothes?</i>
<i>You gonna be pregnant?</i>
Ugh.
- Okay, little mamas,
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
got you into this situation.
Now you need to use it
to turn it out.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best mother win.
- All right, come on.
- How do you call--
what do you call 'em?
- These are sequins.
- Sequins.
- I didn't even know
they made stuff like this.
- Is that your cell phone in
your pants
or are you just happy to see me?
- Nope.
- Okay.
Didn't told me I was
in the movie<i> Anaconda.</i>
What's going on here?
- Oh, my God.
This one's a freak.
Mike-o the Psycho is so weird.
- Ooh, baby.
- [chuckles]
- He makes me want to run
and take a shower immediately.
- You single?
- Not today.
- Sharon's DILF
looks freakin' insane.
He's like<i> the</i>
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i><span style="bodyStyle"> killer.</i>
- So we got to get you pregnant.
- Why do we have to be pregnant?
Today we have to turn DILFs
into MILFs--
<i>pregnant, glamorous MILFs.</i>
- Man.
Ugh.
- You have to get rid
of your manhood.
- But that will hurt.
- No, it doesn't hurt.
- If you push 'em
up inside you--
- Nah, it's--
that's where they go.
- Ooh!
- It's either that or you can
sit on 'em, and that's not--
- Sit on--oh, shit, no!
- Exactly, so...
- You can't--you tape it to your
leg or something like that?
[laughing]
- You gonna be serving
moose knuckles.
- So they want to see,
like, the transformation,
like, the difference.
And you'd look like a dude.
- Pretty manly man.
- I get paired up with Chris,
and I'm super excited,
because he's really
getting into this.
- I'm down to go all the way.
- Awesome.
- I want to win this shit.
- It's kind of fun
teaching a straight guy
how to be me.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, you?
- Good.
- Don't talk to my dad.
- I can talk to your dad
if I want.
- All right?
Maybe your dad likes me better.
- He wants to be on the winning
team, so I doubt it.
- Yeah.
'Cause we're gonna win.
- You like that?
He even talks like Phi Phi.
- I was like,
"You're just like me."
That's what I like, 'cause
that way I can school these hos.
- Phi Phi loves to come for me,
and she can come for me
all she wants.
Come for me, baby.
<i>However,</i>
<i>I have to stay focused.</i>
What I'm producing
has to be perfect.
- No, that's way too bright.
I don't like the fact
that it's so long.
- 'Cause I'm thinking,
like, right about here.
Show some hip.
- He could chill out
just a little bit,
'cause I do know
what I'm doing,
and I don't need
too much direction.
- I want, like, a four-inch...
Bam!
- Walk.
Come on, walk.
Okay.
Okay, don't bounce.
Don't do that.
No, don't do that.
Okay, come on.
Walk, walk.
How you feel?
- Like, it--
it just--
Is that how they usually feel?
Like, hurting here?
- Yeah.
All the time.
- All the time?
- Yeah, all the time.
- My toes are
like this right now.
[laughs]
Yeah, I know,
because you have a men feet.
[laughing]
- Ah, fuck,
these shoes fucking hurt.
- Walk in the fucking heels
and then shut up!
- I might as well
level with you.
- Yeah.
- All these girls here
are like classic beauty queens.
I like to look kind of, like,
half dead most of the time.
- Who am I to judge anybody?
- Do you have both your shoes?
- The way I look at it,
go big or stay home.
- Right.
- Right?
- Agreed.
<i>- Sharon Needles' DILF</i>
<i>is really, really</i>
<i>rough in the face.</i>
- Well, what do you
do for a living?
What makes you so strong?
- I was a sheriff's deputy.
- Oh! I see.
Law enforcement?
- So don't step out of line
or I'm gonna throw
the handcuffs on you.
- Oh, got it, got it.
Challenges either
go two ways with me:
I either feel
ridiculously confident...
- No, no.
Don't be so out.
- Yeah, you don't want
to walk like that.
-<i> Or I know I'm up the shit</i>
<i>crick without a paddle.</i>
Feel your ass
going back and forth.
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>Sharon, mama,</i>
you may be in trouble.
- Foot in front of foot,
crossing over.
- Sharon, he walks
just like you already, girl.
[laughing]
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hey, Ru.
- Oh, Ru!
- Well, hello, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Ru.
- And Chris.
Apparently you're
making your outfits?
- We want to be,
like, sexy moms.
We're gonna have, like, fun,
flirty little pregnant dresses.
- You've been criticized
for proportions.
- I'll be fine.
It'll work.
I get worried when you do that,
"Oh, it's gonna be fine."
- I know you do.
- "It'll work. It'll work.
It'll be fine."
Remember, there have been times
when you've done that
and it didn't work.
Now, do you think
you have enough time
to finish sewing these outfits?
- Yeah.
It's not gonna take long.
There's that thing again.
"It'll be fine."
- Stop it!
No, we're gonna be good.
- Get to sewing.
- All righty.
Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Hi, Leland.
Hi, Latrice.
- Hello, Ru.
- Will you be wearing
matching gowns?
- Um, well...
- We're looking
for a family resemblance.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- But it's gonna
work out, I think.
- So, Leland,
what are you most nervous about?
- Walking in them shoes.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
- You play sports at all?
- I used to.
- Yeah, well, because, honestly,
it has to do with
your center of gravity
and knowing your body
and your hand-eye coordination.
- Still ain't got no
coordination for basketball
with dribbling and--no, no.
- Right. Hmm.
All right, Royale sisters,
you have a lot of work to do.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Hey, Rick.
- Hi.
- Hey, Lil' Kenya.
You look like Elvis.
Do people tell you that?
- My mom told me I look
like a young Elvis, yeah.
- Now you're gonna look
like Lisa Marie Presley.
Have you picked
a drag name for Rick?
- She gonna be my Lil' Mama.
- Lil' Mama.
- Because I'm Lil' Kenya.
[laughs]
- How do you feel
about that, Lil' Mama?
- Uh...I don't feel
like a little mama.
- Well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.
Let them have it.
- Bye.
- Hey, Chad.
- Hey, RuPaul.
- Wow, look at this.
- Isn't that fun?
- Yeah, it was both our idea.
We're both very technical people
when we start out--
"Is it off? It is doing this?
Doing that?"
- He's taking a very
active role in this,
and he's very assertive.
- Now you've been doing this
for a long time.
Can you look at James' face
and tell what he's
gonna look like
just based on bone structure?
- Yeah, he's gonna be pretty.
- Really?
- We'll see.
- I'm gonna let you get
back to it, okay?
- Thank you.
- Mike and Sharon Needles.
- Hello.
- How are you two kids
getting along?
Mike, you're getting into it
early, aren't you?
- Oh.
<i>I'm embarrassed by Mike</i>
because he seems
to have no filter.
- Why'd you decide to do this?
- 'Cause I want to bring out
my inner diva.
The only problem I have
with this outfit
is I think I'm having a baby
elephant.
You want to see his trunk?
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
Good luck taming Mike.
- Thank you so much, Ru.
- Gather round.
Ladies and gentlemen,
tomorrow night we'll be joined
by our extra-special
guest judges,
one of TV's favorite dads...
<i>Modern Family's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Jesse Tyler Ferguson.
- Yeah!
- He's cute as a button.
- And the always lovely
Miss Jennifer Love Hewitt.
[gasps and exclamations]
But before you have a baby...
there needs to be
a little seduction.
So tomorrow, prior to your baby
bump runway presentation,
each couple needs
to get us in the mood
with a sexy striptease.
- What?
- Insane.
- And, in the words
of my sainted mother...
God damn it, you pussy-mouthed
motherfuckers...
Don't fuck it up.
- Welcome to the runway.
- Awesome.
- It's time for me and James
to do our striptease,
and I'm a little apprehensive.
- We just have to figure out
how to make it sexy,
'cause it's supposed to be
like a striptease.
That's not turning me on yet,
dude.
-<i> I figured, with James,</i>
<i>since he doesn't have</i>
<i>a lot of experience,</i>
<i>you keep it simple.</i>
Walk out, looking at each other.
Then let's hit.
So your arm's gonna go up on--
your right arm.
And you know how I like
to be perfect, darling.
Boom, and then throw it.
You've never stripped before,
I'm sure.
- No.
- You've been
to a strip joint, though.
- Yeah.
- Lap dance?
- Oh, yeah.
- Tipping?
- Yeah.
- Poles?
- Yeah.
- All of it. All right.
Hold right, and then boom.
Perfect.
Real sexy, hands on hips.
Right to the X right here.
Pose. Perfect.
Just work your sexiness.
Like this. Look.
Ah.
- Okay.
- Perfect.
Just up. Perfect.
Give me five, brother.
- Got it.
- That's my man.
- You're gonna win.
- I hope so.
- So cross out.
- Wait, wait,
I didn't even cross.
I think I feel like
I'm walking off the stage.
- One, two, three, four.
Five, six...
- Oh, fuck.
That's all right, I got to
get used to the spin.
- It's kind of difficult
to transform, like,
a big, old, macho straight guy
into, like,
a real feminine woman.
Five, six, grab it.
Seven, eight.
- Five, six.
Oh, no, wait.
-<i> No, that's clearly a dude.</i>
- I feel like I'm
doing the Hulkamania.
Rrr!
[chuckles]
- Do you know what fishy means?
Like a girl.
Like, "ay!"
- Yeah!
- Kiss. Boom.
- Boom.
- No, you said boom after me.
That means you're
not timing with me.
- Uh...
back?
I know I should have saved my
brain cells when I was a kid.
- That's no excuse.
Turning. Now what?
- I'm fucking brain-dead, dude.
- I want to kill him,
<i>because I have created</i>
<i>the most simplest,</i>
<i>cheapest routine</i>
that Helen Keller could do
on the first try.
Can you skip?
- Nope.
- I'm panicking.
- I suck. It is what it is.
- Don't say, "it is what it is,"
'cause it's my 100,000
fucking dollars.
I need to make sure
that he's giving 100%.
<i>But I don't think</i>
<i>I'm going to get it.</i>
- You okay?
- It's coming alive now.
There she go.
You know who you look like
right now?
Rick James.
[laughter]
- You're trying to make me look
like Teena Marie, though.
[laughter]
- Hold on.
I dropped my bush.
-<i> Sharon's DILF</i>
<i>is a cross-dressing,</i>
support-group-needing dad.
- Mm.
[inhales]
- No, no, no, no.
We don't fetishize the clothes.
- He's a little bit
too comfortable,
if you know what I mean.
- What if one of your daughters
grew up to be gay?
What would you tell them?
- I wouldn't care.
- You wouldn't care at all?
- No.
Even if I had a son.
- That's good.
- It is what it is.
- But that's good
that you wouldn't
shun your kids or anything.
My dad, he didn't
like it at all.
- That sucks.
- I haven't talked to him
since I was, like, 18.
- One day he'll realize
what he's not being part of.
-<i> It's really cool to talk</i>
<i>to someone that, you know,</i>
they're straight but they see
how my lifestyle is
and it's okay to be who I am.
If you had a son,
would you have him audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- No, 'cause he'll probably do
a better job than I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- I do. Yeah.
- How long?
- Eight years, and I was here
during our anniversary.
- On our eighth-year
anniversary,
we renewed our vows.
- Well, we might renew our vows
if we can ever get married.
- Why call it a marriage
if you're gonna
offend so many people?
- It's making everybody equal.
Say I've been together
with somebody for 40 years.
Say I get sick.
I go into the hospital.
They can't come visit me,
because they're not
related to me in any way.
So that's what
we're fighting for.
- That's what you're
standing up and saying.
- That would kill me to know,
if I was sick,
laying in a bed somewhere,
that Adam couldn't come see me.
No, it's cool.
I just, you know.
It just comes up, you know.
It's like--just to know that,
God, he would be locked out
and that he would be
left with nothing.
- I don't believe
that's fair at all.
I support you guys.
Everybody should have the right
to love who they want
to love, you know?
- You expect me to walk up
on this thing in these?
- Yeah.
Put on them shoes, boo-boo.
- [groans]
I can't even
walk on it barefoot.
Ooh. [laughs]
[exhales]
Okay.
- Tell me you got some rhythm.
- I got some rhythm, but I don't
know if I got any sexiness.
Oh!
<i>- I need sexy swagger.</i>
<i>I need hips and ass,</i>
and he don't have
none of that going.
- Whoa.
- You're okay with your shoes?
- Yeah.
Do I need 'em right now?
- You have to practice.
Come on.
One and two, the chair.
The legs.
Ha, ha, ha.
I do the split.
He need to be sexy.
Come on.
One more time.
Five, six, seven.
[speaks indistinctly]
<i>Rick is a hot guy,</i>
<i>but he's not a dancer.</i>
- That's it?
- Oh, my god.
- Pfft!
- One, two, three, four.
It's the end of the day,
<i>and I'm panicking,</i>
<i>because we have</i>
<i>a short window of time</i>
to get something so simple done.
Since you're strong,
what if I turned around
and you caught me?
- Yeah, let's make it
more difficult.
- Yeah.
- Ladies, can you vacate
our runway, please?
- "Vacate our runway."
- Get the fuck off our runway.
- We're better off than them.
- Don't make up excuses why
you guys are inferior to us.
- Well, their dance techniques
are bitchin'.
- Not really.
- A little bit
too much testosterone
running around here, sunshine.
- Why are you getting
such a bad attitude right now?
- Because I got
my diva bitch attitude,
and we're gonna win it,
and you guys
need to just stay home.
- Oh, I get it,
it's your diva bitch attitude.
- Yeah, just stay home.
- Bitch, I didn't come here
to stay home, "ossifer".
What?
What are you gonna do to me?
Beat my skinny ass up?
Go for it.
I don't give a shit.
I'll fucking put you
in jail too.
- Know what's funny, is nobody
laughs at your shit but you.
Can't take it, huh?
<i>- Mike's in our space.</i>
<i>It's not the locker room.</i>
I don't need all that,
like, macho bullsh--crap.
<i>It's completely out of line</i>
<i>and I'm not having it.</i>
- I hope it isn't your last day
here tomorrow.
- But you know what,
you're not gonna fucking come up
in my motherfucking workroom
and talk to me like this,<i> sir.</i>
- I just did, didn't I?
- Well, you know what, maybe you
need to be fucking removed
with your badass
motherfucking attitude.
Fuck that shit.
Sharon.
- You're gonna let this
bitch talk to me like this?
- Oh, I'm a bitch now?
- Do not call my sister a bitch.
<i>I'm working with a DILK--</i>
a dad I'd like to kill.
- Cluck-cluck, ladies.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Y'all are gonna be women.
<i>- We're back</i>
<i>in the workroom today,</i>
<i>and I have to get myself</i>
<i>in drag, my dad in drag,</i>
and we have to get
ready for the runway.
- I stirred
the shit up yesterday.
I wanted to give 'em
something to think about.
A little drag queen drama.
- Inescapable.
- So let me ask you a question.
Were you ever bullied in school?
- Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?
It was terrible.
You know, they'd wait for me
after school
and, like, beat me up.
- I mean, is this anything
you could report to the police?
- I never wanted to report it,
'cause I was embarrassed.
- Man, I'm sorry.
That's got to be
so frickin' hard, man.
You know, I'm learning
a lot about the world.
-<i> As much as I rag on Mike,</i>
<i>he certainly was sympathetic</i>
<i>to the fact that I went through</i>
<i>a lot of hell growing up.</i>
Still doesn't know
how to fucking dance.
- Dude, it's already squashed.
- Yeah, yeah.
I need to put tape.
Let me finish.
- No, I'm not taping my dick.
- Just tuck it back.
It don't feel that bad.
It's okay.
<i>- I remember a friend</i>
<i>in high school tucking</i>
<i>after he saw</i>
Silence of the Lambs.
Ugh!
- Let me see.
<i>Rick can't tuck himself.</i>
I have to...
- What about the balls?
- You can take your dick
from the back and pull up.
- Like that?
- No. More.
- It's gonna look like a tail.
- [laughs]
- Put it on the side
of the balls?
- It's from back.
- I think the balls are too big.
- [laughs]
I'm sorry.
- I'm really glad I didn't have
to kick your ass yesterday.
- It was all in a good time,
you know.
I just--I may have pushed the
envelope a little too far,
but I was totally joking.
- It's all right.
I needed to blow
some steam off anyway.
- Well, it's good.
You can use me for that.
I have a really good poker face.
I was cracking up inside.
- I'm sure you were.
- Ain't no fun
if there ain't no drama.
That's the way I look at it.
- [giggles maniacally]
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage. Hi, mami.
- How are you, baby?
We match tonight.
- And we're all eating
at red lobster.
- Mm-mm.
- Santino Rice.
- Great to be here, Ru.
- And look who
the stork brought.
It's Jesse Tyler Ferguson.
- Hi, Ru.
- Are you ready
to meet my modern family?
- Bring 'em on. All of 'em.
- [laughs]
Jennifer Love Hewitt,
welcome to our blessed event.
- Thank you for having me. Hi.
- Will you be
our drag whisperer?
- Yes.
[laughter]
- This week,
the queens were challenged
to transform real-life daddies
into sexy drag mamas.
They'll perform
a seductive striptease
before they rock-a-bye
the runway
wearing their best
baby bump eleganza.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah!
-<i> We're doing the choreography.</i>
Rick know the choreography,
but Rick's not sexy.
-<i> It's like dancing with</i>
<i>Leslie Nielsen in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Airplane!</i>
<i>That's what I thought</i>
<i>he looked like.</i>
- [laughs]
-<i> Leland's missing</i>
<i>a couple of cues,</i>
<i>but I'm not worried about it.</i>
<i>We're working it out</i>
<i>the best way we can.</i>
- Oh, yeah.
-<i> It's top five,</i>
<i>so the judges</i>
<i>are gonna look for anything</i>
<i>to put us in the bottom,</i>
<i>so I hope that our routine</i>
<i>was good enough to get us by.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Let the baby
bump parade begin.
- Sharelle and Latrice Royale.
- The water has broken, honey.
- Oh, Lord.
- You better get
Lamaze over here.
- Nine months later.
-<i> If you're part</i>
<i>of the Royale family,</i>
<i>you're definitely</i>
<i>gonna be a glamour girl.</i>
<i>So Leland's looking</i>
<i>very elegant, very lady.</i>
<i>He's looking gorgeous.</i>
- She didn't know
she was pregnant.
Gi Gi and Phi Phi O'Hara.
Ladies, the auditions
for<i> 16 and Pregnant</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
are down the hall.
[laughter]
-<i> Chris and I are basically</i>
<i>just trying to serve</i>
<i>sexy, pregnant MILF realness.</i>
<i>I kind of feel like he was</i>
<i>a drag queen in a past life,</i>
<i>because he's</i>
<i>doing this too good.</i>
- It's a boy.
It's a girl.
It's both.
[laughter]
- Best friends and pregnant.
[laughter]
- Lil' Mama
and Lil' Kenya Michaels.
- Being pregnant's hard.
- Macabre too apparently.
- Yeah.
- We're in this together, mom.
-<i> I know that Rick</i>
<i>gonna be a man,</i>
<i>and I think, okay,</i>
<i>if Rick gonna be a man,</i>
<i>gonna be a beautiful man.</i>
- Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian.
- It is.
- Next up, Robin Mansions
and Sharon Needles.
Honey, they're having
Rosemary's Baby.
- My other eye
is my good judgment eye.
-<i> Me and Robin are serving up</i>
<i>filthy-ass bad girls.</i>
<i>Who slept with Robin?</i>
<i>Who got her pregnant?</i>
- Is this morning sickness
or is she gagging on her beauty?
- Apparently, Marilyn Manson
does have a uterus.
- Lady Samantha
and Chad Michaels.
Now, that is an immaculate
misconception.
- Paris Hilton,
meet your future.
-<i> We are serving Carnaval</i>
<i>pregnancy realness.</i>
<i>We're so happy to be pregnant,</i>
<i>and we're glowing</i>
<i>with anticipation.</i>
- There's a couple
of baby boomers.
- It's a very long child.
- It is a tall one.
My cervix is softening
just watching.
- Is it?
Mwah.
Welcome, ladies.
First up, Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.
- How are you?
- Hi, judges.
- Let's take a look at Lady
Samantha's before pictures.
That's James.
And, baby, look at you now.
Did you tuck?
- A little bit, yes.
- Oh.
- How do you tuck
just a little bit?
- Yeah, just push things around.
- Like, just between
your cheek and gums?
- Yes, sir.
[laughter]
- Yes, ma'am. It's yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I have to say, James,
Lady Samantha if you're nasty,
I think you're wearing
the highest heels
on the catwalk here,
which I think
should not go unrecognized.
Very impressive.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- James, I love that you
were almost, like,
put out with how hot you were.
[laughs]
I thought that was really great.
I'd like to adopt that quality.
- So, James,
would you schtup you?
- Oh, yeah.
[laughter]
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Robin Mansions.
That's Mike.
And now look at you.
What's your favorite part
of the drag getup?
- He seemed to be very occupied
by my breast plate.
- Oh.
- Liked it.
- Is Mike wearing it now?
- No.
- I swallowed half of it.
[laughter]
- I'm getting, like,
an Al Pacino in drag thing,
and not in a good way.
[laughter]
- Robin Mansions' face
repels beauty.
And I love that.
Nothing makes
a woman feel prettier
than standing
next to this one over here.
- Well, that's why I hang out
with Michelle Visage.
[laughter]
All right, next up,
Phi Phi O'Hara and Gi Gi.
Wow, that's Chris.
Now you are Gi Gi.
You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- What was the hardest part
of the striptease?
- Being fully tucked
and walking in high heels.
- So you were fully tucked?
- I had the elephant all the way
back towards the waterhole.
- Oh, really?
- I liked seeing
the resemblance.
- You look like you share DNA.
You look fantastic.
Great job there.
- I have such a girl crush
on both of you.
- What was the most
difficult part
of working with your daddy mama?
- We really worked
well together.
He's like an inspiration
of what everybody should be.
He's an open-minded,
heterosexual male
that just values people
for who they are,
doesn't judge a book
by its cover.
My dad's not like that.
If I could have a dad like him,
my life would probably
be a lot easier,
and, you know,
I wish I had that bond,
so it's nice to have
a friend like this.
- It'll happen one day.
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?
- Probably not.
And that's okay.
[crying] I'm fine with that.
I just--I hope he values...
like, who I am.
If I can get anything from this,
I'm just--I'm happy he was here
to see that I'm a good person.
That feels so good.
Thank you.
- Thanks, kids.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Latrice Royale
and Sharelle Royale.
That's Leland.
Girl, you come a long way.
- Sharelle is a ho.
She can't even get enough
of herself in the mirror.
- Really?
- Trust.
Look at that.
Do you see this?
- Yes.
- That's gorgeousness.
Gorgeousness.
- The family resemblance,
though,
it ain't up in there.
- You don't see none?
- Well, I...[mumbling]
- I'm different.
- Okay.
- See? There it is.
Now what? See.
- I will follow suit and say
that I'm not seeing
the family resemblance.
It's sort of more of like
here's two friends
in a Tyler Perry movie.
[laughter]
- Next up, Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.
That's Rick.
- Wow.
- And this
is Lil' Mama Michaels.
- Rick, I feel like you and I
could be related.
I feel like we look a little bit
alike if I straighten my hair.
And I'm digging it.
- I don't love the dresses
that I'm seeing here.
I think they could have used
a little more flash,
so I would have liked to see
a little more sparkle.
- Lil' Mama, was this
an unwanted pregnancy?
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause it was the most
somber, macabre,
fricking death walk
I've ever seen.
I was like, oh.
This poor baby.
- [laughs]
- I'm ready to have this baby.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I have, like,
four underwears right now
and, like, two pantyhose.
Even these shoes,
they don't even fit me.
They're glued to my feet
right now.
- Literally glued to your feet?
- They're glued to my feet,
so I can't take it off--
[laughter]
- He can't even kick 'em off.
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
Now while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, kids.
Just between us "goils"...
let's start with Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.
- I loved the striptease.
I loved the walk.
- The runway presentation
was very basic.
Nothing sexy about it at all.
Because Chad doesn't take risks,
it brings Chad down.
- Well, I was enamored with him.
I thought she did a remarkable
job with Lady Samantha.
- Sharon Needles
with Robin Mansions.
- I love Sharon Needles.
I love her energy,
I love her humor,
I love her look.
However, I really thought
Robin Mansions
was a dog of a lady on stage.
- I just feel like she
left her sister out to hang.
- Phi Phi O'Hara
and her sister Gi Gi.
- Phi Phi is
absolutely adorable.
- I-I heart Phi Phi O'Hara.
Love the shoes, love the bag,
love everything.
Love it.
- There was really
an uncanny resemblance.
- Yeah.
- Latrice Royale and Sharelle.
- Oh, the Royale sisters.
- [giggles]
- We're sisters,
but we look nothing alike.
I just felt like they had
a different baby daddy.
- I wasn't a huge fan
of the striptease.
For me, a little lackluster.
- Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.
- I thought little Eva Longoria
was just adorable.
So much charisma,
and I can totally see why
you'd want to bring her back.
- Their pregnancy dresses with
the fur coming out of the top,
the sweater set,
and the marabou trim,
it was all a little bit wrong.
- Kenya Michaels
is a fierce queen.
It's unfortunate that she's
just off her game.
- Silence.
Now bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
You're safe.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Awesome.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you babied your daddy mama
and carried this challenge
to full term.
- Damn straight.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- Whoo! Yeah, girls!
Whoo! Yeah!
- You and your daddy mama
have each won a trip for two
to Las Vegas,
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas,
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.
- Thank you. Mwah.
- And all of our daddy mamas
will receive a $1,000
gift certificate
from Moods of Norway.
Kenya Michaels,
your daddy mama presentation
gave us a case
of the baby blues.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
- Ooh.
-<i> Oh, not again.</i>
I don't want to do Carmen.
I don't want to go home today.
- Sharon Needles...
- You got this.
- You gave your daddy mama
a face only a mother could love.
Latrice Royale,
your daddy mama looked like
a sister from another mister.
Sharon Needles...
you're safe.
- Yes! Yes!
Yes!
- Latrice Royale,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- That's all right, mama.
-<i> I didn't expect</i>
<i>to be in the bottom two,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna turn it out.</i>
It's do or die.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me...
And save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
[applause]
[cheers]
- Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Latrice Royale...
Shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Lil' Kenya Michaels,
it's hard to say good-bye
to a queen like you.
Till we meet again.
Now, sashay away.
[laughter]
- I feel sad because
all the girls have the dream
to win this competition,
and maybe it's not my time.
Don't stop dreaming
'cause all the dreams come true.
- Wow.
The fantastic four.
The future of drag
rests in your hands.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.


<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
music makes the people
come together.
 Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.
 Milan kept talking over
other people.
 '80s, it's about...
[laughs]
 It's getting real damn old.
 Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
Sharon, she has
one good character,
so she might as well
use it.
 Did you work well
with Phi Phi?
 She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
 Sharon Needles...
condragulations.
 Yes!
 You're the winner
of this challenge.
Dida Ritz, shante, you stay.
 Thank you.
 The Princess, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Ladies, you are all
under arrest.
<i>The dolls do hard time.</i>
 Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison

<i> And tempers flare.</i>

[tires squealing]
 Whee!
 Open space.
 Category is...
 Cheesecake!
 I'm sorry, but The Princess
is in another castle.
 "This is the beginning,
the only beginning."
 Dida, I think you should do
the honors,
since you beat her.
 You gave me everything
I needed, honey.
 I'm not gonna lie.
A lot of it came from anger
towards the judges.
I feel like the judges don't
really know me.
I just have to show them
what the entertainer in me
is like.
Next challenge,
I have a lot to prove.
 We have a three-way mirror,
and I just recommend
everybody do a turn
before you step out
on the runway,
because the lumps and bumps
and the bra strap.
 The thing is that I
usually don't pad.
 Somebody needs to teach
a course at the learning annex.
[laughter]
All right?
 Sharon Needles,
how does it feel
to have two wins under
your belt?
 I'm proud of myself.
I showed up here,
thinking I would probably be
the first girl home.
I was prepared to, like,
embarrass my entire drag family.
I can't believe how well
I'm doing here.
I'm getting kind of
used to winning.
Any time I've ever attempted
to run in a pageant,
I'm always last.
And for any one of those
"high class,"
you know, gown and crown
pageant queens
that ever gave me
a raised eyebrow,
who's laughing now?
Ha!
 I figured Sharon would win
this challenge
because I picked a character
for her
that she can excel in.
 Girl, shut up
before I smack you.
[siren]
<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
Friends, you stand
on the shoulder pads
of a long line
of designing women,
golden girls who have
traveled down the road
and back again.
So whether you're looking
for Mr. Big
or just working
for Mr. Jefferson,
America's next drag superstar
needs the will and grace
to do whatever it takes to be
absolutely fabulous.
Now, kiss my grits.
[giggles]
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
 Hi.
 Ladies, you are all
under arrest.
 What are you talking about,
girl?
 For today's mini challenge,
you'll be posing
for a memorable mug shot.
[laughter]
Now, you'll be working
in pairs,
so pick your favorite partner
in crime.
 I looked down the line
and I see one person
just looking, and I'm like...
[sighs]
You're with me, I guess.
What did I do
that was unchristian
that I have Madame
as my default partner?
 Oh, and one little detail.
Instead of doing
your own makeup,
you'll be responsible for
painting your partner's face.
 Oh, God!
 Oh!
 This couldn't possibly get
any worse.
 Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be handcuffed
to each other.
 [gasps]
 What?
[laughter]
 I have been to prison.
I don't plan on going in
no more handcuffs.
 Oh!
 Oh, I like this now.
 Book 'em, boys.
 Not too tight, officer.
 Now, you perps will have
20 minutes
to prep for your close-ups
before the photographer
from Polite and Public arrive.
On your mark, get set, paint.
 Let's go.
 Ooh!
 Ooh.
 Being handcuffed
and having to paint each other,
it's hard.
 [laughs]
 This is sick.
 I know, I need to get
something out of my bag.
I have a great idea
for a mug shot.
Madame's just like,
"Okay, I have ideas too,"
and I'm like,
"Well, we'll use mine."
Put this blue paint
on your face.
Take it and, like,
splotch it on me.
 Okay.
 Willam and Madame,
they both look like
they swallowed the smurfs.
[laughter]
 Willam and Madame LaQueer,
our first pair
of lady criminals.
Wow.
 We robbed a bank.
 Oh, that's the blue stuff.
 It's a dye pack.
 Of course, the dye pack.
 One, two, three--
violate the penal code.
Book her on the cover of<i> Vogue.</i>
Madame LaQueer is busting out
all over.
Toss that salad, girl.
Honey, you got me
scared straight.
Chad Michaels, Sharon Needles.
 Uh-huh.
 Oh!
Oh, dear!
You might need a breathalyzer,
honey.
 It's not my first time
at the rodeo.
 Deliverance!
Serving time!
Attica!
Excuse my beauty.
I was framed!
May I call you
Missy Misdemeanor?
 Yes.
 Don't drop the soap!
Serving time!
Salvation!
Child, you are serving some
Raggedy Ann realness.
It must be 5:00 somewhere,
because you got the shadow,
girl.
 [coughs]
[laughs]
 Acquittal!
Bad boys!
 What you gonna do?
 That's right, honey.
 Busted!
All right, girl.
If the wig don't fit,
you can't acquit.
All right,
that's a wrap...
sheet.
The verdict is in.
One pair is guilty of being
sickening in the first degree.
The winners of today's
mini challenge are...
Willam and Madame LaQueer.
 [laughs]
 Whoo!
[applause and laughter]
 Condragulations, girls.
Hollywood is a tough town.
One day, you're a big star,
and the next day,
you can't get arrested.
Today, you get to be both.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be starring in the new
TV sitcom,<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
 A sitcom challenge
is my day job.
Come on.
I was like, sitcoms?
Oh, check.
 It's about four best
squirrel friends
who keep getting arrested
and sent to jail.
 [laughs]
 This acting challenge is
really exciting for me
because I have
a degree in acting.
This is my moment.
 You'll be competing
in two groups.
Willam, Madame LaQueer,
since you won
the mini challenge,
you'll be team captains.
 Finally, I'm not gonna get
picked last.
 Now, to choose your cast,
you'll be drawing names
from this iron fist shoe box,
which normally holds shoes
designed by yours truly.
Madame LaQueer, you go first.
 Dida Ritz.
 Cheesecake, yeah.
 Jiggly.
 Sharon Needles.
 Latrice.
 Kenya Michaels.
 Phi Phi.
 Milan.
 Milan goes to Madame LaQueer,
which of course means
that Chad Michaels
goes to Willam's team.
Willam, Madame LaQueer,
you are in charge
of assigning the parts.
I'll leave you
to learn your lines.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
 All right, you'll be Karen,
I'll be Charlotte, uh,
you'll be Julia, and...
Kenya is performing Marge,
the guard
because it's just so funny
to see such a butch so small.
 Oh, my God,
Kenya's so fishy,
I don't even think she know how
to be butch.
 Okay, we gotta do
a quick read.
 Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison,
pretty ladies.
Says here you were arrested for
soliciting a "meenor."
 Minor.
 Minor, a minor.
 [clears throat]
 When you're in
a group challenge,
everyone's work reflects on you.
Go over this word with me
a couple times.
Tuckahoe.
 Tuckahoe, tuckahoe.
 Slower, tuck-a-hoe.
 Tuckahoe, okay.
 Soliciting.
 Soliciting a "meenor".
 A minor.
 Minor, minor, okay.
 Are you gonna let her
take over this?
Are you gonna let her direct?
 Girl, are you gonna keep
telling me
what I am going to do
with my group?
If she wants it her own way,
then she can win
a mini challenge
and then direct the group.
 I have to wear the tights
with this?
 Our main challenge today
is acting in a sitcom
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
He said, "Screw it."
I thought I just did!
 [laughs]
 For me, it's a day job.
I'm cool.
 Welcome to Tuckahoe
Prison for Ladies.
As soon as I saw that there was
a prison guard,
I knew that's
the role for me.
Well, hello, gorgeous.
I'll let you hide in my hedges
any day.
 I beg your pardon,
but I'm not into horticulture.
What the fuck Is
horticulture?
 It's the study of plants.
 Yeah.
 [laughs]
I don't know what that means.
That's an S.A.T. Word.
<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>
That's the words
you're punching.
"I'm," 'cause that's you.
 But I'm not into
horticulture.
<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>
What are the most important
words in that sentence?
 I beg your pardon?
 No, no, no, you did it great.
 Leh-leh-leh-lah.
 I've been on sitcoms,
and I know about comedy.
Take your note and move on.
I beg your pardon?
 Just copy that.
Copy exactly how she said it.
 Exactly how they said it.
 I beg your pardon?
 But I'm not
into horticulture.
 But I'm<i> not</i>
into horticulture.
 Maybe I'll give Rose, like,
a Audrey from
<i>Little Shop of Horrors</i><span style="bodyStyle"> voice.</i>
This challenge is comedic
and character-driven.
I'm just starting to think
every challenge
is my kind of challenge.
 I thought you said it was
a Justin Beaver--fuck.
 Oh, my God.
Hell no.
 The other group,
it's weird.
Sharon is talking like
she has something
stuck in her throat.
And it's like,
country bumpkin cartoon.
 It's a little tighter
than I expected.
 An oversized beaver
rubbing up against her kid?
I wonder why she got upset?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are we talking about beavers?
Uh...oh!
 Are you doing an accent?
 Yes, I've got
a British accent.
 It's a little distracting.
Like, I think it might be a
little distracting to the text,
but that's your choice.
 I'm an actor, and I know
how to portray a character,
and that's actually my strength.
I asked the young man
next to me for his napkin
to wipe my friend's
sticky beaver.
 Oh, my God.
That's gonna be stupid.
[laughs]
 Hello, hello, hello!
 Hi, how are you?
 I smell Emmy.
[laughter]
 Whoo, that's correct, mama.
 Hey, kids.
 Hi.
 Hello.
 Team Willam, you have a lot
of TV experience, don't you?
 Yeah, if you name a cop show
in the past ten years,
I've probably been on it.
 And what role
are you playing?
 Karen.
 Oh, is that the slutty one?
 She's man crazy.
[laughter]
 And why'd you choose that
for yourself?
 I'm very Samantha,
and I was on<i> Sex and the City</i>
with Samantha,
so that kind of works.
 Really?
 That's what you gotta do.
That's what you gotta do, honey.
 Latrice, you are playing...
 Large Marge.
 The prison guard.
Now, are you drawing this
from personal experience?
 The tables are turned, baby.
[laughter]
 And Jiggly,
what role are you playing?
 I get to play Charlotte.
 Is that the prissy one?
 The prissy one.
 Now, that--I would never
cast you as the prissy one.
 She said it.
I asked,
"Who do you identify with?"
 I mean, like,
I have my moments,
so, you know, there's things
that I'm just like, eww.
 Okay.
I want to hear how Jiggly
gets prissy.
 I beg your pardon?
But I'm not into horticulture.
 Jiggly, I think you could use
a little bit more work
of identifying
who your character is.
She's not really angry.
She's more prissy.
You got to commit to it;
you got to nail it.
 Okay?
 Okay.
 All right, kids,
get back to work.
I can't wait to see it.
It's very funny already.
 Thanks, Ru.
 All right, good.
Team Madame LaQueer.
 Hi, Ru.
 Madame, are you
a good director?
 I wrote and direct
a play myself twice.
 Oh, boy.
Milan, you're an actor.
How is Madame LaQueer
as a director?
 Um, I think she's a little
laid back.
She could be
a little bit more directorial
with her approach
but, uh, we seem to be doing
a great job.
 Okay, all right, all right.
Sharon Needles,
what role are you playing?
 Rose the idiot.
 Oh, my goodness.
And Madame LaQueer.
 Charlotte.
 Madame LaQueer prissy?
That's gonna be quite
a stretch for you, isn't it?
Wow.
Kenya, what role
are you playing?
 Marge.
 You're the butch
prison guard?
 [laughs]
Yeah.
 That's an interesting choice.
Who made that choice?
 I did.
 You made that choice.
 Yes.
I assigned the roles.
 Okay.
All right, all right.
I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.
Remember that comedy
is precision.
Find the cohesive rhythm
together.
I'm sure you're gonna
work it out.
 Right.
 All right.
Gather 'round, ladykins.
Later, on the set of
your sitcom,
we'll be joined by our
extra special guest judge,
the Emmy-award-winning
co-creator of<i> Will &amp; Grace,</i>
Max Mutchnick.
 Oh!
 Cool.
[applause]
 Awesome.
 Max Mutchnick,
he's a star-maker.
 Break a leg and...
don't fuck It up.
All right, see you later.
 Bye, Ru.
 Bye, Ru.
 I couldn't be more thrilled
that Max Mutchnick is here,
because I've auditioned
for him before,
and I haven't gotten the job,
so I'd like a second chance.
 Jail scene, take one.
 Action.
 Ladies, no one needs to
go to jail for liking nuts.
Why, I have a huge sack.
 Oh, me first, gimme.
 Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.
 Oh, I like mine raw.
 Wait a second,
are we still talking
about peanuts?
 Cut.
Jiggly, wait a second.
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
 Wait a second, period.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
There's a period there.
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
Eww!
 You know, it--yeah.
Let's just keep going.
Action.
 Rose, what in the world are
you doing in that crazy get-up?
When the security guards
were chasing me,
the only thing I could find
to hide in
was this Mr. Happy uniform.
 Well, that's you in
a nutshell, Rose.
 [laughs]
 And cut.
 Chad, you're a pro.
You've obviously been doing it
for 3,000 years.
 [laughs]
 It's really working for me,
okay?
 Thank you.
 Ooh, me first, gimme.
 William.
 Willam.
 Willam, thank you.
 It's spelled right
on my headshot.
It's in there, so it's just
on the way out.
 So, "William," it's just,
make sure you get all the words
in there and--
 Why don't you correct Ru
when he says "William"?
 He's got a $100,000 check.
 [laughs]
 Oh, that's right, okay.
You make a good point.
 Yes.
 Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.
 Oh, I like mine raw.
 Get those nuts
away from my face.
 Latrice, have a good time.
 Okay.
 "Get those nuts away
from my face,"
and then give--
look at the camera.
There you go.
 [laughs]
 I mean, you give us--
I mean, honey,
you could do that
for a half an hour,
and they would laugh.
 Well, I'm gonna let you have
it now.
Okay.
 There you go.
[laughter]
Action.
 Get those nuts
away from my face.
 [laughs]
 I was really tapping into
some serious acting skills there
because Marge
doesn't like nuts...
but Latrice does.
[laughs]
 That's a series.
Latrice in<i> Get Those Nuts Away</i>
<i>From My Face,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this fall.</i>
 [laughs]
 Our main challenge today
is to act in a sitcom
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
 Action.
 Of all the stupid things.
Rose, why did you show up
at the Justin Bieber concert
in this ridiculous costume?
 Justin bie--oh.
I thought you said we were going
to a just--
Fuck.
 You can't do that on TV.
 No, I know.
I'm really good with dialogue.
It's just a real tongue-twister.
 All right, so you want to
just pick it up from--
 Okay, we'll pick it up again,
and we'll have no problems
this time.
 Rose, why did you show up
at a Justin Bieber concert
in this ridiculous costume?
 Oh, I thought you said
we were going to a dress
in beaver cos--gone--
God, that's a fucking hard line.
 No F words.
And can we just make sure
that when you do that line--
 Well, it's a hard line.
I'm saying "dressed in beaver."
 Sharon keeps talking back.
 It's kind of
a hard thing to hear.
 I was like, girl, you need to
calm yourself down real quick.
 Please don't make me go
through that line again.
 Action.
 When was the last time
you washed this thing?
I mean, I nearly gagged
at the stench.
 Mmm, I kind of like
the smell.
Remind me
of high school gym class.
 Cut.
You were doing a one-woman
show out there.
You just seemed like
a crazy person
that's talking to yourself.
 Okay, okay.
 I nearly gagged on that--
on that stench.
 Ooh, I kind of
like the smell.
 Cut.
Kenya, you like
the smell of the beaver,
so don't hold your nose.
You love the beaver.
 I wonder why
she got so upset?
 It was just
a big old country boy.
I mean, that young man
looked pretty mature enough
to handle a beaver on his own.
 Milan, it's "mama's boy,"
not "country boy."
 I wonder why
she got so upset?
 He was just
a big old country boy.
 Cut.
 Sorry.
I mean, that young man looked
pretty mature enough
to handle a beaver
on his own.
 Um, Milan, Milan,
you're kind of
playing to stuff out here.
Be in the scene
with these people.
Look at the person
that you're talking to.
 It is extremely intimidating
to have the creator
of<i> Will &amp; Grace</i><span style="bodyStyle"> critique you.</i>
I thought this evening
was kind of thrilling.
Me and this oversized beaver.
 Milan's not exciting enough.
I didn't want to see
more of her.
I didn't really care.
 Action.
 And then his mother told me
to get my tail out of his face,
and then she really
let me have it.
 Gee, a sloppy, oversized
beaver rubbing against her kid.
I wonder why she got so upset?
 Cut, print, Emmy.
You know how to do a sitcom.
It's what you dream of,
when you're writing
this kind of stuff,
that you come across an actress
who just takes the stuff,
takes it to a better place,
and it's really wonderful
to watch.
 Thank you.
I feel, like, tears almost
coming
'cause I'm doing exactly
what I prayed for,
just to redeem myself.
 Action.
 That was so mortifying.
I "actudentially" spilled a--
ah-la-la-la.
I "actudentially" spilled
a virgin Mary on Rose,
so I asked the, uh, oh!
 Cut.
It's a bloody mary,
not a virgin mary.
 Okay.
 And I asked this young man
next to me for a--
Oh.
I'm gonna go again, sorry.
 LaQueer,
it's really important
that you listen to the director,
okay?
When you make a mistake,
and you're in front of
a live audience,
you got to keep going.
You keep stopping as if
you're allowed to stop.
There is no stopping.
 So I asked the young man next
to me for a napkin
so I can wipe my friend's
hairy beav--
 Ooh.
Ouch.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We are talking about beavers
or--ew!
 Can you do the "ew"
as Lucille Ball, though?
Ewwwwww!
Do it like that.
 Ewwwwww!
 Ewwwwwwww!
 Ewwwww!
 Ewwwwwww!
 Ewwwww!
 Ewwwwwwww!
 Ewwwwww!
 That is a wrap.
Nice work, ladies.
Tomorrow, you'll sitcoms will
premiered on the main stage,
where we will be joined by
one of my favorite funny ladies.
<i>Mad TV</i><span style="bodyStyle"> alum Nicole Sullivan.</i>
 Oh, I love her.
[applause]
 Oh, my God, I'm so happy
Nicole Sullivan's
gonna be a judge.
I can't wait.
All right, ladies.
We will see you tomorrow.
All right, here we go.
all: Bye.
[alarm beeps]
 "Mornking."
 All right.
 All right, time to work.
 Hello, boo-boo.
 So were you guys
sweating it up
in that jail cell yesterday?
Any flashbacks in there?
 I tell you this,
it was nice to be
on the other side of it
for a change,
you know what I mean?
Being in prison gave me
that opportunity
to, like, think about
what my dreams were.
And you know what?
Your choices are to accept it
and move on,
or to beat yourself
up over it.
Everybody makes mistakes,
but, bitch, you better look
sickening when you get up.
Sickening,
and make them eat it.
 Latrice,
can you take us to church?
[laughter]
 We all need a blessing at
this point.
Lord knows I do.
[laughter]
 All right, this is gonna be
good enough.
It's not a pageant.
 It's a pageant for my life.
Every day I'm up for it,
I think "pageant."
 What I said about Phi Phi
on the runway last week
makes me feel bad.
 Did you work well with
Phi Phi?
 She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
Basically what she said is,
"You're spooky,
dress like a monster."
 Come talk to me for a minute.
 What's up?
 Well, I don't know if
any of the other girls
have said anything about it,
but I'd rather have you hear
it from me now
before it turns into
much bigger than it was,
but in the last runway, um,
I was pretty sure I was
in the bottom two.
 Uh-huh.
 So I brought you up,
and I just wanted to
let you know.
 What do you mean,
brought me up?
Brought me up, how?
 Well, basically,
what I said was,
I felt that you kind of
pushed me into, you know,
just doing my spooky look
and that it was irresponsible,
and I thought
it was kind of sloppy, just to--
 Because I told you to do
something that you're good at?
 Well, I wanted RuPaul to know
that if she wanted to say
that I just kept turning out
the same look,
it was because you just wanted
us to be what we always are.
 You're an adult.
You could have came up to me
and said, "You know what?
I don't want to do this."
 I was being realistic.
 Realistic is bullshit,
because I picked out a character
for you
to sit there and do,
and you did it great.
You obviously won
the goddamn challenge.
 Because--because--
 Because of me.
Because I told you
to go in your closet
and dig out
that goddamn gothic look.
So congratulations,
you're welcome,
because I was the one
that sat there
and picked that out for you.
 Okay, well,
if you think that I won
because of you,
you--you are wrong.
 Then what--
what do you want to do?
 It's my talent
that gets me to win.
 Sharon, you know what?
You are not even
on the same level as me,
so get the fuck out of my face.
 That's right, because you--
 Get the fuck
out of my face.
Go back and do your only
one look that you got!
 Oh, I have one look?
Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck You.
 Tired-ass showgirl?
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!
Go back to Party City
where you belong!
 I'm the fucking
future of drag.
You look fucking 20 years ago.
 Oh, girl, please.
 I tried to talk to you
like a sister
and I tried to talk to you
like a grownup.
 We aren't sisters, though,
so I don't ever want you
talking to me.
 Whoa, time to go.
 To sit there
and tarnish my reputation
just because she felt insecure
is bullshit.
Bitch, don't come for me.
 Future of drag.
Fucking tired-ass lame shit.
Future, the future.
[laughter]
[laughter]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
<i>And what?</i>
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, it's that girl,
Michelle Visage.
 You spin me right round,
baby.
 [laughs]
Hey, Billy B., what's happening?
 You look sickening.
 Thank you, darling.
Max Mutchnick, how are you,
darling?
 Thrilled, and you get points
for just getting the name right.
 [laughs]
And Nicole Sullivan.
I'm so glad you're here.
Now, what would the Vancome
Lady say about my makeup?
 Looks like Little Orphan
Annie sat in the sun too long
and then got a boob job.
 [laughs]
Now, this week,
the queens were challenged
to play classic
sitcom character types,
and tonight,
they're all dolled up
for their television premiere.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
 Up first, Phi Phi O'Hara.
She's so vaginal in white.
 If I'm gonna go
to red carpet,
I want a gorgeous gown
that everybody's gonna be, like,
"Ooh, that's Phi Phi."
 I see her halo.
 And that dress has wings.
Latrice Royale.
I see the Beverly Hills, Billy.
 [laughs]
 I'm blinging;
I'm feeling beautiful.
This is the sheer elegant side
of Latrice.
 I think Latrice has a
Cable Ace Award up her sleeve.
 Or she's just happy
to see you.
 Uh-huh.
Dida Ritz.
Wow, she's on fire.
 I'm all about showing body
and leg.
I am working it.
 She's walking like
she has somewhere to go.
She's got a meeting
in the ladies room.
 Madame LaQueer as Folk.
 [laughs]
 I'm going for something
I would actually wear
to a event premiere.
 Lainie Kazan's sexy sister.
 Kirstie Alley
better watch out.
Willam, serving
a little Taylor Swift.
 I chose some
Vivienne Westwood
because the only thing that
matters on the red carpet is,
who are you wearing?
 I love it accidentally
fell off the shoulder.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
 "Did my boob fall out?"
 Standards and practices
will hear about this.
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
 Work, Lil' Kenya Braxton.
 Yes.
 I feel amazing.
I'm a model.
This is my moment.
 A pineapple smoothie.
 Delicious.
Chad Michaels.
 Ooh!
 Very Florence
and the Machine.
 The dog days are over.
 I'm wearing a tribute
to the Tudors,
the Renaissance,
and I just felt really gorgeous.
 Take it all in, darling.
Up next, Jiggly Caliente.
 This is Brooklyn prom,
bitches.
 The girls that are edgy,
young Hollywood,
they don't wear
evening gowns all the time.
This gal looked pretty.
 It's always jiggly
in Philadelphia.
 [laughs]
 London, Paris, Milan.
All righty, man.
She's playing her gold card.
 It feels like I've been
poured in gold,
and if there was
a female version of the Oscar,
it would be me.
 She's just a bond girl.
 Octopussy.
 Sharon Needles.
 I kind of wanted to ham it up
and dress like an old lady.
 And she's so generous
with her fans,
signing autographs.
 I think Carol Burnett
found her diva.
[laughter]
 I'm so glad we had
this time together.
Welcome back, bosom buddies.
Let's tune in to
an all- new episode
of<i> Hot in Tuckahoe,</i>
the one with the beaver,
starring team Madame LaQueer.
 Of all the stupid things.
Rose, why did you show up
at the Justin Bieber concert
in this
ridiculous costume?
 Justin bie--oh!
I thought you said we were going
to a "dress in beaver" concert.
[canned laughter]
 When was the last time you
washed this thing?
I mean, I nearly gagged
at the stench.
 Mmm, I kind of
like the smell.
It remind me of
high school gym class.
Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison.
Pretty lady, so I hear you
were arrested
for soliciting a minor.
 That was so mortifying.
I accidentally spilled
my Bloody Mary on Rose,
so I asked for a young man
for his napkin
for me to wipe
my friend's sticky beaver.
 Did somebody say "beaver"?
[canned cheering]
 Finally, a big, strong man
who could get us all off.
[canned oohs]
 Now, let's all
put our heads together
and get this thing licked.
[canned cheering]
 Well, it's not gonna
lick itself.
 And my beaver is dirty.
[canned laughter]
 Are we talking about beavers
or...
[horror movie music]
Ewwwwwwwww!
[canned applause]
 [laughs]
 I think we did
a pretty good job.
We delivered.
 Team Willam, it's time for
another episode of
<i>Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
You know, the one with the nuts.
 Of all the dumb ideas, Rose,
what made you think that
we could break into a nut farm
in the middle of the night?
 Well, Julia,
I was having such a bad day,
and the only thing
I could think of
to make me feel better
was a big mouthful
of Mr. Happy's tasty nuts.
 Welcome to
Tuckahoe Prison for Ladies.
Says here you were caught hiding
in the hedges.
Mmm, well, hello, gorgeous.
I'd like to let you hide
in my hedges any day.
 I beg your pardon,
but I am not into horticulture.
[canned laughter]
 Hey, guard, you seem like
a gal that loves nuts.
 Back off, chickapee.
I'm allergic to nuts.
Tried 'em once,
almost gagged to death.
 Did someone say "nuts"?
[canned cheering]
 Finally, a big, strong man
who can get us all off.
 No one needs to go to jail
for liking nuts.
Why, I have a huge sack...
[canned oohs]
Right here.
 Oh, me first, gimme.
 Hey, get those nuts away
from my face.
[canned laughter]
[canned cheers and applause]
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking about
peanuts or...
Ew!
[canned laughter]
[canned cheers and applause]
[theme music]
[laughter]
 Ladies, the ratings are in,
and one team was, in a word,
dy-no-mite.
 [laughs]
 The winning team is...
[suspenseful music]
Team Willam.
 Ah!
[applause]
 Condragulations.
But one queen in particular
was serving must-see TV.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
[suspenseful music]
Latrice Royale.
 Oh!
[applause]
 Condragulations.
You will receive a cruise,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
 Thank you so much.
I'm finally in the game.
I can get a little bit
of recognition
for what I've been doing.
That makes me feel incredible.
 Team Willam,
you are all safe.
You may leave the stage.
 Let's go.
 Bye.
 Team Madame LaQueer,
you've got some 'splainin'
to do.
First up, little Kenya Michaels.
Now, Kenya, you were playing
Marge, the butch guard.
Was that your interpretation
of butch?
 I was trying to be a Butch.
I tried to look like a man,
but--
 [laughs]
 There was nothing butch
about you.
 Runway was great.
You looked beautiful.
 So pretty, easy-going,
and I "lurv" the dress.
 Thank you, Kenya.
Next up, Milan.
Now, you're a trained actor,
aren't you?
 Yes, ma'am.
 Tonight, you are like
a stunning black Emmy award.
As for your performance,
I think you got lost,
and I think you were acting
all by yourself.
 You needed to
take it further.
It's always better to be told
to take it down
than it is to pump it up.
 Thank you, Milan.
Madame LaQueer.
Now, tell me about watching
yourself in the sitcom.
 I think I lost my accent.
 What accent
were you going for?
Can you give me an example?
 Of course.
I was going for this accent
because I am an uptight
and prissy woman.
 Hmm.
 Ah.
 You were working on an accent
that I don't think
worked for you.
I think that you were stretching
maybe a little bit too far.
 Thank you.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
 I think you could be sexier
and prettier,
and I think it's the hair
that is the issue.
 If you're going bare legged,
lotion up, girl.
Lotion up.
 Let's get to
the acting yesterday.
You have "it."
There's a quality.
It just comes out of you.
That's something
that cannot be taught.
 All right, thank you, Dida.
 Thank you.
 Sharon Needles.
 Hello, RuPaul.
 Here's my concern.
The whole thing,
the whole package
is just a little too jarring.
 This isn't the first time
I've caused concern
for being too far
out of the box.
 This is a little bit of what
happened yesterday.
You had something to say
about everything
that I had to say.
I need to know that you're gonna
take the notes,
not that you're just going
to say to me,
"This is just who I am,
and take it or leave it."
That throws up a flag
for a guy like me.
 Ladies, thank you.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Now, just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
 I think she's so, so pretty,
but it's my least favorite thing
to watch as an actor,
when they're just
really consumed with
how they look
instead of how they're acting.
 Why were you looking at me
when you said that?
 [laughs]
 Anyway.
 I think she was miscast in
the entire challenge.
 Madame LaQueer was the leader
of that group.
 She made some piss-poor
casting choices.
 Let's move on down to Milan.
 Kelly Rowland
better watch out,
but so should the crazy lady
at Coldwater Park.
This is a person
that talks to the sky
and tells imaginary
friends to watch out,
'cause she's coming.
 I was sort of shocked to hear
that she was trained.
I would have expected someone
who'd been trained a lot
would have been
a lot more at ease.
 All right, moving on down
to the team leader,
Madame LaQueer.
Well, she decided to give
herself a European accent.
 I legitimately thought she
was Russian.
 [laughs]
 This actress was not paying
attention.
She seems like a sweet lady,
but not for show business.
 All right, moving on
to Dida Ritz.
 I really was impressed
with the raw skill.
Dida has that innate ability
to sound sitcom.
 This is America's
next drag superstar.
This is $100,000.
I should not be having
to tell a queen
her hair needs to be bigger
and her legs
need to have lotion.
 All right, let's move on
to Miss Sharon Needles.
 My limited, sort of,
exposure to her,
I thought she was
kind of quirky and cool.
 I don't like the name.
I don't like the look.
I don't want to see a sitcom
starring the little girl from
<i>The Ring.</i>
 [laughs]
All right, silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some
serious decisions.
Dida Ritz, you're safe.
 [mouthing words]
 You may join the other girls.
Madame LaQueer, the judges
were mad about you,
but not in a good way.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
 I don't know why
I am in the bottom two.
There are people that actually
deserve to be here
in this position before me.
 Sharon Needles...
[suspenseful music]
You're safe.
 Thank you.
 Is there anything
you'd like to say?
 I've spent my entire
adulthood creating a situation
where I didn't have to
answer to people
and, you know, I'll
really work on taking directions
in the future.
[sniffles]
 Sharon, you may join
the other girls.
Kenya Michaels...
You are safe.
Milan, I'm sorry, but you are
up for elimination.
 Being in the bottom two,
it's a terrifying rush.
 Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[Trouble</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
 In lip-syncing for your life,
you have to try to
take the other person down.
 I am really trying to
deliver the goods
that a drag superstar
should deliver.
 The pointer sisters
are the girls
who just point during
their lip-sync,
and Madame is
just a pointing queen.
She's a pointer sister.
 I'm just exploding
in energy at that moment,
because I don't want to go home.
 Madame LaQueer
wasn't doing much,
and I'm like, girl, Milan
just danced circles around you
and Swiffered the floor
with his taint.
 I don't understand why people
take their wigs off.
It's a drag show, not wig wars.
[cheers and applause]
 Ladies, I have made
my decision.
[suspenseful music]
Milan...
Shante, you stay.
Milan, you may
join the other girls.
 Thank you.
[sniffling]
 Madame LaQueer, my queen,
hold your head high
and know that you represent
Puerto Rico
at its fiercest.
 Thank you so much
for this opportunity.
I wouldn't trade it
for anything in the world.
 Now, sashay away.
 This is history
in the making.
I'm proud to be part of it.
I made it.
I made my dream come true.
This is only the beginning.
 My prime time nine,
condragulations.
You are all kings of queens.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
 all: Amen.
 All right,
now let the music play.


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Tired-ass showgirl.
- At least I am a showgirl,
bitch.
Go back to Party City
where you belong.
- I thought this evening
was kind of thrilling.
-<i> Milan's not exciting enough.</i>
I didn't really care.
- Get those nuts away
from my face!
- Cut, print, Emmy.
- Latrice Royale,
condragulations.
- Ah.
- The color green
reminds me of fungus.
-<i> Milan, shantay, you stay.</i>
Madame LaQueer, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Cock-a-doodle-Ru!
[chicken clucks]
-<i> The queens lay an egg.</i>
<i>And you'll be seeing double.</i>
- [laughs]
- That is not what I want to see
in my drag queen.
-<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Ross Mathews</i>
<i>and Loretta Devine.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- I get Madame's hangers.
- Oh, jeez, I get the heads.
- Madame LaQueer is gone.
The room's starting to feel
a little bit empty.
<i>"Chad, Sharon, Milan, Dita</i>
<i>equal true friends."</i>
- Oh, my God.
Wait, we're not true friends.
<i>I don't care.</i>
<i>She was a mess.</i>
Sorry about it.
- What'd it feel like to be
in the bottom two?
- I felt my freakin' age.
Thank God I survived.
I don't want to be judged
because of it.
- Bye, Madame.
all: Bye.
- It's a new day.
- You swept it all up yesterday.
- Yes, you did.
- You swept it all up.
-<i> So now that I have this win</i>
<i>under my belt,</i>
<i>I feel like I'm finally</i>
<i>in the game.</i>
America's next drag superstar
will be a big bitch.
- Well, now Kenya is the only
Puerto Rican here.
- I really thought it was gonna
be me and you at the bottom.
- Yeah, maybe I go
to the bottom too,
but my runway goes good.
<i>I don't scare.</i>
Mama, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
Rawr!
[alarm sounds]
- Yeah.
-<i> You've got shemail.</i>
Are you a high roller
or a Hollywood square?
Because I got a secret.
If you press your luck,
you could be queen for a day.
But if you continue to wipe out
the competition,
honey, you could be going home
with all the tic-tac-dough.
Survey says, the joker's wild.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
For today's mini challenge,
you'll be pitted
against each other
in a series of grueling
physical stunts
for the brand-new game show
we call<i> Beat the Cock.</i>
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.
- Now, we'll play three rounds
with three contestants each.
The winner of each round
will go beak-to-beak
in a "cocktacular" finale.
And the one<i> Beat the Cock</i>
champion
will win a phone call home.
-<i> Oh.</i>
- Tomorrow is my eighth
anniversary with my partner,
Adam, and that would mean
the world to me
to be able to call him
and tell him I love him.
- Now, this first round
is Cock-A-Doodle-Ru.
First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
All right, now,
the object of this game
is to pin these chickens
on my face.
Whoever gets the rooster beak
closest to my mouth wins.
Ready. Set. Cock-a-doodle-Ru.
- Oh, shit, okay.
-<i> That's more of an earring.</i>
- Pfft!
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
Cock-a-doodle-Ru.
- [laughs]
-<i> Yes!</i>
[laughter]
Contact.
- I'm sorry.
-<i> Next up, Jiggly Caliente.</i>
- Oh.
- Damn, I got it in my hair.
-<i> That means Phi Phi O'Hara</i>
<i>is our winner.</i>
All right, round two, kids.
The object of the game
is to get a single feather
across the finish line.
You can only use your breath.
If the feather hits the ground,
you need to go back
and start all over again.
On your mark. Get set. Blow.
-<i> Go, Dida. Blow!</i>
-<i> Oh, oh, one down.</i>
Starting over again.
- What the fuck?
<i>It's really hard.</i>
-<i> Yes, Dida!</i>
[all cheering]
- [laughs]
-<i> Dida Ritz is our winner.</i>
Round three, Choke the Rooster.
[chicken clucks]
<i>Now, ladies, the object</i>
<i>of the game</i>
is to get as many rings
around that cock.
<i>On your mark. Get set.</i>
<i>Choke the rooster.</i>
<i>Aim for the head.</i>
-<i> Oh!</i>
- Wow, Milan.
- Milan is our winner.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Now, for the final
championship round,
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara, Dida Ritz,</i>
<i>Milan,</i>
you've got to lay an egg.
<i>Now, the object of the game</i>
<i>is to carry these raw eggs</i>
<i>through these wig heads and lay</i>
<i>them safely in your basket.</i>
And you need to carry these eggs
between me down there.
<i>On your mark. Get set.</i>
<i>Lay an egg.</i>
<i>Now, the first queen</i>
<i>to lay three eggs wins.</i>
<i>Tossed salad</i>
<i>and scrambled eggs.</i>
<i>Ooh.</i>
<i>- Damn!</i>
-<i> Egg drop soup, anyone?</i>
[all cheering]
-<i> I keep dropping my damn eggs.</i>
I'm not happy about this.
[laughter]
- Oh!
[all cheering]
-<i> Phi Phi has laid two eggs.</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Get it, Phi Phi.</i>
-<i> Phi Phi is one egg away.</i>
<i>Phi Phi has laid her third egg.</i>
<i>Our winner is Phi Phi.</i>
[chicken clucks]
You'll get your chance
to make a phone call home
<i>a little bit later.</i>
- Yeah.
- Ladies, for this week's
main challenge,
the password is...
<i>Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Well...
[all cheering]
- Now, this is your chance
to show off
your best celebrity
impersonation
and channel someone else's
charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
for a change.
-<i> One word, living legend...</i>
[imitating Cher]
Get into it, babe.
- I expect to be blinded
by stars.
Gentlemen,
start your impressions,
and may the best woman win.
- So what's everybody doing?
- I'm doing Wendy Williams.
- Diana Ross.
- How you doing?
- Yes.
- I'm doing Gaga.
- What about you, Kenya?
- Beyoncé.
- No, I'm--no.
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what she's thinking.</i>
<i>I love Beyoncé,</i>
<i>but she's not funny.</i>
I'm scared for her.
- Well, may the best woman win.
- I really want you to have
my phone call.
- Are you sure you want
to do that?
Because I feel funny about it,
Phi Phi.
- Honestly, I really wanted
to win it for you.
- Honey, thank you so much.
- Yeah.
-<i> I'm really excited</i>
<i>that Phi Phi's gonna give me</i>
<i>her phone call.</i>
It was really unexpected,
and it was really sweet.
I owe you a big one, girl.
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.
- You're my sister.
- See, you're not
a complete bitch.
[laughter]
- Who are you doing?
- Well, I'm doing, uh,
Michelle Visage.
[laughs]
Vintage Cache!
[laughs]
<i>I thought it would be memorable</i>
<i>poking fun at one</i>
<i>of the judges.</i>
<i>I think a lot of the girls</i>
<i>wouldn't go there.</i>
When in doubt, freak 'em out.
<i>Too much?</i>
Miss Michaels,
is it too much for her?
- Oh!
- [laughs]
-<i> Sharon is doing</i>
<i>Michelle Visage,</i>
which, I mean, that's not
a smart idea at all.
- Hilarious.
-<i> Now finally the judges</i>
<i>are gonna see</i>
<i>that she clearly has no talent.</i>
<i>Sharon should just pack up</i>
<i>and go home.</i>
Bye.
- Don't push it too far
where you're gonna insult them.
<i>Girl, she's gonna see this.</i>
- Let her.
- Who are you doing?
- I'm gonna do Diana Ross.
-<i> You are?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.
<i>I mean, I'm used to doing,</i>
<i>like, Donna Summer</i>
and Kelly Rowland and--
you know, and those people
aren't like, "Ah!"
You know, so...
- Yeah, and we're left
with Miss Ross.
- Right.
[laughs]
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>is really exciting for me</i>
because my drag is sort of based
around characters
<i>and impersonations.</i>
My plan is to really have fun
with Diana today.
- Are you nervous this week that
you have to step up your game?
Like, the judges have their eye
on you?
- Maybe, but I choose Beyoncé
because it's more easy for me
doing that character
because I know it.
- You don't think, like, doing,
like, a Latin character
would work in your benefit?
- I can do Shakira,
but I don't like the character.
- I have the wig
if you want to do it.
- Yeah.
- I just hope that they get
funny from it.
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah.
-<i> Kenya'd be my sister</i>
<i>in how close we are.</i>
<i>I am worried.</i>
I wanted her to do something
with an accent
so that way,
it wouldn't be a handicap.
Beyoncé's not really funny,
you know.
She takes her career
really seriously.
<i>So I don't know how Kenya's</i>
<i>gonna make it happen.</i>
- Okay, we are what?
- Pretty sisters.
- Thank you.
- Well, Beyoncé and Gaga
should sit next to each other
on the...
- Yeah, I need to share it.
- Maybe I'll let you use
my telephone.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- I'm so excited.
- To think that, you know,
Cher's gonna see you doing this.
- I picked Cher because
it's what I'm most known for.
- You'll clock someone
doing Cher wrong.
They always do it too big.
- Show me one tape where Cher
went, "Oh!"
She never did that.
That's, like, a stupid thing
that people make up about Cher.
Cher's, like, much more subtle.
Cher's above it all,
you know what I mean?
-<i> I love Chad to death,</i>
<i>but the bitch</i>
likes to talk about Cher
way too much.
- Cher's got a great sense
of humor.
Cher doesn't give a shit.
Cher is a one-word diva.
- She's gonna drive me crazy.
- I know she's got a great
sense of humor.
- Well, don't you think
this is where
you're gonna run into a problem,
sweetie?
- With what?
- You're too afraid
to make fun of Cher.
- You know, the stakes for me
are very high.
<i>People are expecting me to</i>
<i>bring a certain level of skill</i>
<i>to the table, and I don't want</i>
<i>to screw it up.</i>
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hello.
- Now, I've come to investigate
a case of identity theft.
- Oh, shit.
- Let's get to it.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi, Ru.
- I want to know who you're
doing in<i> Snatch Game.</i>
- Um, Gaga.
- Wow, that's a risky choice,
because you know in the past--
- It's been done.
- It's been done,
and the girl who did it
wasn't able to convey--
'cause what is her personality?
- Well, she's always about,
you know,
her fans and monsters
and paws up.
- I know, you're making it
sound very simple,
but I think it may be
a little more difficult
than what you're thinking.
- Well, I do Gaga a lot,
<i>and I've been hired</i>
<i>all over United States</i>
to impersonate her.
- All right.
- I've been recognized a lot
for my Lady Gaga.
<i>So I think Ru is gonna love it</i>
<i>and eat it up.</i>
- All right, get back to work.
- I surely will.
- All right.
Well, hello, Dida Ritz.
- How you doing?
- Oh, well, there you have it.
Do you know enough
about Wendy Williams?
- I do know some things
about her.
- She watches this show,
so you better be on point.
- I hope I am.
- Right, because she's got a few
trademark signature moves
that she does,
but then, inevitably, you have
to be quick on your toes.
- Yes.
- Have you ever heard her
radio show before the TV show?
- The one and only time I've
heard it is when she actually,
I guess, got into an argument
with Whitney.
- Well, let's--
give me a little sample.
I'll play Whitney.
- Okay.
- You play Wendy Williams.
- Okay.
- Uh, yeah, I heard you been
talking about me.
What's that all about?
- Well, first of all,
how are you doing?
- No, I'm doing fine, sister.
God is good.
God is good. God is good.
- God obviously isn't that good.
You've been getting
in a lot of trouble.
- Bobby Brown. Bobby Brown!
- Yeah, Bobby Brown's not gonna
help you right now, honey.
This is you.
How are you doing?
How you doing?
- I heard some Wendy in there.
- Yeah, so...
- That's very good.
- Thank you.
- Commit to the character.
I want to see it bam onstage,
okay?
- I'm gonna make sure I go
as far as possible.
- Good.
All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thanks.
Latrice Royale.
Who are you playing?
- Aretha Franklin, baby.
- Oh, of course.
Wow.
How are you gonna make her
come to life as a personality?
- Well, you know she's a diva.
I just kind of play off of
what she's done and--
- Yeah, you have to convey
Aretha Franklin
in, really, a few seconds.
- Right.
- And I'm not clear
on how you're gonna do that yet.
- Aretha is not really known
for catchphrases
and being funny and a comedian,
<i>but she's had</i>
<i>some funny moments.</i>
I'm pretty confident
that I can do this one.
<i>I got this.</i>
-<i> All right.</i>
Well, let's hope
that the risk pays off.
Good luck.
Get back to it.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Little Kenya Michaels.
-<i> Hola.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Who's your character?
- Beyoncé, the queen bee.
- I've heard of her.
- I'm trying to do
a sick Beyoncé
that have involuntary movements
that is crazy.
- I see.
<i>It's a risk</i>
<i>because of the accent,</i>
and, you know, if you were gonna
do a Latin star,
you would have a little bit
of an advantage.
- Beyoncé is a girl
that is very sexy girl.
- Yeah.
[both laugh]
I feel good in this.
- You're gonna do Beyoncé,
and you're taking a risk.
I hope it pays off for you.
- I'm gonna work it out.
- All right, get back to work.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
-<i> Thanks.</i>
Hey, Willam.
- Hi.
- Who do we have here?
- Jessica Simpson.
- How do you play
Jessica Simpson?
- Jessica doesn't understand
jokes much.
She says stupid stuff,
but she just does it
because she doesn't know better.
- I see.
Are you a fan of hers?
- Who?
- [laughs]
All right, Willam, I'm gonna let
you get back to Jessica Simpson.
I cannot wait.
- Thanks, she's sleeping.
- Oh, she's asleep.
Okay, well, let's let her sleep.
Get back to work.
- Bye. Thank you.
- Milan.
- Hello, Ru, how are you?
- Hi, honey.
Ooh, big hair.
Is it Chaka Khan?
- It's gonna be Diana Ross.
-<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>
You know, last week, you found
yourself in the bottom two
as an actor portraying
a character.
How will you convey
your character this week?
How will you sell Diana?
- Well, I think, um, I was
taking it too small, you know,
and I need to just--
it's better to tell someone
to pull you back,
and hopefully I won't go so far
that it's like a true
caricature.
- And you got to make her funny,
'cause<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is about</i>
spontaneity and humor.
- Okay.
- All right, Milan, get to it.
- Thank you.
- All right.
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>
- Hey, RuPaul.
- Now, who on Earth could you
possibly be playing?
- My main lady, Cher.
- Cher.
- Yes, sir.
- Wow.
- Honestly, Ru,
everything in my life
has been because of Cher--
I mean, all the places
I've gotten to go,
the people I've gotten to meet,
the clothes on my back,
and I'm really looking forward
to doing her the justice
that she has done for my life.
I basically just owe her
everything.
So it's really important to me
not to offend her.
- [imitating Cher]
All right, I'll see you later.
-<i> All right, babe.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Sharon Needles.
- Hello, Ru.
-<i> Who are you portraying?</i>
- I'm not sure
if you know her at all,
but I'm doing, um,
Michelle Visage today.
- Oh, well, you know
you're supposed
to be portraying a woman.
- Oh, yes, I know.
This is gonna be
a little difficult for me,
but, uh...
- We say that with love,
of course.
- Yes, of course.
- What mannerisms of hers
are you gonna--
- I'm just gonna bring
a lot of harsh vocals
with a Jersey sense,
a lot of cackling.
[laughs]
This is where I completely
disagree with Santino.
- She's a fierce queen.
And it's quite a risk,
'cause she's gonna either
love it or read you for it.
- Right, right, right.
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous,
but I think I'll do her justice.
- All right, Sharon Needles,
get back to it.
- Thank you.
- All right, ladies, listen up.
At today's taping, you'll be
playing the<i> Snatch Game</i>
with our extra-special
guest judges,
late-night hot potato
Ross Mathews...
- Yay!
- Yes!
- And legendary actress
of stage and screen
and original dreamgirl
Miss Loretta Devine.
[cheering and gasping]
- Wow.
Loretta is the shit.
<i>She not only acts well.</i>
<i>She sings well.</i>
She's the real deal.
- So don't fuck it up.
Welcome to the new<i> Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hello, I'm your host, RuPaul.
Now let's meet our contestants.
This intern has climbed his way
up the Hollywood ladder.
Please welcome funnyman
Ross Mathews.
<i>I'm so happy you're here.</i>
- Oh, please, I'm thrilled.
- Up next, please welcome
the multitalented--
Loretta Devine is here.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hey, Loretta.
You are a national treasure,
my dear.
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- And now let's give
a Hollywood hello
<i>to our star-studded panel.</i>
Now from the best show
on television,
welcome my squirrel friend--
Michelle Visage is here.
Hey.
- I might not be
the biggest star here,
but I got the biggest knockers,
okay?
[laughs]
- Up next, a great idol of mine,
the one and only Diana Ross.
- Yes, Ru, mwah, mwah.
I love you.
But call me "Miss Ross."
- Milan's makeup looks crazy.
I've never seen Diana Ross
look like she's cracked out.
- Next to her is singer,
actress, shoe designer,
entrepreneur Jessica Simpson.
- You won.
- Oh, she's got a piece
of her product hair there.
- It's synthetic.
You can use it to Swiffer
and everything.
-<i> Oh, okay.</i>
Very good pitch there.
Very good pitch.
- You're welcome.
-<i> You're welcome.</i>
- [laughs]
- Let's give some R-E-S-P-E-C-T
to the queen of soul,
Miss Aretha Franklin.
- So glad to be here, Ru.
- What is that you're eating
over there?
- Something that really
satisfies me.
- Oh, okay.
Did you bring enough for
everyone to share, Re-Re?
- Oh, no, baby, I don't share.
-<i> Oh, she don't share.</i>
<i>All right, all right.</i>
Straight from the<i> Jersey Shore,</i>
Snooki is here.
- Hi, Ru.
Ross, are you a juicehead?
- I could try it.
- Oh, my God, I want to smoosh.
- Okay!
- Next to her, the one and only,
the mother of all monsters,
Lady Gaga is here.
- Work it, girl!
Give a twirl!
Give a twirl, give a twirl,
give a twirl!
- Next to her,
the queen of all media,
<i>Wendy Williams is here.</i>
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
It's nice to see you again.
- We've got 16-time
Grammy winner, hey, Beyoncé!
- Whoo!
- She's had a top ten hit
in every decade since the '60s.
<i>She's done it all.</i>
The original dark lady,
Cher is here.
- I've been there, done that.
I spread La Mer on my toast
in the morning.
All right, you know,
I'm Cher, bitch!
[laughter]
Ooh.
-<i> Yes, you are.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- I don't care.
Ross, Loretta, I ask a series
of questions.
Our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.
<i>You come up with an answer</i>
<i>that you think</i>
<i>will match our celebrities.</i>
First question
is for Loretta Devine.
Ugly Edna is so ugly,
<i>when she goes</i>
<i>to the beauty parlor,</i>
they beat her face with blank.
- A picture of herself.
- Let's see if we can get
a match.
Michelle Visage.
- All right, Ru, I said
a baseball bat.
Remember, it was '87, we used to
take the J train into Manhattan,
and you used to carry
a baseball bat
before we would work
Susanne Bartsch's party.
We'd make a buffalo nickel
for it,
and it was all we used
for protection.
- No match, Michelle,
but a very good effort.
Thank you very much.
All right, Wendy Williams.
- How you doing?
- Ugly Edna, beat her
in the face with?
- I love Cher, and I'm gonna say
with Cher's plastic surgeon,
'cause look at Cher.
- Allegedly.
Allegedly.
- She looks good, I mean--
- Cher, I love the hair change.
- Thank you, I can't go five
minutes without switching a wig.
I love 'em. I love 'em.
- Sasha Fierce.
- I want to take a sleepy
right now.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- How's she doing?
[laughter]
- I'm a survivor!
I'm a survivor!
- She's a survivor.
-<i> Kenya is taking it</i>
<i>to the extreme.</i>
- Oh, girl.
- So I need to step up my game.
It's just I don't want to be
flatlining.
-<i> Ross Mathews, you are next.</i>
The real housewives are so fake,
when they make whoopee,
their blanks don't move.
- Their Goldbergs don't move.
-<i> Very funny.</i>
All right, let's go to Snooki
from the<i> Jersey Shore.</i>
- Just like my friend JWOWW,
her tits don't move.
-<i> Her tits don't move.</i>
Beyoncé?
- Wake up.
-<i> Oh, is Beyoncé asleep?</i>
Beyoncé, were you sleeping?
- It's the medication.
-<i> That's no excuse.</i>
You should have seen
what me and Ru were on
at the Limelight.
<i>It's all behind us now.</i>
We were on uppers, downers,
and candy corn.
- [laughs]
All right, Cher, I see
you're wearing your Academy--
well, actually, you did not win
the Academy Award that year.
- I didn't, but I'm wearing
the shit out of this headpiece.
I paid a lot for it, so...
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
- Those girls are real sleazy.
Their scabies, crabs, and fleas
don't move.
- I'm afraid that's not
a Goldberg, Ross.
- No.
- Loretta Devine,
Fatty Patty is so fat,
when she gets on the scales,
it says blank.
- Ouch, ouch.
- Ouch!
Good answer!
What'd you say, Michelle?
We have a match?
- I said, "Hello,
Madame LaQueer."
- [laughs]
I told her not to wear green.
I hate it!
- Diana Ross, the boss.
- When she got on that scale...
- Yes.
- It said mahogany.
- Ooh.
- The men love me.
The women love me.
They all love me.
-<i> This was a real heavy</i>
<i>Diana Ross.</i>
This is like Diana Ross
about 4:30 in the morning
<i>after a couple packs</i>
<i>of cigarettes.</i>
-<i> Unfortunately that is not</i>
<i>a match.</i>
All right, Jessica Simpson.
Fatty Patty's so fat, when she
gets on the scale, it says...
- Oh!
- [laughs]
-<i> Oh.</i>
- These young people, see,
they don't have no respect.
-<i> No respect.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- No respect!
- This next one is for Ross.
Dumb Dee Dee is so dumb,
she thinks the C word
is short for blank.
- She thinks the C word is
short for Kardashian with a C.
That's how dumb she is.
-<i> That's how dumb she is.</i>
- Stop!
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.
Lady Gaga, she thinks the C word
is short for?
- The crown.
The new diva crown.
Just so you know, the diva here,
not her, not her.
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
- But now I have the diva crown
'cause I bought it from her.
- I just want to say
to Lady Gaga
that I am the only boss here.
- I don't even need to fight
my own battles
when I have my own monsters
to take care of it for me.
Rawr.
- All right, let's move on
to Miss Aretha Franklin.
- Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!
Snooki want smoosh,
smoosh!
Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!
- Oh, how's she doing? Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my goodness.
- The level of
unprofessionalism, far too much.
- [imitates flatulence]
- What did you just do?
Did you just--
- You nasty bitch.
- One more time.
- This is disgraceful.
- All right, Beyoncé,
calm your ass down.
- This is worse than when I had
Omarosa on my show.
Get off me!
- Stars, listen up.
Shy Sheila is so shy.
- How shy is she?
- She's afraid to blank
in public.
- Oh.
- Yes, write it--write it down.
<i>Loretta Devine?</i>
- She's afraid to swallow.
- Swallow in public.
- Yes.
- 'Cause she's shy.
- Shy.
- I have a very shy gag reflex
myself.
[laughter]
Aretha Franklin,
you still down there?
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh, your blood sugar's
going down?
- I don't got any more food.
-<i> You don't have any more food.</i>
- No more snacks.
I can't be bothered.
I am completely over the fuckery
that was going on
<i>in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Snatch Game.</i>
-<i> Cher.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes, Ru?
- We're looking for swallow.
- Shy Sheila is so shy
that she's afraid to...
I don't give a rat's ass
because this game
is boring the shit out of me.
I don't know why they book me
on these chicken shit gigs.
[laughter]
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.
- Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Unfortunately, we've run
out of time.
<i>Now, on behalf of all</i>
<i>our stars,</i>
don't forget to spay and neuter
your neighbor's pets.
Thanks for joining us
on the<i> Snatch Game.</i>
See you next time.
Bye.
- There is such a thing
as going too far,
and it's unfortunate.
- I'ma gonna win!
I'm gonna win.
- You're not getting shit.
- Miss Cheesecake.
-<i> This morning, I'm still</i>
<i>feeling very emotional,</i>
very heavyhearted, angry,
disappointed.
I've never been so embarrassed.
The<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was horrible.</i>
I felt like it was
a three-ring circus,
romper room bullshit going on.
- So what happened yesterday
at<i> Snatch Game,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girls?</i>
- Yeah, what the hell
did happen?
It got a little crazy.
- I thought that<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
was the most romper room fuckery
that I've ever experienced
in my life.
I could not believe
the shenanigans
that was going on
in the front row.
Completely unprofessional.
Completely childish.
And that is not what I came here
to do.
- I don't know where
my character went.
It started off right,
and I don't know what happened.
Did I make a mistake?
Yes.
- Well, it wasn't just you.
Even though Jiggly apologized,
I don't even think she was
the worst of the bunch.
- We know that nobody did
anything out of malice,
but everybody
wants the spotlight.
Some of the younger people,
I think,
should have been a little more
sportsmanlike about it.
- I just want to bitch slap her
because she doesn't know
what she's talking about.
I mean, at her age,
she shouldn't be such a bitch.
- Well, I think overall we
realize that today is a new day.
Bring your best; deliver what's
needed for this competition.
- Bring our breasts?
- Yeah, bring your breasts.
- Okay.
- [laughs]
- All right, you guys,
I'm gonna go call Adam.
[dialing, line rings]
Hi.
-<i> Hi.</i>
<i>Oh, baby.</i>
- Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.
-<i> Happy anniversary.</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>
- Thank you.
It's just, I feel like I've been
gone forever.
Oh, my God, I miss you so much.
-<i> I miss you too, baby.</i>
- I'm gonna wear the giraffe
bodysuit that you made today.
-<i> Fun.</i>
-<i> Being able to talk to Adam,</i>
just knowing that he's still
there thinking about me
and rooting for me,
it was good for my soul.
- I like my Gaga, so that's
all that matters.
I guess because I saw
how some people
were going over-the-top...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- That I was nervous.
Like, okay, well,
am I not giving enough?
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- I'm really concerned
about my position here
because I've been consistent
throughout
this entire competition so far.
- This is a problem, girl.
I don't want to go home.
- I don't want you to go home.
- But I'm gonna put that little
wig in my hair today
and go amazing.
- That's all we can do.
- [laughs]
[applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, guys.
-<i> Hey, Ru.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hey!
- Will the real Michelle Visage
please stand up?
- Here I am.
- No, you're not the real one.
- I swear!
- [laughs]
Shake the dice and steal
the rice, Santino is here.
- Why so blue, Ru?
- Ross Mathews,
how are you tonight?
- I'm fantastic.
I love you in a feather.
- Oh, this old thing.
Loretta Devine.
You look like a million bucks.
- Thank you, Ru.
You look fabulous.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
This week, we challenged
our queens
to give us their best
celebrity impersonations.
Tonight, they've come to the
main stage dressed to impress.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Jiggly Caliente.
Someone's getting lucky
at the prom.
-<i> I am classing it up</i>
<i>in my blue gown.</i>
<i>I feel and look amazing.</i>
-<i> Breakfast at Jiggly's.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
-<i> From</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Jersey Shore</i><i> </i>
<i>to Jersey housewife.</i>
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>
-<i> Rawr.</i>
-<i> How many giraffes had to die?</i>
<i>- Right?</i>
-<i> I'm giving you</i>
<i>some giraffe realness,</i>
<i>and I'm free to just stomp</i>
<i>the runway,</i>
<i>no strings attached.</i>
-<i> I love the peekaboos.</i>
-<i> The peekaboos are fabulous.</i>
-<i> Hello, they're saying hi.</i>
-<i> Milan.</i>
<i>Yes, I can, Janelle Monae.</i>
-<i> Or Bruno Mars on Red Bull.</i>
-<i> When I'm on the runway, I feel</i>
<i>like I'm on the tightrope.</i>
<i>And so I really wanted</i>
<i>to embody that essence,</i>
<i>and I wanted to have fun</i>
<i>with that.</i>
-<i> I hope Louis Farrakhan</i>
<i>don't see this.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Oh, Willam.</i>
-<i> Leather and lace.</i>
-<i> Damn, girl.</i>
-<i> My safe word is "yes, please."</i>
[laughter]
-<i> My outfit is very</i>
<i>hard-core '90s,</i>
<i>Grace Jones,</i>
<i>fetish blow-up doll.</i>
-<i> That's a Tarantino dream</i>
<i>right there.</i>
-<i> What are you gonna do,</i>
<i>arrest me for all this ass?</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
-<i> Is that a shoulder pad,</i>
<i>or is she just happy to see me?</i>
-<i> Darling, those are</i>
<i>$25,000 pyramids.</i>
-<i> This is my style.</i>
<i>This is my drag.</i>
<i>This is what I'm known for</i>
<i>and what I like to do.</i>
-<i> Assume the position,</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz, black Barbie doll.</i>
-<i> Somebody get a dollar.</i>
<i>She got stuck</i>
<i>in the claw machine.</i>
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
-<i> I'm feeling like I am at</i>
<i>a Patricia Field show.</i>
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>my teddy bear skirt.</i>
-<i> No animals were harmed</i>
<i>in the making of Dida's skirt.</i>
-<i> No. Love a plushy.</i>
-<i> [laughs]</i>
-<i> Kenya Michaels.</i>
<i>Oh, the champion is here.</i>
-<i> Boricua!</i>
<i>- Puerto Rico!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>
-<i> Boxing is one of the most</i>
<i>important sports</i>
<i>in Puerto Rico, and this</i>
<i>costume represents who I am.</i>
-<i> Float like a butterfly,</i>
<i>sting like a queen.</i>
<i>Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>After a little lunchtime</i>
<i>procedure.</i>
-<i> I'm obsessed with people who</i>
<i>have extreme plastic surgery,</i>
<i>and through the art of makeup,</i>
<i>I can temporarily be</i>
<i>that Janice Dickinson</i>
<i>or that Amanda Lepore.</i>
-<i> Yes, just a little bit more.</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Oh, oh, oh.</i>
<i>Now it's prefect.</i>
-<i> Just a little prick</i>
<i>in the mouth.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Oh, Latrice Royale.</i>
-<i> Oh, elegant.</i>
-<i> In royal blue,</i>
<i>and Royale is she ever.</i>
-<i> Yes, bitches.</i>
<i>This is what she's serving,</i>
<i>honey.</i>
<i>This royal blue dress</i>
<i>makes me feel</i>
<i>the most beautiful</i>
<i>that I've ever felt, ever.</i>
-<i> I own everything.</i>
-<i> Fabulous.</i>
-<i> And those are my girls.</i>
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>
This week, you all snatched
our attention,
some for the better
and some for the worse.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
<i>Jiggly Caliente.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
Latrice Royale.
You're safe.
You may leave the stage.
- [mouthing words]
- Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- The consistency
in your version of Cher
throughout the entire game
was just spot-on.
I was LOL'ing the whole time.
- I really responded
to this animal print.
Looks really futuristic,
looks really new.
- I especially love
the yellow hair.
I'm thinking about
getting me some.
[laughter]
- It's yours if you want it.
- Thank you, Chad.
Next up, Willam.
- Your Jessica Simpson--
so funny, so perfectly empty,
and you did it in a way
that I think
would make Jessica Simpson
laugh.
- If she could turn her TV on.
-<i> [laughs]</i>
- Willam, let me tell you
why I'm having a problem.
I feel like I don't
know you yet.
I love the way you get onstage.
I love the way
you hold your character.
Now I want to see
what else there is
besides this fierce-body bitch.
- I tend to think that emotions
are for ugly people.
- No!
No, we do have them,
but so can you.
- All right, next up,
Milan as Diana Ross.
- I had trouble with the makeup.
<i>She looked a little cross-eyed</i>
<i>at times.</i>
- You just didn't have
the Diana demeanor.
She floats,
you know what I mean?
She's like Febreze.
It's just better.
- You were like Chris Rock.
Like, how much it cost
for one rib?
-<i> This ensemble tonight,</i>
<i>I like that you had</i>
so much reverence
for Janelle Monae,
but I see you as a man.
<i>The suit, the pants, even,</i>
<i>the saddle shoes--</i>
it all reads as boy.
- Well, I mean,
this is what she wears,
and I really want to stay true
to Janelle's look.
- Bottom line, it's still
a drag queen competition,
and you're giving us drag king.
-<i> Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
- The thing about Gaga--
and I'm a huge fan--
<i>is, you picked someone</i>
<i>who's all visual,</i>
and it kind of fizzled.
- I'm not a big fashion icon
or anything,
<i>but the shorts seem like it</i>
<i>should have been cut up higher.</i>
<i>Yeah, like that more.</i>
Those look like old
swimming trunks I used to wear.
[laughter]
- Sharon Needles, tell me about
your runway look tonight.
- You know, I have an obsession
with plastic surgery.
I love to look at people
that have it.
I mean, that's why Chad's, like,
<i>one of my new best friends,</i>
<i>you know?</i>
- Speaking of plastic surgery,
you chose to do Michelle Visage.
- What?
- Now, I'm very excited
to get to Michelle
to hear what she has to say.
- I'm not as old as you wanted
to make me, bitch.
- I have no idea.
- But with that said...
I thought it was brilliant.
Keep doing it.
- I just want to say, you know,
thank you all
and I love you all,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
[laughter]
- Kenya Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I was very confused
with your Beyoncé.
<i>It was really frantic.</i>
The gyration movements
and the body snaps,
<i>that and the medication,</i>
it just didn't have anything
to do with Beyoncé.
- You're kind of a knockout
tonight
<i>in a little sequin</i>
<i>boxer outfit,</i>
but I worry you KO'd yourself
with your Beyoncé yesterday.
- Okay.
-<i> Thank you, Kenya.</i>
And thank you, ladies.
<i>While you enjoy</i>
<i>an Absolut cocktail</i>
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>
All right, judges,
just between us "goils,"
<i>what do you think?</i>
Let's start with Chad Michaels.
- The planning, knowing
that she was gonna change wigs
and kind of give you
a new version of Cher
all equally funny.
- But I almost feel like
that was safe for Chad.
- It wasn't something safe
for Chad to do
because Chad really had
something to lose here.
You know, a lot of pressure
on Chad, and did he deliver?
Absolutely.
- Absolutely.
- I like what Sharon Needles
did more.
Now, yes, I know she played me,
but...
[laughter]
It's got nothing to do
with that.
She didn't think traditional.
<i>She definitely was not</i>
<i>a suck-up.</i>
She made me older and harsher...
and cheaper.
- Now that I've actually met
Michelle,
I think she could have had
more hair,
greater makeup,
I mean, bigger tits, even.
[laughter]
- Hey, let's talk about Willam.
-<i> Willam's quite an actress.</i>
Really committed to the
character of Jessica Simpson.
It was really funny.
- I always know
she's gonna throw back,
<i>so that's exciting to watch.</i>
But there's so much under there
that I don't even think Willam's
ready to let out.
I'm not gonna be able
to root for her
until she shows me that
a little bit.
- Right, that vulnerability.
Milan, I had a problem
with the suit.
<i>If the suit were a woman's</i>
<i>suit, it would be different.</i>
- I felt like I was watching
Sammy Davis Jr.
- Uh-oh.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- That is not what I want to see
in my drag queen.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where did Kenya Michaels
go wrong?
- Well, first of all,
she made Beyoncé crazy.
- What was that Beyoncé?
- I know.
- It felt very uncomfortable.
- Maybe she just doesn't have
enough references
in her repertoire
to pull out something
that's believable and funny
and--
-<i> That's what drag is about.</i>
You have to have a knowledge
of pop culture.
All right, let's talk about
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She took some heat tonight
because of her runway look,
and also her Lady Gaga was
nothing to write home about.
- It just wasn't good.
- I like her, but she missed
the mark on all counts tonight.
- All right, silence.
Bring back my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
- Yes, ma'am.
- This week,
you hit the jackpot, baby.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
<i>You've won a custom gown</i>
<i>from Marco Marco.</i>
- Thank you all so much
for recognizing me.
It means the world to me.
- Thank you.
Willam, Sharon Needles,
you're safe.
- [sobs]
I've never had, like,
girlfriends.
I've never really been friends
with other drag queens.
I've always been an actor on TV.
I was on<i> Boston Public</i><span style="bodyStyle"> with you.</i>
And I'm getting to know these
girls, and they're awesome.
And it sucks to know
that one of them
is gonna have to go home
so I can win.
It's hard.
So yeah, that's it.
And I'm not acting.
Swear to God.
- All right, ladies,
the three of you
may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Kenya Michaels,
impersonating Beyoncé
is not your destiny, child.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I feel bad
because I can't believe
that I go to the bottom two.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, your Lady Gaga
was on the edge of gory.
You're safe.
- [sobs]
-<i> It's very important</i>
<i>for you to understand</i>
<i>we're looking for the top.</i>
<i>There's $100,000 at stake here.</i>
<i>The world is watching.</i>
Bring your A game.
I'm telling you, Phi Phi,
you better come harder.
- I will.
- All right, you may join
the other girls.
Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
- I was pissed.
<i>It's the second time.</i>
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
<i>Good luck,</i>
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[Vogue</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
-<i> Straight out the gate,</i>
<i>Milan's head is on the floor.</i>
<i>His legs are in the air.</i>
And I'm like, uh-oh,
this could be bad.
-<i> Kenya is so fierce,</i>
<i>and all I can think of</i>
<i>is, pay homage</i>
<i>to the people who lived</i>
<i>in the vogue world.</i>
-<i> I feel good.</i>
<i>It's about an attitude.</i>
If you have an attitude,
your booty move.
[laughter]
-<i> It is so intense</i>
<i>watching this</i>
<i>because they're both</i>
<i>very high-energy performers.</i>
It's tough to call.
I don't know who's going
to take this.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.
Milan...
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Kenya Michaels, for a little
queen, you pack a big punch.
And now the world knows
you're a knockout.
Now...sashay away.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
-<i> I'm not sad, really.</i>
For me, the<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is an amazing experience.
<i>All the Puerto Rican people,</i>
<i>be proud of my work.</i>
I'm a champion.
-<i> My crazy eights,</i>
<i>condragulations.</i>
<i>Remember, if you can't</i>
<i>love yourself,</i>
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
I want you to meet some dilfs.
- Whoa!
- Or...
"Dads I'd like to frock."
- [chuckling]
You know who you look like
right now?
Rick James.
[laughter]
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, you?
- Good.
Don't talk to my dad.
That's what I like, 'cause that
way I can school these hoes.
- Phi Phi loves to come for me.
Come for me, baby.
[cabaret music]
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- Whoo! Yeah, girl!
- Latrice Royale...
shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
Sashay away.
[inaudible]
And tonight,
the queens get catty.
- And it's any bitch's game.
- You're on stage, lying,
is what you're doing.
- I'm not lying.
- Bullshit.
- With extra special
guest judges
Rose McGowan and Wynonna Judd.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win!
- We are back in the workroom
this morning.
Kenya's gone again,
and we're sad, but we're kinda
glad that she didn't knock
any of the fantastic four
out of the running.
- [imitating Kenya]
"Girl, I say bye again."
[laughter]
- Read the whole thing in
that voice.
- "When I left this competition,
I feel loved.
"I love you and the winner is...
I don't know."
- Yes.
[laughter]
- I'm pretty sure she just
forgot to write my name.
- Well, we talk about
consistency,
and I consistently wear some
nonsense on that runway.
- It makes total sense to them.
- I think they're just holding
us to our own personal standard,
and they want to see
that you are...
- [sighs]
- Completely pushing yourself,
but that you are yourself.
- I want to go out as
Sharon Needles just one time
and see what happens.
- Yeah, and get read.
They're gonna be like, "You"--
- Ohh--
- Hey, it's all about risks.
- I come out as a freak too.
I used to do Club Kids.
But this is about being
America's next drag superstar.
And a superstar should have some
finished hems on their garments.
Oh, um, I won a trip to Vegas,
just in case y'all missed that
on the stage.
- Bitch, you gonna be
on vacation a lot, bitch.
- Where's my vacation?
All I wanted was a cruise.
- Shut up, stupid,
you're not getting one.
- It's your second time
in the bottom.
- Yeah, second time
in the bottom.
But you know what?
If you're not on the top at this
point, you're on the bottom.
But some of us
have not lip-synched--
- Girl, I can't help it
if I'm consistent.
- Oh, "I'm consistently
perfect."
- I brought my A game
to this competition.
If perfection is the worst thing
that people can call me,
then call it.
- Well, they don't want you
breaking a hip up there, girl.
[siren blares]
<i>- Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
<i>Hello, my pets.</i>
- Hi, baby.
<i>-</i><span style="bodyStyle"> If life's a ball,</i>
I say go fetch it, girl.
<i>Because it's a drag-eat-drag</i>
<i>world out there.</i>
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>a queen's best friend</i>
<i>can be a real bitch!</i>
<i>[barking, panting]</i>
[all laughing]
Hello, hello, hello!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- For today's mini challenge,
we're gonna have a good
old-fashioned bitchfest!
- Ooh.
- And we're gonna do it
with puppets!
- Everyone loves puppets.
- Everyone loves puppets!
First, you pick a puppet
that represents
one of your competitors.
Second, you drag it up.
Third, you and the puppet
have a bitchfest.
First up, Sharon Needles.
Reach inside that black hole
and pick your puppet.
- [chuckling]
- Careful, there might be
teeth in there.
- [gasp]
Ms. Chad Michaels.
- The resemblance is uncanny.
Next up, Latrice Royale.
- Oh, of course!
I got Sharon Needles.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- You better get some spray tan.
- He needs glasses.
I don't think my puppet
really looks like me.
He's, like, albino,
and then he has black hair.
I don't have black hair,
and I have a mohawk.
That was not my puppet.
- So Chad has Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Wah, wah.
- "I'm old."
[laughter]
- Last but not least...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- A little black baby.
[laughter]
- You have 20 minutes
to drag up your puppet.
On your mark, get set, go!
- Ah!
Gimme some black,
and some black,
and then gimme some more black
'cause that's Sharon
Needles, down!
[giggling]
- I'm gonna kick your ass, Chad.
- Why? What did I do?
- Bitch, I'm not that orange.
- What the hell?
Sharon's doll look like
a burn victim.
I guess it's plastic surgery
gone wrong.
- All right.
Time's up.
Let the bitchfest begin!
- Hi, Ms. Michaels.
"Oh, hi, Sharon."
You're just a vision
of perfection.
"But Michelle Visage
wants me to show
"some rough and tough looks
looks on the runway.
What does that bitch
want out of me?"
I think you look perfect,
especially your silicone work.
"Sweetie, getting silicone
removed from your face
"is about as hard as getting
a cigarette around here.
Can I get a fucking cigarette?"
[laughter]
- Hey, Sharon, good to see you.
"Fuck off."
No, really, girl,
what's going on?
"I don't strive for perfection.
I can just basically--
"you know, you see this dress?
I made this dress,
"and it's basically shit.
"And they just love it.
They love it. They eat it up.
"But you know what?
"I didn't get
my fucking cruise.
Where's my fucking cruise?"
Well, girl, just calm down
because you're kinda spooky.
"Well, thank you, Latrice.
Fuck off."
Okay, thanks.
- I certainly never tell anyone
to fuck off.
- Hi, Phi Phi,
how are you doing today?
"Um, I just wanna say
that I love everybody.
[giggling]"
You know, I'm always afraid
I'm gonna snag my costume
on your tooth, girl.
"[gasp] Oh, my God,
"I can't believe you went there,
Chad Michaels.
I'll get you later."
And what about your wig,
Phi Phi?
It's really pretty,
but haven't you worn that
like three times already?
- My snaggle tooth
is not that big,
and that puppet
looked nothing like me.
- Well, maybe you
could get the help
to help you out
next time, Phi Phi.
"I am not a racist.
I do not know why you guys
keep harping on that."
Yes, you're right, Phi Phi.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sure America's
just gonna love you.
[laughter]
- Oh, it's on, bitch.
Nah-ah.
- Chad got some shade
that lies deep within, honey.
- Hey, Latrice,
how are you doing?
Oh, is that your new single?
"Yeah, I'm the
Barry White of drag."
Oh, and that's, like,
a real beautiful necklace.
Where'd you get that from?
"Well, my friend
Lashauwn Beyon--"
[bracelet breaks, falls]
[all cackling]
- Oh, Lord Jesus.
- Oh, girl, this is awkward.
We should probably go.
- Yay!
[laughs]
- Ladies, you let it all
hang out.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi, we won, I love you.
- Condragulations.
You're the baddest bitch
in town.
- Thanks, Ru.
- All right, ladies,
in the great tradition
of<i> Paris Is Burning,</i>
for this week's main challenge,
we're throwing
our first-ever Bitch Ball.
- Oh.
- What?
- And you'll be doing it...
doggie style.
[dog barking]
First category,
daytime dog park realness.
[dog yaps]
- Oh.
- Second category is...
pooch in a purse party girl.
[dog yips, whines]
Third category is...
canine couture.
[dog barks]
A high-fashion look
inspired by a real-life dog.
[all gasp]
- Puppy!
- Babies!
How cute.
- Oh!
- Meet your fashion inspiration
and runway partners--
Filan, a Chinese crested.
Cali, a standard poodle.
Babyface, a Pomeranian.
And Hunter, a bloodhound.
Chad, since you won the mini
challenge,
you get to match each queen
with her dog.
- Hi, Hunter.
We're gonna do
opposites attract.
- I knew you were gonna
do that to me.
Bitch!
Ugh!
- Little baby!
- Oh, a little baby.
- So Babyface is with Latrice.
- You're beautiful,
but you're kinda edgy and crazy.
- Come here, Cali.
- Cali goes with
Sharon Needles.
- And I'm gonna take you,
you little beauty.
- Chad is partnered with Filan.
Ladies, you can use
your own drag,
plus furry fixin's
we have provided, and...
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
iron fist shoes.
[dog barks]
I think Phi Phi might be
in heat.
- Wow, Phi Phi.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best bitch win!
- [barking]
- Whoa!
[laughing]
- [sigh] I'm already tired.
- See, this is a mess.
This is how you steal my heart
right here.
- We're all just bonding
with our dogs,
and I'm noticing that Phi Phi's
dog is a real handful.
- [sigh]
You're impossible.
Stay here for like five seconds.
Ah! Ooh!
- You know, Hunter seemed
to take a liking to Phi Phi.
- Ugh, you're drooling
on my artwork.
- Phi Phi's dog
is helping her draw.
- I definitely got
the worst dog.
I mean, who really wants
to fashion their clothes
after a bloodhound?
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Chad,
why would I be mad at you?
This is a competition.
- Well, you're the only one
that really looks at it that way
right now.
- Sharon, I don't need
your two cents.
- I didn't do it
to fuck you over.
- I didn't say you did, did I?
- I know, but you
just seem, like, mad.
- Chad--she's full of crap.
She knows that I'm one of
the strongest competitors here,
and so she's trying to get me
out of the game.
[dog growling]
- Don't be mad, girl.
- Girl, shut up.
- She just told me to shut up.
[dog barks]
- Get inspired.
Tell me what I should use.
You like this?
Do you like this fabric?
- Mwah!
[dog whining]
For today's challenge,
we need to create
three distinct looks
for the Bitch Ball--
dog park realness,
puppy in a purse,
and canine couture
inspired by a dog.
[dog yips]
Who's yappin'?
- Is that Willam
dropping names over there?
[dog yips]
- Shut your yapper.
You guys, I think Phi Phi
might be pissed off at me...
for giving her that bloodhound.
- Well, she's not happy
about it.
- If the shoe was on
the other foot,
she would have tried to get us
with her dog decisions.
- I didn't do it
to fuck anybody over,
but it's also I fucking won the
challenge, so it's up to me.
- True that.
- This is a competition.
I can't be preoccupied
with how Phi Phi's feeling.
- I know you're excited
I'm back.
- Sss!
[dogs whimpers, yips]
- I know he had a plan.
He can deny it as much
as he wants, but I mean,
in the end, I'm still
gonna win this challenge.
- [laughs]
- Oh, how did you get off?
Come here.
Oh.
Come on, let's go back.
- Oh, girl.
- Did she step on your
white fabric, girl?
- Yeah, she got paw prints
on everything.
- It's gonna be an adventure.
Get into it.
- Sharon, how do you feel
about this challenge,
like, are you glad you got
the standard poodle?
- To be honest, I did kind of
want Miss Michaels' dog,
just because there's so many
beautiful shades of...
- So pretty.
- Beige and gray and mauve.
I mean--
- That's why I got it.
- That dog's wearing
all my colors.
- This is gonna be so different
to see you in white, bitch.
- In white.
Well, I mean, you usually
don't see a dark lady
in the dog park during the day.
- White's not really my color.
Like I always say,
"Send me to hell.
I don't look good in white."
It definitely
is making me nervous.
And I'm not gonna be able to,
like, rely on my shocking makeup
because it's gonna have to work
with three separate looks.
This will be somewhat
of a challenge.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hello.
- You look like you could use
a little pup talk.
- Ha.
- Ha ha.
- Hey, Latrice.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, Babyface.
Now, you've gotten heat in the
past from the judges--Santino--
- I have.
- About your styling
and your fashion sense.
- Yeah.
- Are you worried
about that at all?
- No, not really, because the
things that I have sewn myself,
people have raved about.
- Good, 'cause you are in
the final four!
- Oooohhh!
- But I gotta say...
there's no room for excuses
or mistakes at this point.
100,000 coins, darling.
- Yeah. And I need every bit
of all of that.
Because my life has been
such a roller coaster
and I've been so unstable
for so long, this is going to,
like, put me where
I'm supposed to be.
Being in prison,
I lost everything.
And it was hard.
But that 100 grand, baby...
that can buy some stuff.
- Remember, we wanna see
a storyline on the runway.
I'm gonna let you get
back to it.
Bye, Babyface.
[laughs]
That bitch is ignoring me.
- [laughs] Thank you, Ru.
- Well, hello, there.
- Hi.
- Are you making love to Filan?
- I've got puppy love.
- [laughing]
The judges in the past--
Michelle--
have said, you know,
that you're...
sometimes too polished.
What does that mean to you?
- I don't know what that means,
Ru, honestly.
I didn't come here
not to be perfect.
- I think she wants
more depth from you,
and this is the perfect
challenge for that.
What are you gonna do for your
daytime dog park realness?
- It's going to be
almost a little bit
<i>Little House On the Prairie.</i>
- Well, that's not particularly
a modern look.
- You'll--it's gonna work out
really well.
- We're asking you to be
fashion forward.
You've got a lot of work to do.
I'm gonna let you and Filan
get to it.
See you in a minute.
- Okay.
- Sharon Needles and Cali.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. So tell us about
your canine couture
inspired by Cali.
- I guess I'm kind of going
for a tight body suit
and then use the fur
as maybe like a big bolero.
- That's interesting.
- I think I am going to be
gold and tan tomorrow.
I'm running out of pale
foundation, so...
[both laughing]
- Are you transforming into
someone we don't know?
- Well, you know, um...
we'll have to see.
- That's interesting to hear.
We're down to the best
of the best.
You and Cali have
a lot of work cut out for you.
So I'll let you get
back to it, okay?
- No problem, thanks.
- Well, Phi Phi and Hunter.
How are you kids getting along?
- Well, I mean,
it was difficult at first,
but he's calmed down and he's
allowed me to work, so...
- [laughing]
Right.
So have you controlled
his saliva?
- Oh. Oh, no.
- Is that your inspiration?
- Absolutely.
A sticky, wet mess.
- Tell me about your
dog park realness.
- I really wanna take you,
like, to Paris...
- Ooh!
- And like poodle skirt
type of look, so...
[hunter whines]
- But the poodle skirts
are from the '50s,
and you've got a bloodhound.
- I'm gonna intertwine
both of those, like, styles
to make one look.
- Well, you know,
we really want the costumes
to speak for themselves.
We don't really want
a lot of explanation.
- Okay.
- Now, have you seen
<i>Paris Is Burning?</i>
- I've seen parts of it.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you've got you homework
to do, don't you, young lady?
You know what the ball scene
is all about, right?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm familiar with it.
- Have you ever walked a ball?
- No, but I've been asked
many times to do it.
- In what category?
- Face--
- But you didn't do it.
- I haven't done it yet, no.
- Ah.
- All right.
You get back to work.
- I have a lot to do.
- Bond with hunter.
- We have.
He's taking a nap.
[both laughing]
So...thank you, Ru.
- All right, ladies,
gather round.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges.
She's no bitch, but she plays
one on TV and in the movies.
Rose McGowan will be here.
- [gasps]
- I love Rose!
- Yes!
- Really.
- And the platinum-selling
country superstar
who's always best in show...
Wynonna Judd will be here.
- Wow!
- I love the Judds.
I love Wynonna's music.
She's a kickass
rock and roll chick.
- In addition to modeling your
three doggy-style outfits,
there's just one more
little thing.
[dog yaps]
[dramatic chords]
You'll need to perform a
Broadway-style opening number.
- Bitch, I ain't got time
to do this.
We're trying to pull these
three looks together.
- Think<i> Cats,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> but,</i>
you know, with dogs.
Chad, since you won the mini
challenge, you're in charge.
- Shit! Is Ru serious?
Is he trying to kill me?
- Ladies,
the dog days aren't over.
In fact...
they're just beginning.
So don't fuck it up.
All right, bye.
[dog whimpers]
- All right, bitches.
It is time to rehearse the dance
routine for the Bitch Ball.
Let's do some blocking.
Kind of my idea's for Phi Phi
to start, like, maybe...
center?
- And maybe we should
kind of be in hidden pose
until we're supposed to animate.
- Or maybe you're just
sitting there like...
- Yeah, scratching fleas
or you know how theater,
how things are completely still?
- I kind of like the idea of
everyone being animated.
Maybe we could do--
- Well, you're in charge, so
just pick, and let's get to it.
- I would like you to do a pose.
- All righty, go.
- Or sideways.
As we get up on our first line,
move up with Phi Phi.
- So maybe we just crawl up
to one point for our line,
and then we...
- Okay, this is how
it really should go,
like a real show.
Because this makes no sense.
So when we're singing our lines,
all of us should get
into our four spots,
and we should land here,
just like we're in a musical.
Or else it's gonna
look like crap.
I'm kinda not having it,
because I really just want
to get all my stuff done,
and I really just
wanna make sure that this
rehearsal goes fast.
all: Whoo!
[dramatic chords]
- You're traveling this way,
and then you can just,
like, slide in--
- I was the one
that was chosen to lead,
so girlfriend really needs
to calm down
and let me
get a word in edgewise.
You can stay where you are,
but we'll come in front
and then you can, like,
bust through to the front.
- No, that's too long, Mary.
- We're talking about the first
part before we move.
- Why are we talking
about that
when we were just discussing
the second part?
- So that we can get
our transitions
all clear for everybody.
- But we're not transitioning
right there.
That's what we just practiced.
- It is so tense right now.
I can't take too much
more of this,
so let's clear it on up.
Here we go--five, six,
seven, eight, bitches.
- And to...
- Ah.
- Does everybody
feel good about this?
- Ow!
[dog whining]
- Don't eat it!
- So much to do.
- Yeah. The house down.
- This challenge is
a little bit intimidating
just by the sheer volume of
the work that we have to do.
I mean, that's three looks.
That's a lot of styling
and sewing and hair.
[dog whining]
- It's gonna be quite
interesting
on that runway tomorrow.
I'm just thinking about how much
I'm gonna whoop Chad's ass
in this challenge.
- You're hungry, honey.
- You're damn right, I'm hungry.
I don't understand what makes me
so much more hungry
than you guys, though.
- We feel you behind us
pushing us down the stairs.
I saw that movie, girl.
- Yeah, I'm a hungry bitch.
I mean, this is a competition.
There's so much at stake.
There's so many opportunities
form this.
They are just concerned because
they know that I'm here to win.
I love everybody.
- Famous last words.
- I do!
- That's what
the puppet head said.
- [laughing] Shut up.
[Latrice laughing]
- What do you think, Needles?
- Diva!
It's fantastic.
- What do you think?
- Gorgeous, darling.
Turn around.
Let me see it.
Work!
Work.
I still have to sew
a complete dress tonight.
- Ha.
- My original concept was to
create a bolero on a leotard.
Then I realized
I've never sewn a bolero.
Feel like I need some
methamphetamines
to get this project done.
- Just say no, Needles.
- One down.
What do you think
of this boot, Phi?
- [laughs]
Um, it's very much a poodle.
We've been working on our
outfits for a while,
and the only thing
that Sharon has accomplished
is he glued some fur on a boot.
- Phi Phi, can I steal you
for a minute?
Mama, come here for a minute.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- I'm exhausted!
[whispers]
I've never done a hem.
Do I just fold it?
- Yes.
- I know I have three looks
to put together
and on top of that,
sewing a new outfit.
It's just the straw
on the camel's back.
God damn it, my fabric got
caught in my machine.
- Sharon's in trouble.
I think that top four
is her stop.
This is where you get off,
Sharon Needles.
- [grunts] Uh!
[alarm buzzing]
[razor whirring]
- And back to work.
- Poomp!
- It's a dog-eat-dog world.
- Today, we're getting ready
for RuPaul's Bitch Ball.
We know that one of us
has got to go today,
so everybody's
a little bit up in arms,
and trying to pull it out
real quick.
- It's gonna be top three
after this.
- I know.
The stakes are really high
right now, you guys.
- [sighs]
I'm gonna lose my damn mind.
- Well, we don't want
to spin off the board.
I'm feeling not so confident.
I'm not sure, this time,
if it's gonna be enough
to keep me
out of the bottom two.
- Miss Michaels,
remember how psychic I was
when we first got here?
- Oh, my God!
- It was so creepy.
- You guys, this bitch
literally predicted
the whole sitcom
and mug shot challenge
before it happened.
- Told ya I was a witch.
- [laughs]
- Sharon.
- Uh-huh?
- Since you're miss clairvoyant,
who's the top three?
- I predict it will be Latrice,
and Miss Michaels...
and...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- And you're saying this
based on...
- Off you know, my energies...
- Oh, whatever!
- That I am collecting deep
into my, uh, subconscious.
- Are you sure that's not
because you don't feel
so confident?
- I'm probably the most worried,
but do I want to be in
that top three?
Absolutely.
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, well,
you look well-groomed tonight.
- Bitch, please.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice, you dirty dog.
- [barks]
- [laughs]
- Rose McGowan,
you look beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.
I love your roses.
- Black roses.
- The best kind.
- And one of my doggone
favorite singers,
Wynonna Judd is here.
How you doin', mama?
- I like it rrrough.
- [laughs]
[imitates scooby-doo]
- [laughs]
- This week, our queens
unleashed their talents
and created three
doggy-inspired looks.
Are you ready to get this
Bitch Ball rolling?
- Ready.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Ooh...
- Ugh.
- Ew.
- Girl.
[laugher]
- Let the Bitch Ball begin.
Category is...
daytime dog park realness.
Latrice Royale.
Hey, girl.
Give a dog a bone.
- [laughs]
- I made a little, fun skirt,
a little slinky top,
and some cute pumps.
Bitch, honey, this is what I'd
wear out to the dog park.
- She's a real tail wagger.
- [laughs]
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Oh, she's brought
her own pooper scooper.
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm loving my daytime
dog park realness look.
I'm Nicki Minaj meets Barbie.
- Well, poo-poo-pee-doo.
Phi Phi's the shit.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Sharon Needles.
Just another dog day afternoon.
- Is this another
Simpson sister?
- I'm serving true dog park
realness.
It's kind of inspired by
late '60s
Italian fashion photographs.
- She looks fetching.
That's right,
clean up after your dog.
Chad Michaels.
Uh-oh, she lost her doggie.
- I'm really loving my daytime
dog park realness.
It's light, it's flowy,
and I feel beautiful in it.
- I told you to keep your dog
on its leash.
Oh, you'll find it.
Category is: Pooch in a purse.
Party girl realness.
Latrice Royale.
Hey!
- Well...
- She is on the VIP list.
- Uh-huh.
- My party girl look is very
chic,
very "Let's go cha cha,
boo boo,
I'll meet you at the club."
- She's all up in the club.
The kennel club.
- [laughs]
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Oh!
Can I borrow that wig?
- That's her hair, Wynonna.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh, my goodness.
Look at those heels.
Her dogs must be barking.
- My "it" girl looks like
Rihanna
if Rihanna had a dog.
It's edgy.
- She carries her poochie
in her Gucci.
- Sharon Needles.
Oh...
- Rock and roll party girl.
- If Courtney and Lindsay
had a baby?
- Yes.
- What's she got
around her ankle?
Uh-oh.
- Oh, it's a scram bracelet.
- Yes, it is.
- I'm serving heroin chic,
hung-over, party girl realness.
Like the celebrities I see
in my tabloids.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- [laughs]
- Eat a sandwich.
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels.
- Posh party girl.
- Ready for the paparazzi.
- I am serving structured
Kardashian realness.
I'm feeling very confident,
I'm feeling a little
bitchy in it.
- She has a big diamond
from her rich man.
- Yes.
- And she's got a big behind
right now, too.
- Mm-hmm.
- Very Kardashian.
Category is...
canine couture eleganza.
Latrice Royale,
and her dog Babyface.
- It's very<i> Mahogany.</i>
- Yes.
Look at that furry muff.
- [laughs]
- I'm giving them sleek,
sophisticated, simple, clean
silhouette,
and I'm feeling good,
and looking gorgeous.
- She's dressed to the canines.
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and her dog Hunter.
Ladyboy and the tramp.
- Oh, look at Hunter's bow tie.
- I'm a hound dog.
- I'm just trying to serve
the judges glamorous fish,
and they couldn't take
their eyes off me.
- Oh, yeah.
- You know what he smells.
- What does he smell?
- Pussy willows?
- Oh, of course.
- [laughs]
- Sharon Needles,
and her dog Cali.
- Cali caliente.
- That bitch is in heat.
Her poodle's on fire!
- It looks like
I'm walking three Calis.
I kept all the fur on the lower
half of me,
and her height
matched up perfectly
to my canine couture boots.
- Do the boots match the dog,
or does the dog match the boots?
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels,
and her dog London Paris Filan.
- [laughs]
- Every dog has
its De La Renta.
- My canine couture
is just a slight nod
to Cruella Deville
on vacation in Aspen.
- It's a little<i> 101 Dalmatians.</i>
- Cruella.
- Yes, very Cruella.
- Kinkyella.
See you on the slopes.
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's go straight to
the judges' critiques.
First up, Latrice Royale.
- I'm loving the whole
<i>Mahogany</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>
- Thank you.
- I just think you've got a lot
of sass and a lot of class.
- And a lot of ass.
- Pow!
- [laughs]
- Eat it.
- Some men like a little meat
with their potatoes.
- [laughs]
- Out of all three looks,
I think the daytime was your
least successful.
Glitter navy skirt going
to the dog park--a little much.
- Your canine couture, simple.
I would've liked
a little bit more.
- Thank you, Latrice.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Because I worked with my
prissy-butt mom for ten years,
I'm always looking
for the head-to-toe.
I think makeup-wise, flawless.
Your sparkles are aplenty.
Your boots, oh, my gosh.
- The dogs production,
you stole the show.
You were fully into, like,
the cute little ditzy dog role.
Your Japanime, over-the-top
daytime realness
was not realness.
- I have no interest in real.
- [laughing]
- I find real people boring.
I'd be far happier to see you
at my dog park any day
than to see somebody in
sweatpants and tennis shoes.
- She would hate us
at the dog park, Wy.
- I don't go to the dog park.
I have people
that do that for me.
[laughter]
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- The only thing I would say
is in the opening,
the lip sync was a bit off.
- Ooh, okay.
- Your canine couture really
shocked me when you came out.
It doesn't have to be so...
old lady.
- There's something about
that look that just...
is less diva-ish.
- Thank you, Chad.
Next up, Sharon Needles.
- Love this look tonight.
You look like you
came out of an editorial
out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
- [gasps] Ooh!
- I'm sure you
made those boots.
- 5-1/2 hours
and a hot glue gun.
- If somehow Liza Minnelli
in<i> Cabaret</i>
and Jean Harlow had a baby,
and threw it
in white puffy boots
with the perfect poodle,
it would be you.
That poodle could not have
worked the boots harder
with you.
- And it was good to see you
as a blonde-blonde,
not like an evil zombie blonde.
It was nice to see that
different side of you.
You continue to inspire.
- Ah!
- Thank you, Sharon.
Ladies, one final question.
Which of these bitches
does not deserve
to be in the top three?
Let's start with Sharon Needles.
[dramatic music]
- I'm going to say
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She has a very cutthroat
attitude.
To be America's
next drag superstar,
we need a sweetheart.
As drag queens, I think
we need to show as much heart
and family morals
amongst sisters--
- Bullshit.
What you said right now
is a complete lie.
I value family morals.
You're on stage lying,
is what you're doing.
- I'm not lying.
- But you are.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
same question.
- I would definitely
have to say Sharon.
For him to stand on this stage
and tell...
that I don't value family
is bullshit.
If I'm, you know, cutthroat,
then so be it.
I'm a fierce competitor,
and I deserve to be here.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
- Chad Michaels, same question.
- I would say Phi Phi.
She has...a lot maturing to do.
At times, she has acted her age,
and she's made no qualms about
wanting to win this contest,
hands down, whatever it is
that she needs to do.
- Latrice Royale.
- [exhales]
- I feel Sharon Needles.
She has gotten through this
competition being imperfect.
On the runway,
we strive for perfection.
If I was to come out here
with unfinished seams
and a ripped up this
and a ripped up that,
my ass would be handed to me.
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
All right,
just between us girls,
let's start with Latrice Royale.
- Party girl was her best.
That was cute-ish.
But it wasn't enough
compared to the other divas.
She was just too flat
for me tonight.
- When she picked Sharon Needles
and was critiquing her
for her unfinished hemlines,
and then I looked down
and Latrice has, like,
something that is clearly
an unfinished hemline,
it was little like
kettle, pot, black.
- Right.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I was counting Phi Phi out
for a few weeks in a row,
and she's really
done the Phoenix
and risen from the ashes.
- Yeah.
- I was very impressed
in all facets
of her performance tonight.
- What did you think of what
Sharon had to say about her...
ambition in the competition.
- Even if someone
is extremely ambitious,
I don't hold that as a fault.
- The blessing is she's,
you know, fierce.
The burden is she's fierce.
- I totally understand
that burden.
- [laughs]
Me too, Rose.
- Little miss attitude
down there.
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels.
- She's so elegant, and she
really has the "it" factor.
- She's got the beauty and this
classy look to her
that the clothes
did not live up to.
- Tonight was the first night
that I was like "meh" with Chad.
- Sharon Needles.
- She really turned it out.
She really gave us ball
day realness, like, down.
Boots!
Party girl chic
was the winner for me.
- She looked like an Olsen twin.
- [laughs]
The canine couture,
the boots that she hot-glued
together,
I want to eat that shit up.
- She owned it.
It's very, very hard
for me right now
to go between Phi Phi
and her for the night.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Now bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your performance
in the Bitch Ball,
I've made some decisions.
[dog whining]
Sharon Needles,
you are a lone wolf
who barks to the beat
of a different drummer.
And tonight, you are top dog.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
[dog barks]
You've won crystal flower
body jewelry
made by Marianna Harutunian.
- Thank you so much.
[dog barks]
Winning this challenge
means so much to me,
'cause I just never thought
I would be in the top three,
and it's awesome.
- Chad Michaels...
- Yes, Ru.
- Throughout this competition,
you have been
a leader of the pack.
But tonight, you didn't leave us
begging for more.
[dog whimpers]
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- It's tough to hear
those infamous words,
but I'm ready to fight for my
place in this competition.
- [exhales]
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you started
out as the runt of this litter,
but tonight, you've proven that
you can teach a young dog
new tricks.
Phi Phi O'Hara...
you are safe.
[dog howls]
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale...
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
[dog whimpering]
- Child, honey.
Let's shine on, boo boo.
Let's shine.
Let's shine on.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance
of<i> No One Else On Earth</i>
by Wynonna.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip sync
for your life.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[No One Else On Earth</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
- I've never done
a country song ever,
and my plan is to just attack it
Latrice Royale style.
- I don't want to go home,
not after coming this far,
so I'm gonna turn it out.
- Latrice always gives that
great soul energy.
Unfortunately, I just don't
think that synced up
with this song.
- [laughing]
- Oh...my...God.
[applause]
- Work, bitches!
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Chad Michaels...
shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Ru.
Thank you, judges.
- Latrice Royale...my queen.
I bow to you.
And I have one thing to say:
Bitches better beware.
- You have changed my life
forever.
You have changed the world
of drag forever.
I love you and respect you
so much.
And thank you for seeing
something special in me.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Now...
sashay away.
- [sobbing]
She is large, in charge,
chunky, yet funky,
the bold and beautiful,
I am Latrice Royale.
[dog barks, whines]
- Dream and dream big.
It doesn't matter
where you come from,
what color you are,
what shape you are.
Be the best you can be.
- My top three,
the best of the best.
And there's only one way
to go from here,
and that's up.
So remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I an amen up in here.
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
the theme for this year's Pride
is hope floats.
[cheers and applause]
- Jiggly is a hot mess.
- Where the fuck are my
tits?
- Ahoy.
Orange Jigglius.
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?
- I'm giving you maritime
realness with the starship
Willam.
- Milan.
- Her body language is totally
"dude in a dress."
- Willam, condragulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
- Jiggly Caliente...
shantay, you stay.
Milan, sashay away.
And tonight...
get out your library cards,
girls.
The library is open.
- You're such a fat slut,
after sex you smoke hams.
[laughter]
- And the dolls go glossy.
- You have to spot me.
- With extra special guest
judges Regina King
and Pam Tillis.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX Cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy of
alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut Vodka...
cocktails perfected...
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
[tires screeching]
- Cluck, cluck, ladies.
- Where's our hangers?
- Wha-wha!
- Milan's gone, and now it's
down to the lucky seven.
- "Colored girl, why yo base
look like chalk?"
- I loved Milan, you guys.
Milan was a class act.
How did it feel to lip sync
against your mama?
Were you scared?
- No, 'cause I know Milan is
good, but then I know I'm good
too.
- Well...
- Do you think you're gonna
win the show?
- At least--
- That was an awkwardly long
pause.
- Yeah.
- I was at the bottom two
twice, so the girls are just
kinda, like, assuming that
I ain't shit.
- You went from a baked potato
to a sweet potato.
- Sweet potatoes have
antioxidants.
- But they're better.
- It's a good fat,
as they say.
- Dumbass bitches, I'm gonna
fight till the end.
I just wanna see her do what I
did with our without shoes.
- You wanna see me do a split?
- Go ahead, jump into a split.
- I can't jump into a split.
- Thank you, then shut the
fuck up, bitch.
- Bye, Milan.
We'll see you in New York City.
She as really defensive,
though, a lot.
- It's hard to come here and,
like,
people tell you
that you're not good
at what you've been doing.
- Oh, trust me, I get it.
I think the trick with dealing
with the judging panel
is just get them to tell you
that they have no notes
and that you're perfect.
[laughs]
Yeah, I won.
I was stunned.
I'm like,
"This is the best review
I've ever gotten in my life.
- You had your moment,
and you done had your shine.
Now, can we let it go, girl?
Because, boo-boo,
it's a new week
and a new challenge.
And you're in one week,
and you can slip the next.
No tea, no shade.
- I was fucking stunned
that they said that.
- Well, they upped
the smoke machine last night,
so they couldn't see your beard
coming through.
[laughter]
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Extra, extra!
Tweet all about it!
Like a rolling stone, today's
queen on the down low needs to
be a real hustler on time and
always in style.
So start spreading the news,
'cause you're gonna wake up in
a cyber city that never sleeps.
Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Good morning.
- My legendary children.
In the great tradition of
<i>Paris is Burning...</i>
[deep voice] Get out your
library cards, girls.
- Ooh!
- Yes!
- Because reading is what?
all: Fundamental!
- Oh, God.
- Now for today's mini
challenge, you'll take turns
throwing shade.
Hashtag "thelibraryisopen."
21st-century reading, darlings.
All right, ladies, first up
Dida Ritz.
- I'm gonna try.
I don't know how to really read
that well, so...
does someone smell that?
- What? What is it?
- Oh, that's just
Sharon Needles.
- Oh!
- Jiggly Caliente, you should
feel honored.
The first contestant in
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history</i>
with child.
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- Latrice Royale,
you're free now.
You don't have to rock the yard
sandals anymore.
[laughter]
- Jiggly Caliente.
Darling, what do you see?
- Bitches.
- Oh-oh.
- Dida, let me start with you,
boo.
- There's lotion in my purse.
You need to use them on your
elbows and your knees.
You look like you've been
driving through flour, baby.
- Oh!
Phi Phi O'Hara,
India called.
She wants her look back,
boo.
- [chuckles]
- Mama Chad, it's called
Forever 21, not Forever 41.
- [laughs]
- Willam, honey, your face
is made out of marble.
Shit don't move.
- Oh-oh.
Dida, you know,
I always think it's cute
to rock your mother's
two-piece sweater set
on the runway.
Oh-oh.
- Oh, jujubee, you know,
helium's for balloons,
not your stomach.
Oh, and, you know, Willam,
I know you're talented at,
you know, buying shoes,
but are you talented at,
you know, drag?
You know, uh, Sharon, I love how
you rock the party city.
- That's where I got your
Lady Gaga wig.
[laughter]
Phi Phi sucked.
- Dida Ritz, I don't know if
that is hot couture or hot
"coutorn," 'cause there's holes
in that shirt.
There are holes in the garment.
Ooh, Jiggly.
Jiggly, uh, 31--yeah,
there should be 32.
- Ooh.
Phi Phi, you are gorgeous.
You catch the camera's eye
from the right.
But from the left, you snag it.
- Ohh!
Crawlin' out the tar pits with
your relative the saber-tooth.
Visit it while you're in
Los Angeles.
- [laughs]
- Chad Michaels, you so old,
you still on
myspace.Com/chadmichaels.
- I was gonna take that down.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the RuPaul ball.
Tonight in the category
of butch queen, Dida Ritz.
- Oh!
- Jiggly, I love you.
Come to mother dust.
Come here, come to me.
Come to me, I won't hurt you.
Here's my dentist's card.
Use it.
Willam Belli.
Willam Belli loves to live his
life and think that he's
Carrie Bradshaw.
But in the sequel, she'll be
playing Scary Bradshaw.
- Oh-oh.
- Latrice.
Latrice's feet are so big,
she will be starring
in the remake
of the beloved family favorite
<i>Flipper.</i>
[laughter]
- Jiggly Caliente, B.M.W.
Body Made Wrong.
[laughter]
Phi Phi O'Hara, although reading
is fundamental, darling, you
might learn how to spell first,
you illiterate fuck.
[laughter]
Willam, Miss Industry,
congratulations on your new role
as the big bad wolf by the hair
on your chinny, chin, chin.
- Yeah!
- Yes!
- Sharon Needles, two words...
sideshow freak.
[laughter]
- Dida Ritz, a lot of you girls
like to clock me for painting
my skin on the gray side, but
I was inspired by your knees.
- Oh!
- They're the same color
as Willam's chin.
- Oh-oh-oh!
- Phi Phi O'Hara, what brand
of makeup do you wear?
Sherman Williams?
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- That was a weak one.
Latrice Royale, you know,
a lot of us have done
great work in bars.
You've done your best
behind them.
[laughter]
Jiggly Caliente, you're such
a fat slut,
after sex you smoke hams.
[laughter]
- [deep voice] The library is
permanently shut down.
Ooh, no tea, no shade.
And the winner is...
Latrice Royale.
[cheering]
- Yes.
- Condragulations, darling.
- Thank you, Mama.
- My girls.
For this week's main challenge,
I need you to conquer the world
of publishing.
You'll be launching your very
own dragazine.
Oh, pit crew!
As editor-in-chief, you'll each
be assigned a different title.
And then it's up to you to
create a cover, choose the
articles, and really make it
your own.
Now, Latrice, since you won
the mini challenge, you get to
assign the dragazines.
- Oh.
- She's picking<i> </i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge,</i>
health and fitness.
Jiggly Caliente.
Wow.
-<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
For food lovers.
Dida Ritz.
Uh-oh,<i> Sugar Walls.</i>
Now, this is home decor.
Willam, editor-in-chief.
<i>Kitty Cats.</i>
Meow! For cat lovers.
Meow!
<i>Kitty Cats!</i>
[laughter]
- I love pussy.
- Yes, who doesn't?
<i>Sashay Away.</i>
Travel.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Are you trying to say
something?
- Please do.
[laughter]
- And last but not least,
for fashion,<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> goes to...</i>
Chad Michaels,
which leaves<i> What's the T?</i>
Celebrity gossip
for Latrice Royale.
All right, ladies, you are on
a tight deadline,
so get to work.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- I think what makes this
challenge so hard is we've not
had to do anything like this.
It kinds separates the
intellectual people from
the not-so-intellectual people.
- Jiggly does go right for that
snack bin, honey.
It helps her think, I think.
Crunch, crunch.
"Oh, yeah, I got an idea."
Crunch, crunch.
Health and fitness.
Ha!
- Jiggly.
- [belches]
- Any complaints?
- What the fuck do I know
about working out?
- I know, right!
- Shit.
- See, I'm helping you out,
girl.
- Did they say we have to make
these comedy?
- Never hurts.
- You gotta grab your
attention--do like
the headlines that are on your
back to front cover.
- The thing is, like, me and
comedy obviously doesn't mix.
I think I'm just gonna be real
about it.
- I do not suggest you do this
for real.
I'm sorry.
I think you should make it
funny.
Everybody likes to laugh.
That's my advice to you.
- My only advice with that is
that if you feel like you can
get more with the serious route,
I'd rather you have a consistent
magazine that you can follow
by.
- Phi Phi...shady.
- 'Cause if you fuck up funny,
then it's gonna fuck up bad.
- Exactly.
For me, it's hard to find
the funny in weight loss.
Hell, no, no.
I'm gonna be serious, and I'm
gonna do this the right way
emotionally.
- He's doing a serious one
for his.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- No.
- His humor is, like,
his strongest thing.
- I know that he's gonna mess
up if he does, like, serious.
So I was like, "No,
you should do serious."
I'm tired of Jiggly.
She doesn't belong here.
Send her ass home.
Did you wanna help pack his
bags?
[laughs maniacally]
Ahh, you stupid bitch.
- Today we get to be
editors-in-chief
of our own dragazine.
- I have<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
- We have to design a cover,
pose for it,
and come up with
eye-catching headlines.
"How to stop over-salting
your food,"
'cause I always hear people
talk about that.
Like, people always salt
their food too much, you know.
I really want to, like, almost
class this up a little bit.
It can easily come off as
offensive.
You know, a black woman on
the cover of a magazine saying--
with a title like that.
- [laughs]
Girl, go on.
- It's like, I don't even like
to really eat chicken in public.
- Girl, really?
- I don't eat watermelon in
public, because people are
ignorant and people make
comments.
- I know, girl, but--
- It's disrespectful and rude.
- 5 Gs, please.
Good God, get a grip, girl.
'Cause it's not that serious.
Really, you're a dude in a wig.
[laughs]
- Latrice, she set you up.
- She set me up.
Latrice was trying
to gook a bitch.
- [laughs]
- Can I please win a challenge?
Hopefully, I could exchange my
mini challenges for a win.
- You should step up your game,
girl.
Win a big one.
- So far in this competition,
I haven't won a main challenge.
Doing graphic and web design,
this is what I do
in my day job,
so if I lose this challenge,
it's gonna make me upset.
Honestly,
I don't want<i> Sugar Walls.</i>
- This is the one I wanted.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm glad for you,
but I did not want that.
You're a sarcastic little bitch,
so you'll come up
with something.
- Where there's a Willam,
there's a way.
The only problem I'm having
in the workroom today is,
I just want to tell
the others girls,
"You can stop.
I'm gonna win."
- Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Hi, Ru.
Hi.
- How are my future media
moguls doing?
- Fabulous.
- Well, well,
busy at work here.
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
How are you gonna convey Dida
in "Chicken of the Month?
- Well, "Chicken of the Month,"
I mean,
there's so many different ways
you can cook chicken.
- Seriously?
I would've took that whole
chicken thing into
a whole
different direction.
- You can broil it,
you can fry it.
- But how will we know this
is Dida?
- It's me.
Who else would think of
"Chicken of the month"?
I haven't heard Oprah come up
with it yet.
I mean,
you're fascinated by that.
You want to pick up the magazine
and look at it.
- Well...
- "Chicken of the Month" for me.
- Uh-huh, okay.
- I believe in my idea, and if
it makes me have to lip sync
for my life, then so be it.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
<i>Sashay Away.</i>
So tell me about the cover.
- Well, I'm channeling
the horny gay, like 69 hot spots
for hookups.
- You know, the challenge is
to combine travel and Phi Phi
O'Hara's esthetic.
How are you gonna do that?
- Well, Phi Phi's sexy.
I'm just gonna, you know,
showcase my sexiness.
- This reminds me of when you
told me you were going to make
Lady Gaga really pop.
Do you remember that
conversation?
- She popped;
it might not have been in a
good way,
but she popped.
- All right, get to work.
- All righty, thanks, Ru.
- Sharon Needles.
- Hi.
-<i> Kitty Cat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
Who is this magazine for?
- Well, you know,
I see the cat magazines
at the pet store,
and they're always geared to,
like, grandmas and, like,
sad ladies that never
fell in love and stuff.
So this is more for, like,
Edie Beale,
that, you know, have cats,
because they're cheaper
than boyfriends.
- So, now, what does<i> </i>
<i>Kitty Cats</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine say</i>
about Sharon Needles?
- [meows]
- Now, listen.
I want you to make
your dragazine appeal to me.
Even though I don't have a cat.
I want you to make me want
to get a cat.
- Okay.
- And just knock 'em dead,
kiddo.
- I will.
Thanks a lot.
- Willam.
- Hi.
- Editrix-in-chief of
<i>Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
- I prefer editor-in-queef.
- [laughs]
So now who would you say is your
target audience for<i> Sugar Walls?</i>
- Um...
women.
Men.
- All of the above.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a little broad to just
do men and women.
And, you know, there is
a certain esthetic that you have
that's very clear-cut.
That's what we wanna see in this
magazine.
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.
Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, Mama.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Oh, Mama,
you can call me Jiggly anytime.
- Oh.<i> Battle of the Bulge.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.
- Were you insulted by being
assigned that magazine?
- Yes, I've done some bad
things to lose weight.
- Well, what kind of things
have you done?
- I decided to binge and eat
a lot and throw it all up.
And I would say that it's not
the smartest thing to do.
And I just think that when it
comes to weight loss, it's not
a joking matter.
- You've been able to process
what people think of you through
your humor.
I mean, you're Jiggly Caliente.
That's your name.
Embrace the Jiggly.
- I am, I'm--
- Do you hear what I'm saying
to you?
- Yeah.
- You're funny.
Do that.
It's not rocket science.
- I'm going to stick to my guns,
because this,
I'm not questioning this.
This is the right way for me.
- Okay, all right.
Well, you got your work cut out
for you, Jiggly.
- Yes, I do.
- Think about it.
Chad Michaels.
- RuPaul.
- Editor-in-chief
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dragazine.</i>
- Finally.
- [laughs]
- I've been waiting.
<i>Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine is going</i>
to be geared toward drags
and the women who love drags.
Sort of the major is gonna be,
"Dusted or Busted?
The Fashion and Runway Trashin'
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Season 4.</i>
- Oh, so this is an inside look
at some of the fashion
we've seen so far
in this season.
- And the inside scoop.
- I want to know that.
- It's gonna be fantastic.
- I can't wait to see
what the<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman</i>
is wearing next season.
[roaring]
- I'd like to show you.
Drag cougar, honey.
- [laughs]
Them old girls still have it.
- Yes. All right, kiddo.
See you later.
- Thanks, Ru.
Thank you.
Well, Latrice Royale.
Girl,<i> What's the T?</i>
- What's the T, Ru?
- How are you gonna make your
dragazine something that is
relevant in the 21st century?
- You're gonna wanna buy it
once you see me on the cover
because everyone knows that
Latrice is the true "T".
- Well, the publications at
the grocery have stars on
the cover, and they have star
names in their articles.
- Oh.
So I'm gonna go back to my
research department.
- Yes.
- I'll get it there.
- You get to it.
- Thank you.
- All right, dolls,
gather round.
Tomorrow night is the launch
of your dragazines.
We'll be joined by our extra
special guest judges.
platinum-selling country artist
Pam Tillis will be here.
- Yee-haw!
- Pam Tillis, old-school
country diva, honey.
- And an actress I've loved
since she was a child on<i> 227.</i>
The star TV's<i> Southland,</i>
Regina King will be here.
[cheering]
- I love Regina King.
She's on a show called<i> </i>
<i>Southland.</i>
Oh, wait, I was on a show called
<i>Southland.</i>
- Oh, and one last thing.
Don't fuck it up.
All right, bye.
- Bye, Ru.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi.
Ooh, hi. How are you?
- Good,
I'm Jonathan Clay Harris.
So what are we doing today?
- Our challenge this week is,
we have to develop our own
dragazine.
So now we're gonna pose for our
fabulous cover.
My magazine
is<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
I want it to be a sexy magazine
but with chicken.
- Yeah, give me some sexy.
Sex appeal with that one.
Oh, my God, chicken?
Chicken?
- Chicken.
- Yeah, work that chicken.
Show me a little hunger
in those eyes.
- What drag queen do you know
that has taken a head shot
with chicken?
Chicken!
- And what are you serving
for dinner tonight?
- Look at you.
You look gorgeous.
- Yeah, you too.
- Oh, thank you.
- Have you done porn?
- Not recently.
- Well, you should really
consider it.
Thought it would be a genius
idea mounting the cat climber,
channeling my inner kitty cat.
- Just be careful.
- I can trust myself.
- All right, Sharon, I don't
think this is working.
Let's go back.
- God, you don't know anything
about fashion.
Okay, we're gonna just do
chairs.
- There you go.
- Work that hand...
<i>Eleganza.</i>
- I wanted to seem like
a powerful bitchy mogul woman.
- Let's get a little more of
that pussy in there.
There you are.
Beautiful, right there.
- I was totally giving
the camera nothing but legs,
and I was giving them pure
cunt face.
- Beautiful.
- I feel sexy in anything,
even a body bag.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Oh, wow.
- So what's your magazine cover
that you're doing today?
- I'm doing, uh...
what was it?
Bulge of--<i> </i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
-<i> Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> okay.</i>
Are those RuPaul's
Iron Fist shoes?
- Yeah, these are RuPaul
Iron Fist shoes.
- Those are amazing.
- Aren't they sickening?
- They're sickening.
- This is the most exercise I'm
gonna get for the rest
of my life.
- Oh, no.
Here we go.
Little<i> Kill Bill</i><span style="bodyStyle"> action.</i>
Here we go.
- God, if Phi Phi was just in
front of me, I could've knocked
her ass out for all that shit
she be running her mouth with.
Please don't trip me.
- We won't.
- One, two, three.
- Okay, once more, here we go.
[laughs]
- Doesn't matter, as long as
it looks like
it's in the air.
- Let's do it again.
Loosen a little bit.
Just mind your face
when you're jumping.
- Okay, I'm cool.
One, two...
- I just didn't think that
it kind of worked with Jiggly.
She just seemed so completely
uncomfortable with the camera.
- And you have to spot me.
- Point your eyes at me just
for a couple frames.
Gorgeous.
Look at those eyes.
- So my final wardrobe for
the photograph is really kind
of a '40s glam red carpet dress.
I could see someone like
Veronica Lake wearing it to
a movie premiere.
- And what do the goggles say
about your outfit?
- The goggles say,
"she's an adventurer and she's
fashion-forward."
- She looks like it.
- Right now it is important for
me to get out there and give
the judges some variety to be
a little bit less polished,
to be avant-garde.
I think I'm good.
I think we got it.
- I wanna look like--like--
like a hot Miami piece of ass.
Like you wanna visit me.
- Work, here we go.
You look like it to me.
- Good.
- Let's do it.
Miami, honey.
I wanna go for a more sexier
side of Phi Phi, something that
I haven't showed yet, and, you
know, I wanna be, like, a whore
on this magazine and have whore
headlines.
- Let's see some sex
in those eyes.
Here we go.
- I'm throwing you, like,
a Farrah Fawcett sexy look,
and, you know, I had the drink
in my hand.
I'm holding the umbrella.
Hold on, I don't want
my muscles showing.
I gotta look like a woman.
- You wanna look at 'em?
- Yeah, I feel sexy already.
So let's look at 'em.
I'm prettier than the other
girls, aren't I?
You can say it.
- I'm not going to.
- You should.
Delete that one.
That looks like a man.
I look like Sharon in that one.
- Okay.
[laughter]
Ouch.
- Yes, Mama, right there.
Good.
Beautiful.
Boys, I want you touching her.
- So<i> What's the T?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is a gossip</i>
column magazine.
Of course I'm featured on the
cover with my boys.
The boys.
Always helps when you have boys.
Come and join me on the couch.
Let's have a ménage à trois.
The boys, of course, is just for
my sheer amusement and pleasure.
Come do something.
Come rub on me.
Let me rub on you.
- Latrice, look at me.
Eyes at me, everyone.
Eyes at me.
Sex in the face.
Look at me.
- I love my boys,
and that's the "T".
- Sex sells, people.
Sex sells.
My overall concept is
stripped-down design.
Mama needs some tape.
Your head is so unprofessional.
- [chuckling]
- I tried to dress the pit crew
as lamps and put lamp shades on
their head, but their heads
aren't even.
And they wouldn't let me put
nails in them.
And remember to flex, boys.
I don't want you looking puny.
[laughter]
No faces, you don't exist.
- Willam was beautiful and
definitely knew her body.
- [laughing]
- I thought she was a little
bitchy.
You guys look amazing.
- Please don't address them.
- Right.
- You can't fuck me.
[laughs]
I'm gonna fall.
- Good.
Let's take a look at these.
- I'm naked, I'm tan,
and I have boys around me.
I'm happy with the photo shoot.
All right, now clean this
shit up.
[upbeat music]
[indistinct chatter]
- Good morning,
mother cluckers.
- We're back.
- We're back!
- We're back in the workroom
today,
and we're getting ready
to present our magazines on
the runway in our glossy glamour
looks.
- How did your challenge go
for you guys?
- Mine went well.
- I liked mine.
- Well, you have a health and
fitness magazine.
Why would you go serious
on that?
Obviously you were assigned
that magazine to, you know,
ham it up.
[laughter]
- There's more to me than just
being funny and goofy.
1240 on the SATs.
I need to show that I have
intelligence.
Girl.
- Latrice, does your family
still live--where are you from
again?
- Atlanta.
- Have you ever been, like,
bullied or whatever by family?
- From my brother, yeah.
He didn't want no punk for
a brother.
- My dad did that in front of,
like,
his fucking drinking
buddies.
I grew up in a house where
I was beat and made fun of for
being gay.
It was hell.
Family's supposed to love you
no matter what.
And if that's love,
I don't want it.
- You couldn't hold hands,
kiss, look at each other in
Texas without getting called
a faggot or anything.
- What kills me is that they
wanna say that we're the ones
destroying the institution
of marriage.
Please.
- You know, I've met gay people,
though,
that don't agree with
gay marriage.
- I--okay, here we go.
Since y'all brought it up.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- I just don't want it to be
called marriage.
For me, marriage describes
a straight relationship.
And I think we should be called
something else.
Call it something more fabulous.
- As a gay man, it's just hard
for me to believe that you don't
want equal rights for yourself.
- I did not say that.
- But if it's all the same
thing as marriage,
why not call it that?
- Because it's not the same
thing to me.
- Yes, it is.
- I will be pissed if Latrice
is gonna be the first one that
gets married too, bitch.
- Hell to the no.
- I fully support gay divorce.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, you old tool.
- What you talking 'bout, tool?
- On newsstands everywhere,
it's Santino Rice.
- Lookin' beautiful
as a fresh bruise.
Black and blue.
- Grammy award-winner
Pam Tillis.
I am so excited you're here.
- You are like a song.
I'm telling you.
[trills tongue]
- [laughs]
And Regina King.
Hey, girl, you look like
a cover girl.
- Oh, thank you.
So do you.
You have to show me how you
create the hair blowing without
the fan look.
- [laughs]
This week, our queens went to
the presses to launch a new
dragazine, and now they're ready
to pump up your circulation.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Sharon Needles in
black and white, editorial.
- She's black and white and
fierce all over.
- This is a glamorous look for
Sharon Needles.
- It is.
- I'm feeling like
the Tim Burton
vintage sci-fi glamazon.
I feel stunning.
- Her booty looks awesome
in that dress.
- Yes, thanks, DuPont.
Very<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>
- I was thinking
Jackie Collins.
- Kind of like a possessed
Jackie Collins.
- Yes, yes.
Up next, Dida Ritz.
- Not just a cracker.
- No.
- What'd you call me?
- I love the little "S" walk.
- Yes, it's a strategic walk
so a sniper can't get her.
[laughter]
- I'm serving you
editor-in-chief realness.
Old Hollywood glamour.
I feel sexy.
- Tastes like chicken.
Looks like fish.
- Uh-uh.
- Chad Michaels.
Rock and roll.
- Lita Ford.
- Pat Benatar.
- Tonight I'm wearing something
more dangerous.
My paint is much darker
than usual.
I'm loving my short hair.
I'm feeling fantastic.
-<i> Guns &amp; Ammo</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
Cover of<i> Rolling Stone.</i>
- Where is her Stratocaster?
- Yes.
- It's hidden.
- Latrice Royale.
<i>Ebony</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
- Foldout.
- Yes, honey, this is
a two-page spread.
- I walk out giving my Gothy
glam, very Nubian princess,
lots of jewels and cleavage,
and I feel gorgeous.
- She makes glamour look
real simple.
- I love the jewels down the
back.
- Yes, gorgeous.
- Like a character from<i> </i>
<i>The Wiz.</i>
- Uh-huh.
- Up next, Willam.
Red carpet ready.
- Kylie Minogue.
- Kylie min-yes.
- Just the whole body, jeez.
- Uh-huh.
- I feel confident
on the runway.
I'm just giving them cute girl,
fish salad realness with a side
of Teddy.
- Hollywood starlet.
- Back action and everything.
- I want a lifetime
subscription.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Venus de Brooklyn.
- Build me up, buttercup.
- Uh-huh.
- I want the judges to take it
all in, catch it.
Look at all the Swarovskis.
I want them to try to count how
many Swarovski there are on
this gown.
I look like a fucking
lemon drop.
A blinging lemon drop.
- That's a pretty dress.
- It is gorgeous.
I love me a train.
- Mm.
I'm gonna leave that alone.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Ooh.
- Wow.
Serving body and turquoise.
- I love the proportion.
- Yeah.
- Love all that leg.
Beautiful.
- Go on and take
the center stage.
- Walking down the runway,
I'm feeling super sexy and
flirty, and I'm just having
a good time out there.
It's a fishy outfit,
I look really pretty in it.
I look glamorous.
- This is the best Phi Phi
has ever looked.
Very<i> Cosmo</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girl.</i>
No Photoshop necessary.
Hello, dolls.
Let's find out whose dragazines
are fresh and fabulous, and
whose are just conde nasty.
Up first, Chad Michaels.
<i>Eleganza.</i>
- Yes.
- I wanted to take the theme
of<i> Eleganza,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> which was style,</i>
and gear it toward drag cougars
and the women who love them.
- I didn't know what type of
magazine it was.
It's just all over the place.
- It looks like something that
you would pick up for free at
the grocery store.
You look beautiful tonight.
Love the one-shoulder.
You look great in black.
- You guys challenged me to
dirty it up a little bit,
and I feel fantastic.
- I love that Chad thinks
this is dirty.
I guess it is for Chad.
- All right, up next,
Dida Ritz.
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
- Yeah, that's what they say.
- I wanted to add a little bit
of, you know, glamour to it,
and my inspiration was really
the type of women you see on
the Food Network.
- I saw "stop."
It kind of is at odds with your
fun look and your fun colors,
and then this negative message.
- I like black hair on you.
It looks very pretty.
Just next time think more
volume.
I keep telling you more volume.
It's all about the silhouette.
- All right, next up,
Sharon Needles.
<i>Kitty Cats.</i>
Meow.
- I wanted to create a hip cat
magazine for, like, young
hipsters that love cats.
- Oh, you nasty bitch.
You--oh, my God, I love
the headlines.
I just wanna read it.
I wanna know how many is too
many.
- Well, I'm talking about cats.
You're a pervert.
- Oh, I know, I know,
I know.
But the eyes scare me.
- They're my trademark.
- But everything else is just
so pretty and elegant.
It, like, creeps me out.
- I am still waiting to see
full-on glam, no eyes,
no Goth Sharon Needles.
Just once.
I don't think you'll lose you.
- Next up, Latrice Royale.
<i>What's the T?</i>
- If my magazine was on the
newsstand, if you're not picking
it up for me, you're definitely
gonna pick it up for the hot
boys that are lusting after me,
so...
- I sort of expected your
magazine to be like, "Shh!"
- It looks like the name of the
magazine is "Hollywood."
It looks more like a club flyer.
- You don't need the pit crew
boys on there at all.
It really looks like you got
some hookers somewhere.
- This gown that you came out
in, it's like, ugh,
that's so heavy.
It looks like a couch from
Rent-A-Center.
- I think there's a little too
much jewelry; I don't know.
- Oh, Lord, Jesus.
-<i> Showgirls.</i>
[laughter]
- Oh, oh.
- Oh.
My bracelet breaks.
Oh, fuck.
In front of everybody.
- But already that looks
better.
It does.
- Next up, Willam.
<i>Sugar Walls.</i>
- I love home design, and I
made one of the pillows
on the cover.
I'm a power bottom like that.
- I love what you look like
tonight, but in the beard area,
we see the shadow again tonight.
- Touch this.
Touch all of this.
- I'm trying to help because
you're the only one that has it.
So it really hits hard when it's
out there.
- Your dragazine cover is
possibly the worst one.
I hate the font.
- Me too.
- Okay.
- This looks like a porn thing
about to happen.
I'm getting anything but
decorating from this.
- Yeah, I wouldn't have hired
myself to be that designer.
I love the ideas that I had.
I wish I had more time to
execute them and a better staff.
- See, my career I've had to do
every single part of
show business.
You know, edit, produce,
you name it.
And that's what we're really
looking for.
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- No.
- [laughs]
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
- I found the funny, and I
found the silly humor in it.
<i>Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
ya, ya, ya!
- I think with<i> Battle of the</i>
<i>Bulge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> you could have really</i>
taken it anywhere.
- Yeah, because when we spoke
in the workroom, I was going on
and on about you should approach
it with more humor.
- I chose to play with words
instead of the humor because
I don't know anything about
fitness.
What the hell would I write
about, how to eat a pound
of chicken?
- Exactly, that's funny.
- Oh, damn.
[laughter]
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
You got<i> Sashay Away,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the travel dragazine.
Wow, va-va-voom.
- This is the best I've ever
seen you look so far.
- Yeah, all the proportions
are right.
Cute little outfit.
Your makeup looks lovely.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
[laughing]
- You look gorgeous on
the cover.
The color makes me wanna go
wherever you are.
This looks like an actual
magazine.
- You picked all the key words
to highlight.
Bathhouse, 69, virginity.
I would read this inside
and out.
- All right, ladies, while you
enjoy an Absolut cocktail in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
All right, just between us
girls, what do you think?
Chad Michaels.
- The runway really made up for
the look that's on the cover
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine,</i>
which is horrible.
- And it's just not modern
or hip.
- If you're looking for hip,
young, and trendy, you ain't
gonna find it in Chad Michaels.
- Dida Ritz.
- I'm just kind of thinking
she's somewhere in the middle
today.
She was cute on the cover.
- I never equate fabulous drag
queens and cute.
- Right.
- I wanna be devastated.
- She comes out like a straight
line with these big football
player shoulders with flat hair.
She's a pretty girl, but it
seems like we're getting stuck
here a little bit with Dida.
- All right, let's move on to
Sharon Needles.
- I really like her sense of
comedy.
There's something really cool
about her.
- Yeah, her dragazine,
very funny, tongue in cheek.
And it looks like it reeks of
cat piss in there.
- I did like her dragazine.
- Do I think it's the best?
No.
- Latrice Royale.
- The dragazine cover was like
Sydney Biddle Barrows, you know?
It was like a madam's calling
card.
- Willam and<i> Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dragazine.
- She totally missed the mark,
and I really feel like this was
probably one of the easiest
ones to do.
And there's something about her
on stage that's a bit robotic.
It's like she stood there with
the same exact smile.
It was kind of creepy.
I kept, like, looking over to
see, all right, okay, 20 minutes
has passed by, and she was
still...
- Yeah, that don't move.
- She's got a major attitude,
and I like that, though.
Good news, bad news.
Good news, she's a diva.
Bad news, she's a diva.
- Jiggly Caliente and
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
- You know, Jiggly seems to be
some sort of self-sabotage.
- Yes.
- Maybe she doesn't feel like
she deserves to be here.
- Right.
- And if you don't believe it,
nobody else will.
- Moving on to Phi Phi O'Hara
and<i> Sashay Away</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
This looked like the most
professional magazine of
the whole bunch.
- It did, but as we're going
through all of these I'm
wondering did it look like
the most professional because
everything else was so bad?
- [laughs]
- I had a problem with the fact
that she wore
a blonde cap with
blonde hair.
She looked like she had a dead
baby lamb on her head.
- And who wants that?
- Nobody.
- Sharon Needles.
- There'd be blood coming out.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your dragazines and
your presentations on the main
stage, I've made some decisions.
[suspenseful music]
Phi Phi O'Hara, your travel
dragazine was a real trip.
And we're excited that you keep
taking us to new places.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
[applause]
- Ah, thank God.
- You've won a cruise to
the Bahamas courtesy of
alandchuck.travel.
- Oh, man.
[laughs]
Oh, finally.
This is my first win, and I'm
really excited because it's nice
to know that my hard work has
paid off.
Those girls better watch out.
- Sharon Needles, you're safe.
Dida Ritz...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Chad Michaels.
- Yes, ma'am?
- This week the judges were not
gagging on your<i> Eleganza.</i>
You...
are safe.
- [exhales]
Thank you.
- Jiggly Caliente, once again
you left us hungry for more.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Again?
Seriously?
That's just straight-up jank.
- Latrice Royale...
you're safe.
Willam, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru tells me about being
in the bottom two,
I feel shaken,
and it's a little scary.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight you were asked
to prepare a lip sync
performance of<i> Mi Vida Loca</i>
by Pam Tillis.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync...for your life.
- I'm gonna fight till the end.
No way I'm gonna let this skinny
Botox bitch send my ass home.
- Good luck and don't fuck
it up.
- I mean, I hate to say it,
but I think Willam did good.
She looked very much a young
country pop star.
- God damn, you couldn't give
me a Lil' Kim song?
- I really, really wished
I had panties on.
But I didn't think I'd have
to lip sync.
- Jiggly is pretty much
standing in one spot.
Not good.
[applause]
- Bravo.
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Willam...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'll always try to do
my best.
If I fall short, I'm sorry.
- Jiggly Caliente,
may I call you Jiggly?
- Yes.
- Good, because after your time
here, you'll be on a first-name
basis with millions of fans.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you so much.
I love you.
Deuces.
- [laughs]
- I'm disappointed, but I know
my mom would be so proud of me.
I fucking fought my way.
And it just didn't happen.
But life goes on.
It's all good.
- My sensational six.
The race to become America's
next drag superstar is still
wide open.
Now remember, if you can't love
yourself how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.


-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
My top three,
the best of the best.
- Morning, bitches.
- Chad Michaels,
<i>Lady Chadderly.</i>
- You want some of this?
We got plenty for you too!
- She's serving
the deadliest catch.
- Snapper.
I love the peek-a-boos.
They're sayin' hi.
- We gotta get back to
the sprinkler.
We gotta get back to
the running man.
- Excuse my beauty.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chicken shit gigs.
- [laughing]
- I'm a fucking oscar-winner.
[cheers and applause]
- Sharon Needles.
- This is my kinda ghoul.
- I might not be
the biggest star here,
but I got
the biggest knockers, okay?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[laughter]
- Take me to your leader.
- Yes, just a little prick
in the mouth.
- Oh, you nasty bitch.
[laughter]
- I'm the fucking
future of drag!
Why?
Because I'm sickening, bitch!
[laughs]
I'm Sharon Needles,
sharing responsibility.
- Well, hello, hello.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
survivor of the Rupocalypse.
Va-va-voom.
Her legs are like
peanut butter--easy to spread.
- You're me.
- That's what I was channeling.
- I loved it.
- Now I'm gonna show you how to
really beat a mug, bitch!
- Well, poo-poo-pi-doo!
Phi Phi's the shit.
- [laughing]
- Have three words for you--
fab-u-lous.
- Thank you.
- And tonight, the winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race,
America's
next drag superstar, is...
- The winner of
RuPaul's Drag Race will receive
<i>a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Nyx cosmetics.</i>
<i>A one-of-a-kind trip, courtesy</i>
<i>of alandchuck.travel.</i>
<i>Headline logo's Drag Race tour</i>
<i>featuring Absolut vodka--</i>
<i>cocktails perfected.</i>
<i>A custom crown designed by </i>
<i>Marianna Harutunian.</i>
<i>And a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
- [monotone] I am one of three.
- [monotone]I am two of three.
- I am three of three.
all: Resistance is futile.
- This is the top three,
and I feel really, really good
that I'm finally here.
I'm so excited.
- We bow to you,
fierceness diva.
- You are our ebony goddess.
And we will see you again soon.
- Bye, sister.
Coming down the runway,
400 pounds.
Coming down the runway
in a velvet gown.
It don't matter.
- Our sister Latrice
had a lot of spirit.
And I'll miss her.
- Remember the first day here,
just walking in here
and not knowing anyone?
It's like the first day
in prison, you know?
- Like the first day of school.
- It has been kind of like a
long therapy session.
- Almost.
It's therapy, rehab,
prison, school.
- This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.
- Girl, we've done some shit.
- First we got chased
by zombies.
- Drag queen zombies.
- I was so scraped up
and bruised from all of that.
- Just battered.
- We've walked down that runway
pregnant, with a dog,
and in a boat.
- What about
the wet T-shirt contest?
- Oh, I hated it.
- My mother's gonna be
so proud of that one.
- This is actually
who I thought
would make the top three.
- Well, I'll be honest,
I'm shocked
that I'm in the top
three.
I can't even win a pageant
in a bar in Pittsburgh.
And here I am.
- So, you guys, the runway was
pretty rough last week.
- Which one of these bitches
does not deserve to be
in the top three?
- I would say Phi Phi.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Bullshit.
- Are you guys feeling okay
about everything, or...
- Oh, I still hate both
of y'all.
- I think there was
a misunderstanding.
- We basically can agree
to disagree.
When it boils down to it,
we like each other.
I like you, Phi Phi.
Now, go home.
[alarm whirring]
- Ooh...girl!
<i>You got shemail.</i>
My queens, the chosen three,
you have survived
the end of the world,
bitch fights,
pregnant daddies,
and boatloads
of proud seamen.
Damn!
But your biggest test
is yet to come.
Which one of my girls will take
a giant step
and join me
in my elite squadron
of fighting glamazons.
Today,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tomorrow, the world.
[cackling]
[laughter]
- Hello, hello, hello, ladies.
- Hey, Ru.
- [laughing] Wow.
My girls.
Now, your resilient charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
earned you your place
in the top three.
But now it's time for
the ultimate test.
For your final challenge...
you'll be starring with me
in my new music video,
the fashion adventure
extravaganza,
<i>Glamazon.</i>
[laughter and cheers]
- Ah, it's so exciting.
- You'll have to dance, act,
style, and lip-synch
for your life...
as you work with director
Mathu Anderssen
and choreographer Candis Cayne.
- All right!
- Awesome.
- Now, I said it before,
and I'll say it again.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Hello, girls.
Congratulations.
both: Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Candis Cayne.
She's a famous superstar,
and is a fantastic dancer.
- Do any of you guys have
any dance experience?
- I do.
- Um, a little.
- A little.
Okay.
Well, you know, this is your
final challenge.
So it is super important that
you guys bring it.
- Okay.
- The concept of my
choreography
is high fashion
dragzilla primal glamour.
You turn, two, three.
Four and five.
Six, and then you repeat that,
but going back.
One, two...Sharon,
you wanna go this way.
- Okay.
Yes, right.
- Six, seven, eight!
Okay, stop.
You're spinning twice.
- Okay.
- So you should only spin
once there.
- Got it. Sorry.
Can you tell I'm shaking?
- It's okay.
It's all right.
- So why don't we start
one by one.
We'll start with you, Phi Phi.
- Okay.
- One, two, three, and four.
Five, stop, hit, hit.
Phi Phi, she's great;
she has the steps,
but she's also
a little cha-cha.
Let's try you, Chad.
One, two, three, and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's a little too, uh, girly.
Let's try you.
- All right.
- It doesn't have to be pretty.
- Mm-hmm.
Thank God.
No.
[laughing] I'm teasing.
I'm joking, I'm joking.
One, two, three, and four.
Okay, let me just go over it
with you.
So just look at my feet.
I'm most worried about Sharon.
If you don't get the steps down,
you can't perform the video.
And then on this leg, you go,
step, step, step.
- Step, step...
Oh, goodness.
It's just so fast.
I am intimidated
that the other girls
are picking this up
a lot quicker than me.
This is just far too difficult.
- I just want you guys to do
the best you can do, okay?
- It's hard.
- Let's beat this face, ladies.
- Now it's time to
change into our
beautiful monster outfits
for the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
- And this really is gonna be
the coolest video.
- Our looks for the music video
are kind of a mixture between
1950s B-horror films
meets an issue of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
Work.
You know what those monster
costumes remind me of?
- What?
- GWAR.
- Uh-huh.
- What's GWAR?
- "What's GWAR?"
- Talk about edgy.
- GWAR is, like, some crazy
'80s, like,
pop punk metal band,
but they wear
all latex monster costumes.
- Oh, why would I know that,
though?
- Because it's drag.
- Yeah, well...
- Oh.
- Coming from "never seen
<i>Paris is Burning."</i>
- I fell asleep.
- Ah!
As drag queens, I think of
ourselves as funhouse mirrors.
We reflect pop culture
back to the world,
and I think to be America's
next drag superstar,
you have to be exactly that.
- Fell asleep during
<i>Paris is Burning.</i>
- I was tired.
Chad and Sharon, they're old.
Screw them.
Let them watch their TV.
I have better things to do,
like become America's
next drag superstar.
- Candis Cayne
was an amazing instructor.
- I love that dance.
I thought the dance was fun.
- I hate it.
I just don't dance like that.
It freaks me out.
- Yeah, 'cause, I mean,
at this point,
we have to be perfect.
At this point, I kind of hope
Sharon messes up.
I want to win this.
- See, that's the shot.
- It is time,
ladies and gentlemen.
We're gonna start serving
Godzilla realness.
- And cue.
- And cut.
Honey, help that girl.
Sharon needs to stay
on her line.
- Huh?
- You're drifting in to Chad.
Try your best to stay straight.
- If you drift out of it,
the shot's kind of fucked
for everyone.
- All right.
- One, two, three, four.
Five, stop, hit, hit.
- Pose.
- Was I a little better?
- It was only one "wah" as
opposed to two "wah."
- It's just one song, Sharon.
- It needs to be together.
- We cannot
drop the ball on this.
- Action.
- [sighs]
- We're jumping ship.
You're supposed to go
in the front,
she goes in the back,
I cut through the middle.
So it's that easy.
- I feel like I'm on
<i>Candid Camera,</i>
and I'm the butt of the joke.
- Let's get through
the fucking dance
in the half an hour that
we've got to do it in.
- [whispering] Jesus Christ.
Sharon needs to get this,
and she needs to get it now.
- Oh, fuck, fuck me.
- This is gonna be
a crap video.
- Hi, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Chad.
- After the choreography
debacle yesterday,
it's important for me to do well
in the rest of
the music video.
- What's on the mirror?
- It says, "Meet us
in the ladies' room."
- Who's "us"?
- Could it be, like, some of
the departed girls?
- [feigns sobbing]
- What do you think it is?
- I don't even know.
- Let's go.
- Let's go check it out.
Oh, god.
- [chuckling]
- [gasps]
both: Surprise!
[laughter]
- It's Tyra and Raja,
winners of season two
and three.
- Hi, mama.
- Hi, baby.
I'm gonna cry.
Hold on.
- Raja and I,
we've worked together
for ten-plus years.
And I just have
a lot of love for Raja.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- We've got one more little
twist to share with you.
- You'll be acting with
Miss RuPaul herself.
- Cool.
- In a face-slapping,
gut-punching, kick-ass scene.
- Work.
- Oh...and you'll be having
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.
So a little piece of
sisterly advice.
both: Don't fuck it up.
- Oh, I'm starving, Ru.
- Oh, good.
- How are you?
- I'm terrific.
- You look so beautiful.
- Now you get to see me
up close and personal.
- [laughs]
And, by the way,
if you're hungry,
just have a bite.
- Well, actually, I haven't
eaten since 1972, Ru.
That's how I stay thin.
- Oh, good for you.
- Isn't that great?
- I want to ask you,
over the course of your time
here,
people, Michelle,
talked about, um,
you being so perfect.
- Right.
- Because you're very poised,
and you say
all the right things.
And I think she just
wanted to see
that vulnerable edge
that every superstar has.
- I'm me all the time.
And if it's not edgy enough,
then so be it.
- Now, are your parents
still with us?
- Yes, my parents are with us.
I actually live with my mom.
My father is nearby,
but, um, still a little bit
estranged.
- Why is that?
- It's been a long 25 years of,
um, me not forgiving.
I felt like my father really
chose another family over--
over me and my mom.
And it's just recently that...
I'm realizing how much it
affected me.
- How does it manifest?
- Sometimes, it's easy for me
to disconnect from things.
And not...
really face my own feelings
about my father.
- Is it possible that
the invulnerability
that Michelle
is talking about
is exactly what
you're describing?
- Could be.
- I bet that's what it is.
I'm just wondering if that is
your breakthrough moment
in terms of
not only this contest,
but, you know, in your life.
- It could very well be.
- Thank you so much, Chad.
- Thank you, Ru,
it's been an honor to be here.
- Take these for the road.
- Thank you, darling.
I'll see you on the runway.
- All right.
- All right, mama.
- What's going on?
- Oh, other than
losing my mind?
I'm having a hell of a time.
- All you need to remember
is that right now,
you're in the heat
of the competition,
there's only three of you left,
but once this is all done,
regardless if you win
and get that prize
and the crown
and so on,
your life is about to
absolutely fucking change.
- Right.
- Of course it's better to win.
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's better to win.
- Yes, yes.
- Well, you know,
I'm used to being a loser,
but I really hope that I do win.
I want to let every loser
out there know
that there can be a giant crown
on their head.
There are so many of me's,
all around the world.
People who want to
express themselves
in unconventional ways.
If I win<i> RuPaul's Drag race,</i>
it will definitely show them
that anything is possible.
- Let's just go over
some of it.
- All I ever wanted was to be
a female phenomenon.
- [laughing]
I like the fact that you can
modify your voice,
'cause I've never
had that talent.
- I modify my voice
all the time.
- Yeah.
[laughs]
- Girl.
- I'll be Ru.
You ready?
- Uh-huh.
- You sure?
- Punch her! Hit her! Get her!
- Ohh!
- Hey! Yes!
- Uhh! Oh!
- Damn bitch knocked
my bracelet off.
- Work!
That was awesome.
Ohh!
- Phi Phi, darling!
- You look amazing.
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- No, for real.
- Are you hungry?
- I'm hungry.
- Well, that's what
everyone says--
you're so hungry and
ambitious.
- I have a drive,
and I have a strong drive,
and I really
wanted to prove to you guys
and show you guys,
especially you,
that I can do whatever it takes.
- Does that come from having
an army dad,
where you feel like,
"I want daddy's approval"?
- I mean, I haven't talked to
him for seven years now.
- What was the last thing
you said to him?
- It was a fight, actually.
I-I don't even remember.
I was put in the hospital.
- By him?
- By him, on my 18th birthday,
so I haven't--
there wasn't many words.
[laughs] So...
- Wow.
- But I'm here!
So--so it's okay.
If anything, it taught me to be,
you know, a fighter and stay
strong and...
I guess, because I grew up in
such a situation,
I feel like maybe
it felt like
it was normal at times, but...
I shouldn't have felt that way.
- I want you to walk away
from this luncheon
and remember this idea
that you would deserve
to be abused
or not thought of
as absolutely beautiful,
never think that again.
- I really feel like
we connected,
and she understands
a lot more of the heart
of who I am.
- So, um, what's it been like
so far?
Who's your biggest competition?
- Sharon Needles.
We're like kindred spirits.
- Yeah.
- And, um...
- Have you guys ki-kied?
- [laughing] No, we have not
ki-kied.
- What's your relationship like
with Phi Phi?
- She's definitely comin'
after me.
But it's okay!
You know, we got a big age
difference between us.
And I've commented on Phi Phi's
maturity level,
but I also have
to remember she's 25,
and I remember when I was 25.
- Well, I'm 23.
- You're that young?
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.
- Only 23.
- And look at your position.
- Though we've had our spats,
maybe I'm not tolerating
that amazing kid
for who she is.
- So really just go for it
and be larger than life
about it.
You know?
- You promised to make me
a panther on the runway.
- Well, stand in line, girly.
- Slap her!
Uhh! Yeah!
Ohh! There you go.
Woooork.
- If I knew it was so formal,
I would have changed.
- [laughing]
- You look absolutely stunning.
- Why, thank you.
- Even from this close,
you can't clock a lace-front,
girl.
You gotta love that.
I'm just--I'm looking
for a problem.
- Well, there are several.
So, now, Sharon, I know you have
people back in Pittsburgh
that you love
and that you're worried about
what this experience would
do to the relationship.
- Oh, most definitely.
- We're talking about Alaska,
aren't we?
- Alaska has tried out for this
competition all four years.
I've tried out for this
competition once--this year.
I just wish I could
speak to him,
you know, and just see
if it was okay.
- What would you say?
I'm Alaska.
What would you say?
- I love you so much
and, in my eyes,
you're the biggest
superstar in the universe.
I just pray this doesn't
do any damage.
- I'm gonna tell you what
Alaska would say.
It's fine.
I would never stand in the way
of your success,
which is your destiny.
- Hmm.
- And Alaska has a destiny.
We all have a journey,
and it is up to you
to see it through.
- RuPaul gives nothing more
than good advice.
But I definitely have a fear of
success and fame.
It intimidates me.
- All right, see you later.
- [mouth full] Yes, ma'am.
- Needles.
How'd it go, mama?
What's wrong, baby?
Aww.
[chuckles]
It's okay. It's okay.
- Touching little witch.
- [laughs]
- God!
I knew this was all
coming to an end,
and it was the first time
I really realized
that everything truly
is going to be different.
And this is a big deal.
Oh, jeez, Louise.
- What's goin' on?
- Not much. Top three.
- Yeah!
Whoo hoo hoo!
- I know, it's crazy.
- Do you think
that you being young
has been a challenge for you
in this competition?
- Well, I'm 25.
I think a lot of people use that
as kind of like a...
like an excuse, really.
And I don't let that--
- Well, when I did the show,
I was 21.
So don't let anyone, like,
hold you back.
- Oh, I haven't.
- Being young is being fun.
- Just like me, everybody was
ganging up on Tyra
because she was the baby,
or they felt like she had
too much attitude.
So the fact that someone can win
at a young age
and still be a great role model
and America's next drag
superstar,
why can't I?
- Now sashay!
- Uhh!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
- Shante! Shante! Shante!
- Aah!
- Why does the little one
get beat up?
Uhh!
- Wonder how ol'
Phi Phi's doing.
- Disneying it up somewhere.
- In a way,
I feel bad about, like,
saying some of the shit
I said to her.
I feel bad.
- Yeah, I know.
- Who the fuck am I
to tell her to grow up?
- [humming]
- How was it?
- It went really, really well.
- I just want to say something
to you.
- To me?
- [crying] I'm sorry for saying
for you to grow up, because...
I know that you're just a kid,
and you deserve to be 25
and have fun and be stupid
and flippant and crazy
and blow it out, because,
before you know it,
you're gonna be 40.
And I love you for who you are.
- [tearful chuckle]
- And everything you aren't.
I'm sorry.
- Don't cry.
Ah, give me a hug.
Mmm.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry
I'm annoying sometimes.
- You're not, though.
You're not.
- I'm not sorry,
but I like you.
- [laughing] Shut up.
We really are sisters.
No matter how different we are,
as much as we probably
don't want to admit it,
we're a family.
[clapper snaps]
- Gorgeous.
- It's time to shoot our scenes
with RuPaul.
It's very exciting.
- Here we go.
First positions, please.
If you don't do it properly,
the dog's going to die.
- [laughs]
- Action.
[triumphant music]
When you hit your marks,
defiant.
- Not so fast, "Rude Paul."
- Yeah, get a load of us,
stupid-model of the world.
- Yeah, grandpa!
We're here to throw a wrench
in your plans.
Uhh!
[clang]
- Bitch, that wrench came
awful close to this face.
- [laughs]
Try not to hit RuPaul.
Action.
- You had no intention
of giving up your crown.
- You'd love to replace me,
wouldn't you?
Well, take a number
and stand in line!
- Uhh!
- And cut.
Slap her.
I didn't believe that
for a second.
[beep]
- Chad Michaels
is a little prissy.
- Ouch!
- But she takes direction well.
She's slapping you.
That's gotta hurt.
- Ohh! Oh!
Oh! Uhh...
Oh! Ooh!
- Beautiful!
- Uhh!
- I very much appreciate
Chad's efforts.
- Are you all right, darling?
- I love it.
- [laughing]
- Okay.
Which brings us along
to Sharon Needles.
- Uh-huh.
- Sell it to me.
- Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
[gasps]
[thud]
- Sharon, you should
probably go, "uhh," forward.
- Got it.
Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
[gasps]
Hyuh!
Ah! Ugh!
Agh!
- Everybody say love.
- Anyone who gets
the opportunity
to have RuPaul kick
the shit out of them
should consider themselves
a very lucky individual.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Yes, sir.
- It's your turn to shine.
- This is my last time that
I can really impress Ru,
so I don't want to mess this up.
I wanna win this.
- Action.
- And you, my pretty?
- RuPaul, what happened
to that innocent kid
from the Brewster projects
with the pair of heels
and--and a dream?
- And cut.
Can we ratchet that back
just a few notches?
It was a little Dorothy,
<i>Wizard of Oz</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on crack.</i>
- [chuckles] Okay.
What happened to that
supermodel of the world?
Ohh! Aah! Ohh!
[groaning]
- Good girl, Phi Phi.
Let's do it one more time.
On your marks...
get set...
action!
- Well, take a number
and stand in line.
- Ohh!
This competition, it's like
graduating high school
and going to Yale.
- Ohh!
- It's taken 18 years
to get here,
and it's validation
and redemption.
- I looked up to you.
- I've never worked on
something this hard
in my entire life.
There's just been ups and downs.
I've made enemies.
I've made best friends
for a lifetime.
I just feel like I could
conquer anything now.
Anything.
- Sashay.
- Oww!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
To be here and be able
to share my story
and grow as an entertainer,
I'm just super happy.
And I wouldn't trade that
for the world.
- May the best glamazon win!
- I am America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
- My name is Chad Michaels,
and I'm America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I am America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
[coughing]
- And cut.
It's a wrap.
So thank you, ladies.
Great job.
- Thank you, ladies.
- And RuPaul will be available
for actual beatings later.
[laughter]
- Guys, it's the last day!
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- Me too.
- It's the big day.
It's the last day here.
And someone's gonna be
crowned today.
- One of us is going to be
America's next drag superstar.
- Isn't that insane?
- How do you feel you did
on your video?
- I feel good about it.
- Consistently throughout
this entire challenge,
I felt like I did really well,
with the dancing and everything.
- I found the dancing
challenging.
Structured choreography
is just hard on me.
- From day one till now,
starring in Ru's new video,
<i>Glamazon,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
this has been
the journey of a lifetime.
- So how do you think
it's gonna feel
to be on the main stage
for the last time?
- It's gonna feel amazing.
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous too.
- I worked so hard, and...
to be told I'm not gonna win,
it would just kill me.
- I'm, like, seriously shaking.
Ah!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- So who do you think
is lip-synching
for the win tonight, girls?
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Sharon Needles.
- Chad Michaels.
- One of you guys is correct.
[laughter]
- Only two will be lip-synching
for the crown.
And, oh, I hope
I'm one of them.
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag race.</i>
This evening is extra-special.
Because tonight,
it's just family.
Michelle Visage!
- Hot mama!
- [laughs]
- Our little girls have
all grown up.
- It makes me weep.
- Shake the dice
and steal the rice!
Hey, Santino.
- Whew! I want a taste
of that honey!
- Anytime, honey.
Now, are you ready to crown
a champion?
- He's crowning as we speak.
- [laughs]
- This week, our queens
were challenged
to star as rompin',
stompin' glamazons
in my new music video.
Tonight, they're ready to pummel
the runway one last time.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
- Chad Michaels!
Wow.
- That's Donatella Michaels.
- Ver-sassy.
- My look is Versace-inspired,
but it's also a little bit of
Jane Fonda<i> Barbarella.</i>
It's a power costume.
- Who knew she was
a bondage queen?
- Ah.
- Strap it on, baby.
- Super hero.
Sharon Needles.
- Ah, oh, yes.
- I'm hungry for some calamari.
- Sharon Scissorhands.
- You're squiddin' me,
Michelle.
- I squid you not, girl.
- I am giving them straight up
Sharon Needles fierceness.
Fashion forward
to the dark side.
- I think she's opening a can
of worms, if you ask me.
- [laughs]
- Touch all of this octopussy,
honey.
[laughter]
Phi Phi O'Hara!
Ooh!
Leopard on the runway.
- Flintstones 2012.
- Yabba dabba do me.
- [laughs]
- I wanted to give that
Wilma Flintstone realness.
I'm feelin' sexy
and I'm showin' body.
I'm just having a great time.
- She's the side piece Fred was
knockin' boots with.
- [laughs]
Phi Phi Flintstone.
She's gonna make your bed rock.
Welcome, ladies.
My top three girls.
Let's begin by watching
the world television premiere
of your acting scene.
[thunder crashing]
[electronic blooping]
Now that I've perfected my super
size queen glamazon spray,
my sinister plan for world
domination is nearly complete!
[laughing]
Ohh.
- Not so fast, "Rude Paul"!
[dramatic music]
- Get a load of us,
stupid-model of the world.
- Yeah, grandpa!
We're here to throw a wrench
in your plans!
Uhh!
- Nice try, ladies.
But you lose.
Again.
[clang]
- You promised to make me
a panther on the runway!
But all you did was lock me up
in that smelly old workroom.
You had no intention of
giving up your crown.
- You'd love to replace me,
wouldn't you?
Well, take a number
and stand in line.
- Uhh!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Oh! Agh! Uhh!
[whimpers]
- You love to make me hit you.
- [whimpers]
- All I ever wanted to do was
to be a female phenomenon.
I looked up to you.
We all looked up to you.
Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
- Love. Ah, yes.
I was in love once.
It was the worst 20 minutes
of my life.
- [gasps]
Hyuh! Ah!
Uhh! Hyuh!
Ohh!
[groans]
- Everybody say love.
And you, my pretty?
- RuPaul, what happened to that
innocent kid from
the Brewster projects
who became a shining example
for dreamers everywhere?
What happened to that supermodel
of the world?
- You're right.
I am that supermodel
of the world.
- Ohh! Aah!
Oww! Oww! Uhh! Ahh!
- Now...sashay...
- Ohh!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
- Shante, shante, shante!
- Aah!
- My super size queen
glamazon spray
should take effect any moment.
First, you'll destroy the world.
Then you'll destroy each other.
[laughing]
May the best glamazon win.
[cackling]
[laughter]
- All right.
- Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles...
it's time for your performances
in the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[upbeat music]
- [screaming]
- She's so bloody tall.
[laughter]
- Wow, beautiful.
- The one thing I can count on
Chad doing well is,
you do this thing where
everything has a flourish.
- It's all this, girl.
- Yes! Oh, my god!
I could watch you do that
forever!
- It's old-school.
- Don't ever stop doing that.
- I don't think I can,
'cause it's, like,
one of three tricks
that I have.
[laughter]
- Old-school or not,
it's really refreshing
to watch you.
- Oh! Ohh!
- You played well with Ru.
I thought you were
very convincing.
It was funny, and I actually
wish some of that
lightheartedness
and your sense of humor
would have been
in your monster stomping.
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
- I'm so glad that you came out
tonight
for the finale in your
California natural look.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, this is succubus
ready to wear.
- I love your stomping monster.
Very campy.
- But the choreography
and the dancing,
it was a little rough.
It looked a little shaky
in parts.
- When dancing
isn't your thing,
you can either own it,
or you can really fail.
You gotta be ready for
any challenge, you know?
- All right, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I'll start with your
runway look tonight,
because I love it.
- Oh, thank you.
- Your stomping, that was
probably
your weakest thing,
'cause it looked more like
you were doing a runway.
I just got like, "I'm cute,
I'm fierce, let me walk."
- But I think your dance moves
were very tight and on beat.
Your range of energy was really
unbelievable in that video.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
While you
and the other girls untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, just between us
"goils," what do you think?
- Oh, Ru.
- This is it, and they all
represent
three different
factions of drag.
Phi Phi is the ingénue newcomer.
Chad, the professional diva.
And Sharon Needles,
the little monster.
They could all represent this
competition so brilliantly.
- This is a tough one, baby.
- Let's start with
Sharon Needles.
- Sharon needles was
an underdog.
She came out here looking like
Nosferatu on the first show.
- She won that challenge.
- I know she did,
because she did it fiercely.
- Sharon always came out here,
week after week,
with something
conceptual and creative.
And I think that sometimes
people are scared of things
that are unconventional.
- I like the goth,
but I feel like,
"Do you have to do it
all the time?"
I don't know if the entire world
is ready
for somebody to win
this competition
like a Sharon Needles.
- Well, listen,
Lady Gaga's done it.
- Sharon's even beyond
Lady Gaga, I think.
- All right, kids.
Chad Michaels.
- There is nobody more
qualified than Chad Michaels.
The bitch is a<i> professional.</i>
Her representing your show
would be executed perfectly.
- It's great that Chad probably
had those
Versace dresses
in her closet from
the early '90s.
- Yes, a little old-school,
but Chad grew up in a different
time period
where drag was
what Chad does.
- It's not so much
the age thing,
'cause Chad is ageless.
- Age ain't nothin'.
- It's about
evolving constantly
and looking at what's next
and what's new.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
At one point,
I thought she was too green,
but, boy, has she grown,
faster than any other competitor
we have ever seen.
- And what she lacks
in experience,
she makes up for with drive.
- If you remember,
she's gotten some heat
for being too ambitious.
Do you think that's a bad thing?
- No, it probably is what's
driving her creativity.
You know, you see it in the way
that she's evolved.
- And I feel like with Phi Phi,
she's the new
generation of drag.
- Silence!
This ain't over...
till they lip-synch
for their lives.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
The moment of truth is upon us.
Based on your performance
in the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> music video</i>
and your body of work
throughout this competition,
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
you are a seasoned queen.
But do you represent
the future of drag?
Phi Phi O'Hara,
my beautiful queen...
in this competition, no one
has ever grown so fast.
But are you fully prepared
for the responsibilities
that come with the crown?
Sharon Needles, you are
as charming as you are scary.
And you shake drag to its core.
But do you have the right stuff
to be America's next drag
superstar?
For the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
we are breaking
all the rules.
- What?
- Chad, Sharon, Phi Phi.
The three of you
will lip-synch for your lives.
Three queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and prove to the world
that you are America's
next drag superstar.
- This is everything
I've worked for,
all coming to
a head in one moment,
and I'm gonna give it
all I've got.
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- It's just a tornado
of emotions.
But I've never been afraid
of an audience,
and I'm not gonna
start now.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I am giving them
a little bit of spook,
a little bit of laugh,
and a whole lot of diva action.
- I want to show the judges
that I'm a true entertainer.
I am America's next
drag superstar.
- This is my time
in the spotlight.
I'm feeling pretty powerful
right now.
- She's so bloody tall.
- Hoo hoo!
[cheers and applause]
[laughing]
- I love you bitches.
- Love you too.
- Brava! Brava!
Ladies...
I've made my decision.
- Chad Michaels...
Phi Phi O'Hara...
Sharon Needles...
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
America's next drag superstar...
is...
Going to be announced
next week...
On<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
- Is this a joke?
- RuPaul, you crafty
little witch.
- And I want to hear from you,
the viewers.
Who should be America's next
drag superstar?
Should it be Chad Michaels?
Sharon Needles?
Or Phi Phi O'Hara?
Let your voice be heard.
Tweet your thoughts to
#dragrace.
Ladies, I'll see you and your
drag sisters next week,
where, together,
we will celebrate our new queen.
- No matter what, I'm still
gonna win that crown.
- This is uncharted territory.
This has never been done.
I don't know
what's gonna happen.
- Any one of us deserve
that crown.
Maybe me a little more.
- Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.


<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the one, the only...</i>
<i>RuPaul.</i>
<i>- This is the Glamazon edition</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>Stuffed and tucked with</i>
<i>everything you love and more.</i>
- There's a hole in my stomach!
<i>- Plus, never-before-seen</i>
<i>footage</i>
<i>from the you better work room.</i>
- Yes, I know how
to sop it up, girl!
<i>- Then it's celebrities</i>
<i>caught on tape,</i>
<i>with exclusive outtakes</i>
<i>from the judges' panel.</i>
- I felt like I was maybe
about to watch
some sort of an adult,
erotic film of sorts.
- Oh, dear.
- And watch out,
fashion police.
We're counting down the most
sickening fits and fashions
with the arresting Chanel,
Mariah, and Pandora Boxx.
- So don't go anywhere.
The Glamazon edition
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is ready to let you have it,
Auntie.
Can I get an amen up in here?
Cameroon?
[weakly] Anybody?
Helloo?
- Are you making fun of me,
Michelle?
- Some drag queens
can be so touchy.
[slap]
- Welcome to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Thanks to you, this season has
been the biggest drag ever.
Let's flash back and share
some extra-special footage
that no one's seen.
Take a look at the casting tapes
that tried to snatch
my attention,
including some familiar faces.
<i>- Oh, shit,</i>
<i>that's the wrong song!</i>
<i>- Can you believe I walk around</i>
<i>with no eyebrows, child?</i>
<i>- Gah! Eat it, bitch! Aah!</i>
<i>- Why do you want me?</i>
<i>Um...look at me.</i>
<i>- I split, my butt cheeks</i>
<i>hit the floor.</i>
<i>Who does that?</i>
<i>This bitch.</i>
<i>- Miss Phi Phi</i>
<i>does not like to lose.</i>
<i>- What is this? I don't even</i>
<i>know what this means.</i>
<i>Why am I even here today?</i>
<i>- You said you come in for Chad</i>
<i>Michaels in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>- The first Latin</i>
<i>Puertorriquena that win!</i>
<i>- I...will...</i>
<i>take my Vaseline out.</i>
<i>- Oh, I see, so this is some</i>
<i>sort of free</i>
<i>public service announcement</i>
<i>for some drag queen.</i>
<i>You know what? I don't</i>
<i>have time for this shit.</i>
<i>- I will take my earrings off.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna do</i>
<i>whatever it takes.</i>
<i>- I don't give up.</i>
<i>- Get rid of the pretty</i>
<i>and knock a bitch out.</i>
<i>- The Princess.</i>
<i>Now, when you hear that name,</i>
<i>you're thinking, well,</i>
<i>she thinks pretty</i>
<i>damn highly of herself.</i>
<i>- My friend wanna be</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>'cause she this friend name</i>
<i>Willam who's hella cool.</i>
<i>- I got charisma, uniqueness,</i>
<i>nerve, and talent.</i>
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure that's what</i>
<i>you're looking for, Ru.</i>
<i>- I think that,</i>
<i>in this business,</i>
<i>we all should be sisters,</i>
<i>we all should be friends.</i>
<i>We're one of a kind,</i>
<i>so we all should have our backs</i>
<i>and support everybody, and</i>
<i>that's my philosophy on that.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna win of this</i>
<i>competition!</i>
<i>- Win the competition.</i>
<i>- I came to win.</i>
<i>- I'm a fucking Oscar-winner!</i>
<i>I'm out of here!</i>
<i>- Oh! Hi.</i>
<i>I didn't see you come in there.</i>
<i>Welcome to my home.</i>
<i>- This one's my favorite</i>
<i>that I made.</i>
<i>I actually just made it.</i>
<i>Pins on just like this.</i>
<i>- Hairpieces that I make.</i>
<i>I do big hair too, but you--oh.</i>
<i>It's coming apart</i>
<i>like Shangela hair,</i>
<i>something to do with this.</i>
<i>- This, believe it or not,</i>
<i>is a shower curtain.</i>
<i>And, believe me,</i>
<i>it has many, many uses.</i>
<i>- I made this little</i>
<i>piece right here.</i>
<i>This is from white party.</i>
<i>- I definitely see,</i>
<i>like, Britney Spears</i>
<i>wearing something like this.</i>
<i>- You'll see my Dolly Parton</i>
<i>hair over here.</i>
<i>- Well, here we have a drag</i>
<i>queen's best friend--sequins.</i>
<i>Oh, that just bounces off of my</i>
<i>face, and it's just making me</i>
<i>just so sickening.</i>
<i>- There's a hole in my stomach!</i>
<i>I'm a big fan of, like, punk</i>
<i>rock,</i>
<i>and I'm not talking, like,</i>
<i>Pat Benatar punk rock, honey.</i>
<i>I'm talking like Jane Wayne</i>
<i>County punk rock.</i>
<i>[glass shatters]</i>
<i>- I'll send her home, girl.</i>
<i>- You--</i>
<i>- I can lip-sync the shit</i>
<i>out of you, girl.</i>
<i>- I mean--oh...</i>
<i>- Girl.</i>
<i>- Well, that's because you do</i>
<i>songs that everyone knows.</i>
<i>- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</i>
<i>- I love him more than</i>
<i>anything.</i>
<i>And I do really mean that,</i>
<i>baby.</i>
<i>- I love you too, sweetheart.</i>
<i>- Let's go on TV and be famous.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>Mm, mm.</i>
- 13 exceptional queens were
invited to join the race.
And when they received
the good news,
their reactions
were truly touching.
<i>[Thus Spake Zarathustra]</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>I made it?</i>
<i>What--what--like,</i>
<i>I'm on the show?</i>
<i>- Whoo!</i>
<i>- Aah! Ha!</i>
<i>- [laughing]</i>
<i>- [gasps]</i>
<i>- [laughing]</i>
<i>- Shut your mouth.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
<i>This is it. This is it!</i>
<i>This is it!</i>
<i>- So I think you guys</i>
<i>should do this:</i>
<i>You guys should probably</i>
<i>fit me for the crown,</i>
<i>'cause I plan</i>
<i>on taking it home.</i>
<i>- It's gonna be an honor to be</i>
<i>a part of this part</i>
<i>of drag history.</i>
<i>- I'm so grateful, so,</i>
<i>so grateful to you guys.</i>
<i>- Whew! Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I'm going to be on fucking</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race.
<i>Season 4.</i>
<i>- So how does that</i>
<i>make you feel?</i>
<i>- Yay. Ooh,</i>
<i>my teeth look good too.</i>
- Once they arrived,
these girls wasted no time
doing what drag queens do best--
ki ki!
Now, I proudly present the world
premiere of...
<i>Shit My Girls Say.</i>
- The library is now open.
- No sale, no search, no shade.
- No shade.
- No shade.
- No shade, no tea.
- Work.
- No tea.
- No tea, no shade.
- No tea, no shade.
- Girl...
- No, but no shade, no tea.
- Ooh!
- Oww!
- The category is cheesecake.
- Cheesecake.
- Eat it!
- I will never be late
for dinner.
- Eat it!
- Bella!
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?
- Bitch, you are a fish!
- Gorgeous fish.
- Eat it. Eat it!
- I'm probably gonna get read
for Phil...for Phil...for Phil.
- Beat that wig!
- Beating the face, girl.
- Yeah, but not literally
beating my face.
- I am trying!
- A post-apocolake--apocolake.
A post-apocolake.
Apocolake.
That's all I--
that's how I say it.
- I love being a woman.
- I love pussy.
- Yes, who doesn't?
- They all assume that
I want to be a woman,
like, and I don't.
- You gotta find the inner diva.
- Lookin' fabulous!
- Work it, girl.
- Put some foam around that ass.
- When making your ass, always
draw the shape of Africa.
- This is gonna look a hot mess.
- Should I tuck?
- All you have to do is dip it
in some apple cider vinegar
and it tightens right back up.
[kiss]
- Daylight is no friend
of the dragoon.
- Dry those tears and powder
those cheekbones, okay?
- This is called
cutting a cheek.
- You know how much garbage
comes out of these
over-painted lips.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Girl, no.
- My moustache
is gonna start showing.
- People don't even know how
much of a man
it takes to be a drag queen.
- Where the fuck are my tits?
- If you have a cameltoe,
that's perfect.
- This season, with all
the backstage conflama--
that's "conflict" and "drama"--
we couldn't fit it all
into the series.
So let's start
with some sassy outtakes
from the You Better Work room.
- If we had to imitate
somebody in here,
- Okay, but Willam--
- I would do Willam.
- Willam, 'cause, you know--
[laughter]
- Hold on, hold on.
I'm actressing.
You can catch me
on<i> Sex and the City</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and--</i>
[laughter]
Extras for--
- Oh, my God!
- Any extra that they ever
needed a gay prostitute.
- Willam.
- And the category is?
- Oh, my God!
[laughs]
- People must just look at you
and be like,
"Oh, my God, Jujubee!"
- That's the Lane Bryant
Jujubee.
- She went to a buffet before
she entered the race.
- Wow.
- Really, bitch?
- She is a bitch.
I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.
What does "bitch" mean?
both: Being In Total
Control Of Herself.
- Bitch!
[laughter]
- Does anyone know any good
drag toasts for drinks?
- Here's to women,
women divine,
they bloom every month,
they bear every nine,
the only of God's creatures
this side of hell
that they could get juice from
a nut without cracking a shell.
- Oh!
- I got one too.
Here's to the girl
in the little brown shoes.
She'll eat your man
and drink your booze.
She'll eat your cherry
and drink your gin,
but thank God I got my deep
brown box my cherry came in.
- Cheers!
- Michelle,
you look fantastic.
- Thank--Sharon, thank you,
thank you.
- Say, you know,
the thing about me and RuPaul--
when we go down to a gay bar,
we both get mistaken
for drag queens.
[laughter]
I don't know!
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
It's just me.
- You know what,
Cher, I like you,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
- Tell me.
- You don't give a fuck.
- I don't give a rat's ass.
- And that's what I like
about you.
- I don't give a rat's ass.
You know, I'm every
gay man's best friend.
And that's a lot of holes
to fill.
- [laughs]
Now, I created
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
to elevate the art of drag.
But I know you all love it
when these bitches get shady.
Roll the tape.
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?
Y'all look like a sweatshop.
- Jiggly too--she talkin'
about she saw this thing.
- Who?
- Her.
- This bitch is shady.
- That smelly bitch,
she got nerve.
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you, you monster.
- Me? I'm monster?
- Yeah, you.
- Who's the big one in here?
- Girl, you look like a horse.
- Roar.
- You look like a horse.
- You wanna call me a horse,
honey, that's fine.
Horses have gorgeous legs,
and these legs will kick.
- You look like you've been
kicking, all right--
kicking flour.
Put some lotion on them
ashy-ass knees.
- Bitch, bye, boo!
- You ugly,
and I'm at peace with it.
[laughter]
- Willam's school for bitches
is now opening,
accepting enrollments
for the 2011--
- I already graduated.
- Nurse. Like, "Oh, nurse."
- Nurse.
- Yeah, 'cause she needs help.
And nurses help people.
Nurse.
- Did this bitch really
just come for me?
- Ooh, nurse!
- All that venom inside you,
mama.
We need to do an extraction.
- Out of me?
- Yeah.
- You think I'm evil?
- Didn't Sharon look pretty
yesterday?
- What?
- Sharon. I was shocked.
- [laughs]
- Don't think about it.
What makes you happy? Food?
Food makes you happy, right?
- I know you have low
self-esteem,
so I'll let you think you won.
- Thank you.
- Your attitude sucks.
It sucks, and you suck.
- I can't hear you.
- What did you read me about
now, you bitch?
- Girl, you're so insecure.
Nobody was even
talking about you.
Paint your face.
- You're such a rude bitch,
Phi Phi.
- Oh, well.
You might not have to deal
with it for long.
- [chuckling]
- Just like<i> Glee,</i>
there's something
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
that makes a queen just
break out in song.
- I'm Latrice!
- Cover girl!
Why your base look like chalk?
[all howling with laughter]
You can't walk!
- You better do it, bitch!
- Walk.
Don't walk.
Walk!
- She is so stupid.
- Don't walk!
[laughter]
[claps]
- [laughs]
- There you go!
- Did she just say "A biscuit"?
- Yeah.
- What's that mean,
"Jesus is a biscuit"?
- Let him sop you up.
- Sop you up?
- Sop up stuff with a biscuit.
- You do?
- Y'all so white
and Anglo-Saxon and shit.
Y'all never heard of
sopping it up with a biscuit?
- No.
- No, seriously, what's sop up?
- Sopping it up means you, like,
take your syrup
and your biscuit or whatever,
and you sop it up.
- Yeah, I do eat that.
- You know about sopping it up--
- Oh, you take
the biscuit after--
when it's on your plate,
and you go...
- That's soppin' it up!
- That's soppin' it--
yes, I know how to sop it up,
girl!
- Now, a lot of what happens
during filming
is just too hot to air, so label
these next clips N.S.F.W.--
Not safe for the workroom.
- There's a bunch of booties
back here.
- Mama, somebody left, like,
a dirty Kotex in my station.
- Aah! I think Phi Phi
might be in heat.
- Guys, my butt hurts.
- [trilling]
- If you fart, bitch, I swear.
'cause you's a gassy ho.
- [laughing] I can't.
- You never know which end
it's gonna come out of.
- [burps]
- Rick Santorum is,
if you google his name,
there is a filthy, filthy
definition that comes up,
because a gay man
was smart enough to make it
an urban dictionary word
or something.
And he hates gay people.
So I'm glad that
it's called that.
- Oh...my God.
I did not know all this.
- The queens just love to sit
around the table
debating hot topics.
It's like<i> The View,</i>
only more ladylike.
Hey, Miss Hasselbeck,
no tea, no shade.
Word up, girl.
- What president do you think
or have you found to be
the best or good-looking?
You know, like, the hottest
president we've had?
- Oh, my Mr. Obama.
- You think he's hot?
- Absolutely, he's so handsome.
- You do him? Yeah?
- Absolutely, and then I think--
- Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton.
- That's who I got my vote.
- Eww.
- When he first started,
he was hot.
- But President Obama, he's--
I've always thought he was just
so handsome and so charismatic.
- Lincoln was kind of cute.
He was really, really--
he was really tall and--
- In like a woodsman
kind of way.
- Yeah, and he wore, like,
a steampunk's top hat.
He looked really punk.
- Didn't George Washington
wear wigs?
- He did.
- So he could
double our collection.
- And Taft, if you're
a chubby chaser.
He was all right.
He's the one that got stuck
in the tub.
- Huh.
- Wow.
- Doing what?
- The one thing I didn't get is,
what is with the wig wars
when drag queens snatch off
their wigs during a lip-sync?
- Well, I mean--
- Like, you took off
a sequined dress,
and your wig stayed on.
And then, all of a sudden,
she just pulls her off.
- Well, you know, I felt like
you're in the moment,
and that song has so much
angst going on in it,
and I literally couldn't, like,
the hair was in my face.
- Well, that's one thing.
- So I was like,
"I gotta get rid of this hair,
so they can see my lips."
- But why did she
pull off her wig?
- It just--y'all,
they got down, girl.
They got down.
- It's lip sync for your life.
You know?
- If the wig falls off,
it falls off,
but I am not personally
taking that bitch off.
- It's all staying on, bitch,
when I do it.
- All those pins in there--
bitch, I had, like,
40 pins in my head.
- That's a desperate cry
for attention.
- A little<i> I Am What I am,</i>
<i>La Cage.</i>
- You know? Yeah.
But it's, like, unnecessary.
I understand you're born
this way, but...
- Right.
- Yeah, right now, you gotta be
a woman and stay a woman.
And you're killing my illusion.
- Where do you stand on these
very important issues?
Tweet your thoughts
to #DragRace,
and I will retweet my favorites.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's time to flashback to the
queens' most memorable moments.
All right, boys.
Let me see what you got.
Now the first queen to leave us
was Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- Hallelu!
I'm back, bitches.
[group groans]
Hallelu is in the building.
- After trying to crash
the party one more time,
I had her removed
from the competition...
[cheering]
And sent some place where
they'd really appreciate
her style and humor.
- [screaming]
- Let's just say
the zombies ate her up.
- Aah, hallelu!
Hallelu!
- Hello, how y'all doing?
- Alisa Summers experienced
quite a lot
in her short time here.
She braved exposure
to toxic waste.
- Do we get a barf bag?
- Aah!
- And a zombie attack.
But her post-apocalyptic runway
couture
didn't devastate our judges...
and Alisa Summers
did not survive.
Now, Lashauwn Beyond
was something unique
to this competition...
a shy drag queen.
- Hi, queen one.
- Hi.
- Now, her apocalyp--
her--her [indistinct]
- "Post-apocolake."
- Her couture was
out of this world.
But Lashauwn lacked nerve.
And it do take nerve.
What can't you believe?
- That I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey,
you better snap out of it.
But in week two, Lashauwn
was sent to the great beyond.
all: Whoa.
- Hi.
- The Princess,
a reserved extrovert,
struggled to let
her sparkle shine.
- [singing]
Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?
- After lackluster performances,
the judges felt The Princess
didn't have enough
zing in her Zen.
But she'll live forever
as Drag Race royalty.
- Hi, y'all.
- [screaming]
- What's the Spanish word
for roller coaster?
I bet Madame Laqueer knows,
because that was her ride
on Drag Race.
She won the wrestling
competition...
- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.
- [chuckles]
- But was always the last person
picked for teams.
- I wouldn't want to choose
Madame for my team
because I don't want her.
- She was team captain
for the sitcom challenge.
- [screams]
- But after a Razzie-worthy
performance,
Madame Laqueer
had to sashay away.
- Hey,
there's a new girl in town.
Let's get to business.
- Next stop, Paris, London,
Milan.
- Mahogany.
- This queen brought Broadway
experience to the competition.
- That young man look pretty
mature enough
to handle a beaver on his own.
- Um, Milan.
You're kind of
playing this stuff out here.
Look at the person
that you're talking to.
- Sorry.
- Her fierce lip sync helped her
stay in the game.
But the third time
was not a charm.
And Milan was sent back
to Broadway.
- Hi.
- What's good, ladies?
- Next up,
Miss Jiggly Caliente.
- [singing]
- And yes,
you may call her Jiggly.
She started strong, by winning
the toxic photo shoot.
- Yeah!
[cheering]
- But her hoarding couture
put her up for elimination.
- I'm getting
my eyeballs assaulted.
- Her tough New York
attitude...
do you take the train and drive?
- Yes, mama,
I have to get to work.
- Jiggly will cut a bitch.
- Thank you.
- Soon gave way to self-doubt.
- What the hell
would I write about
how to eat a pound of chicken?
- Exactly, that's funny.
- Oh.
Damn.
- She fought hard
in the lip syncs.
But the third and final face off
was the last for this
plus-sized Barbie.
- Deuces.
[laughter]
- Willam's rare combination
of sexy and funny
made her the queen to beat.
- Ooh, a 26, damn.
We got some big girls.
I hope they don't have diabetes.
- Already a successful
working actor...
- You look really familiar, Ma.
- Me?
You must have a television.
- She never let us forget it.
- I was on<i> Boston Public</i>
with you.
I was the best friend
of Candace Kane when she died.
I died on<i> Nip/Tuck.</i>
<i>CSI: New York,</i>
<i>Women's Murder Club.</i>
- Is that Willam
dropping names over there?
- Her acting experience served
her well in the challenges...
- Willam, you're funny.
- Thank you, hire me.
[laughter]
And so did her sickening body.
- I hope that lotion's
waterproof.
- But when I discovered
that off-screen,
Willam had violated show rules,
I had no choice but to give
this sexy drag queen
the heave-ho.
Willam, it has come to my
attention
that you have broken the rules.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Now, sashay away.
- Category is...
all: Cheesecake!
- Our next queen was a tasty
slice of cheesecake.
Dida Ritz.
[cheering]
-<i> Bonjour,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ladies.</i>
- Feisty and lovable...
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.
- Dida won fans on the runway.
- Supermodel.
- The judges lived for her long
legs and catwalk stomping,
but felt her fashion sense
was a bit pedestrian.
- Outfit-wise, I wasn't moved
one way or the other.
- My name is Dida Ritz,
I'm here representing--
or running for Wig Party.
- Her presidential debate did
not win her any supporters...
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.
- And she was voted
off the show.
But had there been
a wig-whipping challenge,
Dida may just have gone
all the way.
- Hi, girls.
[cheering]
- Little Kenya Michaels
was a tiny queen
who posed a big threat
to the other girls.
- [laughs]
- She's cute.
- Fuck.
- Kenya was a spicy firebird
on the runway...
- Bella!
- And in the wrestling ring.
- Praise God!
[indistinct yelling]
- What did you just do?
- In the snatch game,
we weren't<i> Crazy In Love</i>
with her Beyonce impression.
Oh!
And Kenya was sent packing.
[kisses]
- Ay!
[cheering]
- But the judges felt Kenya
had more to offer,
and invited her back.
But when her makeover of a dad
turned into a dud...
- Being pregnant's hard.
- Macabre too, apparently.
- Yeah.
- It was<i> hasta la vista</i>
for this sexy senorita.
[kisses]
[cheering]
- Ow!
Eat it!
- Sit back, relax, and pour
yourself an ice cold glass
of miss Latrice Royale.
- The shade,
the shade of it all.
- Her curves and swerves had the
judges captivated,
and so did her body slams.
- Aah!
- Mmm.
Well, hello, gorgeous.
- As Large Marge, she killed it
in the sitcom challenge.
- Get those nuts
away from my face.
- Her full-bodied grace
and soul made her a contender
to win it all.
But when her canine couture
went to the dogs,
Latrice was sent home.
- I am Latrice Royale.
- Bitches better beware.
- Royale!
[applause]
- All my queens
are sickening, no?
But which one is your favorite?
Go to newnownext.com
and vote for Miss Congeniality.
Do it for your lips.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
The best seat in town
is the judges' table.
With my best squirrel friend,
Michelle Visage,
and my Judge Judys,
Santino Rice and Billy "V"
by my side--
well, things can get
a little bit stupid.
- If you do the research,
you won't have those
deer-in-headlights moments.
It's all the help.
- Did you just call her
the help?
- No, I said I'm here to help.
So I called myself the help.
- I see.
- It's okay because
I called myself the help,
and I am a black man...
dressed as a white woman.
- Yes.
- Sound familiar?
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]
- I did think of<i> Grey Gardens,</i>
that smell of cat piss.
- I thought that was me, so--
[laughter]
- When I look at you, it almost
looks like an<i> Austin Powers</i>
kind of joke or something.
If clothes looked like a couch,
or an ottoman, or a loveseat,
you just wanna stay away
from it, you know?
[barking]
- What did you just call me?
- And no matter where I am
in this studio,
I can hear her laughs.
And it's just the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.
- [laughing]
- Every time she laughs,
her nuts get bigger.
- This season,
the judges' panel
was more star-studded than ever.
They were looking good
and feeling gorgeous.
- With the tattoos,
I felt like I was maybe about
to watch some sort of an adult,
erotic film of sorts...
- Oh, dear.
- Which, not opposed to at all.
- Hello.
Well, welcome to the jungle.
-<i> America's got talent</i>
has nothing on this show.
- She looks like Divine Brown,
but we're trying to excite
America, not Hugh Grant.
- She was going for
<i>Sex and the City,</i>
and it was more like
"Sex in the Alley."
- Well, I'm not gonna
turn that down either.
- I really want a drag name.
- Jennifer Love Hewitt
is the best drag name
I have ever heard.
I'm changing my name
to RuPaul Love Hewitt.
- [laughs]
[thunder]
- The judges provided the queens
with constructive criticism,
but I swear, some of them was
jealous of they boogie.
- I appreciate those
hair and pants.
- You can have them
when I'm done.
- Okay, girl. They're mine.
- They're yours.
- 'Cause I love them.
- May I borrow
that hairpiece you had?
- The red one?
- Yes.
- I would like to borrow
your dress.
- You can have it.
- From your neck up,
I would decapitate you
and wear your head.
And I'm living for that ring.
- This is actually a broach.
I just threw a ring on it.
- Bitch.
- And PS, fuck you for having
the most amazing body ever.
- Your body is possibly
the sickest I've ever seen
on a queen in any season.
It's the legs, then she
turns around, it's the ass,
and that face--
my God.
- Your legs are really
something major,
and that is amazing.
- How dare they have better
legs than me?
How very dare they?
- Now, the celebrities weren't
just here to look fierce.
Once I scanned
their library cards,
those bitches
were ready to read.
- If we were gonna
go out on the town,
I'd pull you aside and say,
"Let's go look in your closet
closet and find something else."
- The wig looked like a litter
of kittens had sucked on it,
and she found it in the garbage.
- I would love to have
a cocktail with you.
Whether or not I would
get up to use the bathroom
and never come back,
I don't know.
[laughter]
- Is that a pot scrubber
on your head,
or are you just happy to see me?
- I was wondering,
after I painted my room,
where the drop cloth went.
- Yeah, there it is, right.
- That's where it was.
- Last night, my leftovers were
in the shape of aluminum foil
with a swan, you know?
- Mm-hmm.
- And somebody
put your leftovers
in the shape of Jiggly.
- [laughs]
- You know, that was a little
Jonbenet Ramsey.
That was a little creepy for me.
- You know, before,
I had a problem
with the makeup
every single time.
Today was the best
that it's been.
- Now, is that a read?
- A little bit.
- Uh-huh.
The celebrities also revealed
plenty of personal information
that we tastefully chose not
to include in the show...
until now.
I need more energy on the panel.
So I need about five hamsters.
Are there any in the building?
- Including her tits.
- [laughs]
- All right, Wy.
Winner of the challenge?
- This is very hard for me.
I feel like they should all
win something.
I'd rather go to the
gynecologist than do this.
- I'm gonna go
to the gynecologist
with you after this.
- I like a pap smear.
Count me in.
- I love ex-cons, but that's
a whole nother show.
- I've gotten in trouble
with a couple of those.
- I think it cheapens
you a little bit,
like a hooker in the Bronx.
- They're expensive.
- Oh. Oh, are they?
John said they're expensive.
- I have seen larger queens
turn it out.
- Yes, miss perky.
- Are you talking about
my chest?
- You've been talking about it
all day, you're so cute.
Go forward.
- I want her fondle me.
- I'll fondle you.
- There you go.
- Phone call for RuPaul?
Okay, yeah, all right.
Obama's calling me
real quick, hold on.
Somebody said you'd bumped your
head earlier.
How is your head?
- Haven't had
any complaints yet.
[laughter]
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, this season the runway was
a fashion phenomenon.
And to help me rate
the ra sha sha,
I've invited back
queens from all seasons.
Welcome the sensational Chanel,
that funny fox Pandora Boxx,
and last, but not least,
we call this queen Mariah.
Hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Are you ready to countdown
the top ten most sickening
fits and fashions of the runway?
- Uh, my tuck is on fire.
- Literally.
- Yes.
- Let's go.
Coming in at number ten,
Milan serving disco harem chic.
Burn, baby, burn.
- T.G.I.F.
She came out like
that was her last dance.
- [laughs]
- When she was dancing around,
it definitely took some flight
with the air into it.
It was hot, love it.
- Yes, is it something
you would wear?
- No, but I liked it, yeah.
- No? [laughs]
At number nine,
it's Jiggly Caliente
working her '80s retro look.
- Grey Jell-O never looked
so good.
[laughter]
There was the Missy Elliot
video where they, like,
pumped her full of air.
- Right, right.
- Sickening, and that gave me,
very much, that sort of feel.
I live for Jiggly.
I think she's amazing.
In the number eight spot,
it's Latrice Royale
in royal blue.
Ooh, now I love that dress.
I love the color of that blue
with the color of her skin.
And was living for
an asymmetrical silhouette.
- True, true goddess.
Voluptuous, beautiful.
I love that her eye shadow
matched the gown.
She wore it impeccably.
- I just can't believe
how beautiful
Michael Clarke Duncan
looks...gorgeous.
- He's done really well
for himself.
- He really has.
- Yes, he has.
At number seven,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
survivor of the RuPocalypse.
Very [indistinct].
- It was like<i> Waterworld</i>
meets, like,
<i>Xena: Warrior Princess.</i>
And I loved that when she
walked,
it was very much, like,
"I know I'm the shit.
It's cool."
- Bushmeat
never looked so good.
- [laughs]
- I live for the attitude,
the confidence, the silhouette.
It had a purpose.
And she executed it very well.
- You didn't think it was
a little too roadkill?
- It gave me beaver
on the side of the road.
But, you know,
who doesn't love a good beaver?
- That's true.
- Especially
on the side of the road.
- You're absolutely right.
Number six, Dida Ritz...
serving gold and gams.
Very Fritz Lang<i> Metropolis.</i>
- The Walmart version.
I wouldn't personally wear it,
because I'm not that cheeky.
With her skin tone,
gold is absolutely amazing.
Her having legs for days,
she can really pull off
a look like that.
- Coming in at number five,
Chad Michaels'
renaissance realness.
Lady Chatterley.
- Gorgeous,
the dog days are gone.
- I think she was Joan Of Arc
in her former life.
- [laughs]
At number four,
little Kenya Michaels
is pretty in pink.
Oh, look at her.
- If Nicki had a my size Barbie,
that would be her.
- [laughs]
- Definitely.
- She's so adorable.
She's just, like, a little doll.
I wanna pick her up
and squeeze her till she pees.
- [laughs]
- I still have to question if
everything is down there still.
She is true, true Walmart fish.
She really is.
- [laughs]
At number three,
it's Sharon Needles,
serving drastic plastic chic.
- What drag queen does not love
a good battery acid
chemical peel?
- I love the "Madonna two weeks
before the Super Bowl" look.
- [laughs]
- Sharon has such
an incredible ability
to me to take something so odd
and make it so chic
and ugly-beautiful.
- The number two fits in fashion
is Willam's tummy troubles.
- [vomiting]
- I say, "Bitch, that's what you
get for eating solid food."
- Agreed.
- It's obvious somebody still
has their gag reflex.
She's giving blonde trash
everywhere a bad name.
- [laughs]
- Tara Reid
would be proud though.
- Tara Reid would be proud.
- You're absolutely right
about that.
- And now, if I may, Ru,
the number one most sickening
fits and fashion belongs to--
oh, you know, it's not just one.
It's 11 timeless looks.
- I think I know
where this is going.
- And the winner is...
RuPaul!
Roll tape.
[growling]
Oops, uh-oh,
I think I just got fired.
Roll the other tape.
- Chanel,
which one of my outfits
was your favorite?
- I have to say with the
feathers--the blue feathers.
Like, May West had
a RuPaul drag baby.
- I, of course,
love absolutely all of them.
- Yes, that goes with saying.
- It's a toss-up between
the best little Ruhouse
in Texas look.
- Yes, yes.
- Or the very flowing, like,
Barbie meets Mrs. Roper look.
- Yes, yes, I love that.
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous, gorgeous.
I'm not gonna
leave you out, Mariah.
- I have to pick
the emerald green.
I wanted to
ease on down the road,
and snatch it right out
of your closet.
- Oh, my goodness.
I'd give it you, but I just
don't want to see it on eBay.
[laughter]
All right,
just between us girls,
who do you think should be
crowned
America's next drag superstar?
Chanel?
- Chad Michaels.
He's so seasoned.
And he's so professional.
And he's a perfectionist
in every single thing he does.
- Pandora?
- I would really love to see
Sharon Needles take the title.
Because I think
she's so different
than any of the previous winners
that she would really
just take it to a whole,
different, crazy, spooky level.
And I love it.
- Mariah?
- My pick has to be
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She's definitely hungry.
She has the fire.
The attitude is channeled
the right way.
She can just sear
right through the competition.
- Well, ladies,
you'll have to wait
just like everyone else
to find out
who's crowned America's
next drag superstar.
Now, before you go,
there's a little thank you gift
under your seat.
- [gasps]
Look it.
- It's<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Iron Fist shoes.
- It's a petite size 12,
just like me.
- I just want
to make love to it.
- I love that.
- Cute little kitten heel
to go play around in.
- [meows]
- Strap on some attitude, girls.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Next week,
it's attack of the Glamazons,
as Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and Sharon Needles
battle it out
for the title of America's
next drag superstar,
and walk away with a lifetime
supply of NYX cosmetics,
and a one of a kind trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut,
and a cash prize of $100,000
in the over-the-top extravaganza
that you won't want to miss.
The time has come for us to take
an up and close personal look
at the final three.
- Well, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- How are y'all doing?
- A Chicago showgirl,
Phi Phi O'Hara is a feisty
firecracker...
- Don't be jealous of my boogie.
With the will to win...
- I want to look like a hot
Miami piece of ass.
- You look like it to me.
- Good.
- Hungry and ambitious...
- You're damn right I'm hungry.
You all should be hungry.
- She always brings
her A game.
- If the final say-so happened
today, you would win.
- Oh, hell no!
- Phi phi fierce
ruled the wrestling ring.
[cheering]
- Now, I'm gonna show you how
to really beat a mug, bitch.
- And her fighting spirit
caused a few rumbles
in the workroom as well.
- At least I am
a showgirl, bitch.
Go back to Party City,
where you belong.
But Phi Phi also revealed
a softer side.
- I wish I had a dad
like him to accept me
for everything that I am.
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?
- Probably not.
And that's okay.
I'm fine with that.
I hope he values...
like, who I am.
I'm a good person.
- I really want you
to have my phone call.
I really wanted to win it
for you.
- Honey, thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi O'Hara has a magic
combination of talent,
beauty, and ambition.
But, is it enough
to take her to the very top?
- Morning, bitches.
- What's up?
- Hi, everybody.
- Let's turn back time
on Miss Chad Michaels.
A world-class Cher impersonator.
- Cher comes to her for tips.
- This is one of many natural
hair colors
that I'll be wearing tonight.
[laughter]
I'm Cher, bitch.
- Throughout the competition...
- You want some of this?
We got plenty for you too.
- This dark lady has proven...
- Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.
- That she's much more
than a gypsy.
- I am from California.
More specifically, the Shady
Acres Trailer Park on Doheny
between Weho and Beverly Hills.
- Tramp...
- What a jerk.
- And a thief.
- What made you think that
we could get away with
sneaking into a nut farm
in the middle of the night?
- Having accomplished
so much in her career,
will the next feather
in this half-breed's headdress
be the title of America's
next drag superstar?
[cheering]
- Sharon Needles arrived
as the freaky underdog.
- I look spooky,
but I'm really not.
- And her spooky-drag persona
set her apart from the start.
- Oh, she's bleeding.
- Goodness.
- Somebody call a dentist.
- She didn't hit off
with the other girls initially.
- I think a lot of the girls
here think I'm a one-trick pony.
You know, I'm just a spook,
monster girl.
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
- But Sharon soon won over the
judges with her edgy aesthetic.
- I didn't even get the name
right away.
- All in the past, Miss Cole.
- Okay?
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.
- All right, well, yes.
- But she was plagued
by nagging guilt
over her boyfriend back home.
- She's auditioned
all four years,
and then I try out one time
and, you know, here I am.
I feel guilty about it
all the time.
- But Sharon rose above
and kept on winning.
- Condragulations.
Condragulations.
Condragulations.
- Yes.
- You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
She showed the judges
that she could diversify
her dark-sided drag.
But always stayed true
to her own unique style.
- You look like you
came out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
- Ooh.
- From spooky to unspookable,
does Sharon Needles
have the fright stuff
to be America's
next drag superstar?
The top three girls,
the best of the best.
So which of these amazing queens
has the charisma,
uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
to be America's
next drag superstar?
Let's consult the stars.
Tell us what the future holds,
Madame Visage.
- Chad Michaels.
Chad Michaels is a Pisces,
and fish always do well
in this competition.
I predict Chad Michaels will be
America's next drag superstar.
- Oh, spoil alert.
Well, what's the story
for the others?
- Sharon Needles is a Leo
with Scorpio rising
and panties dropping.
I see it now.
Sharon Needles
will win this competition.
- Wait a minute,
I thought you said
Chad Michaels was gonna win.
- What, you--what?
You don't question
Madame Visage, girl.
Hold the celestial phone.
Phi Phi O'Hara
is a double-jointed Virgo.
As see it as clear
as a Lucite hooker-heel.
Phi Phi O'Hara is the winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Don't quit your day job,
Madame Visage.
What you say about my boob job?
- Well, what is crystal clear
is this competition
has never been so close.
And, with a cash prize
of $100,000,
next week's final challenge
promises to be the most
pressure-filled
and surprising
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>
You won't want to miss a moment.
Until next week...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- Amen.
- All right.
Let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Ladies, the password is...
<i>Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
I might not be the biggest
star here,
but I got the biggest
knockers, okay?
[guffaws]
- I just want to say to
Lady Gaga that I am the only
boss here.
- This was a real heavy
Diana Ross.
- [imitates fart]
- Oh, my goodness.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chickenshit gigs.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
[applause]
It's very important for you to
understand we're looking for
the top.
Bring your "A" game.
- I will.
- Milan, shante, you stay.
Kenya Michaels, sashay away.
[cheers and applause]
And tonight...
oh, oh, oh, oh.
The dolls get wet.
And wild.
Ohhh!
With extra-special guest judges
<i>NCIS</i><span style="bodyStyle"> star Pauley Perrette and</i>
Kelly Osbourne.
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX Cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy of
alandchuck.travel, headline
logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour featuring</i>
Absolut Vodka, cocktails
perfected, and a cash prize of
$100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- I'm getting the hangers.
- Oh.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning, and Kenya's not
here anymore, and it's sad,
'cause my best friend's gone.
- "Phi phi, I love you.
Sisters forever."
all: Aww.
- You sent both of
the Puerto Rican girls home.
- I know.
- You ain't never gonna be
in<i> West Side Story</i><span style="bodyStyle"> again.</i>
[laughter]
Not even a touring production,
bitch.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Uh-uh.
- Bye, Kenya. I love you.
Uh! This hurts.
- Things got emotional
on the runway last week.
Today we've had a little time,
you know, to heal up, refocus.
I'm so, so happy that I won
the<i> Snatch Game.</i>
It was almost overshadowed by
how sad we were,
and it was hard
for me to celebrate, but I did
celebrate yesterday.
[laughter]
- I'll be honest.
I felt like my drag was
misunderstood.
Like, I'm so across the board.
I like to teeter-totter in the
boy world.
- I think teeter-tottering in
the boy world works when you're
super feminine.
It's hard for a drag queen to
teeter-totter in the boy world
while still being that drag.
- I have always had to deal
with people's perception of what
drag is, but I have to remain
true to myself.
I'm not gonna compromise.
- We know that you are
an accomplished actor.
Now, were those tears real,
Willam?
- Those were real, yeah.
I can cry on cue, but I wouldn't
have cried ugly like that.
- She was acting.
That was not real.
This bitch is faking it.
- My lashes were falling off.
- I didn't know Satan could
cry.
[alarm wails]
all: Ooh.
Here we go.
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.
Greetings.
My name's RuPaul, and I'll be
your cruise director.
Come aboard.
We're expecting you...
to make waves.
Okay?
Big waves.
Holla!
'Cause sometimes to avoid being
stonewalled, a girl's got to
rock the boat.
all: What?
- I don't get it.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Good morning, Ru.
Hello, Ru.
- Now, you all have been working
so hard that I've decided to
give you a break.
A spring break.
[cheers and applause]
- Tramp stamps.
- Today's mini challenge is
your chance to soak in the sun
and let it all hang out
in an all-American wet T-shirt
contest.
- [howls]
[applause]
- Now, just outside is a thirsty
crowd of spring breakers.
Each of you needs to "wet" their
appetite, wearing a Glamazon
T-shirt and a pair of your new
bosom buddies...silicone
breastplates courtesy of
boobsforqueens.com.
And the queen that gets the
biggest reaction from the crowd
will win.
[cheers and applause]
Jelly.
- This is money in the bank.
I got this.
- You have 30 minutes to style
and stuff your T-shirts.
I'll see you outside.
Let's go.
- Boobs!
- Holy moly.
- Show me your tits.
- Playing girlyish and bouncy
and sexy is something really
foreign to me.
- What and what and where is
the body, baby?
- My look is, "God, I want to
"go to Miami, but I can only
afford Fort Lauderdale."
- Mama Chad looks like a MILF.
Chad, damn.
It's called Forever 21,
not Forever 41.
- Let's go to the beach.
[cheers and applause]
[whistle blows]
- Welcome to spring break at
Dragtona Beach.
[cheers and applause]
Are you ready to get wet
and wild?
First up, from The Big Apple,
London, Paris...Milan.
She's got two big apples.
Oh.
She not shy.
She is mopping the floor.
Chad Michaels.
Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.
- My tits are big, my hair is
big, and my ass looks good.
I'm just feeling like
a drag cougar.
- It's Jiggly Caliente.
Her milkshake brings all the
boys to the yard.
Touch all of this, Jiggly.
Sharon Needles.
[laughs]
- I'm not one of those
fishy queens.
I never want to create a
character that someone would
want to fuck.
I like to mock sexiness.
[exclamations]
- She's a regular Danny Thomas
with that spit take.
Phi Phi O'Hara!
Uh-oh.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.
- I was shaking my boobs, and
all of a sudden my boobs
came off.
- She's coming undone.
- And then they poured
the water,
and then all of a sudden,
my wig fell off,
and it was a mess.
- Phi Phi, do you have all your
body parts?
[laughter]
Willam, Hollywood honey.
Oh, squirt. Squirt it.
I hope that lotion's
waterproof.
- I feel amazing,
because I know I look great.
And I was serving 'em sex,
and I just soaked it up.
- Oh, my God, she's driving
the crowd crazy.
She's a dirty, dirty girl,
that Willam.
Everything tastes good on
a Dida Ritz.
She's soaking wet.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Chocolate milk.
Put your hands together for
Latrice Royale.
You need some cooling down,
girl.
Oh!
- You know my alter ego is
a stripper.
I'm loving every bit of it.
- Give it up for
Latrice Royale.
Thank you, Latrice.
You were all wet and wild.
Damn!
One of y'all really worked
the crowd into a lather.
Can I get a drumroll?
[drumroll]
The titular winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Willam.
- Yeah!
- Yes.
- I won; you know, it's kind of
a hobby of mine.
Thank you, God,
for all this bod.
- Condragulations, Willam.
Spring break 2012!
Now that spring break is over,
it's time for a little
herstory lesson.
Back in 1969, at the Stonewall
riots, it was a drag queen who
had the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent to dig her
heels in and start a revolution.
And every year since, drag
queens have been the shining
stars of pride celebrations
around the world.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be styling
a fashion-forward look for our
very own pride parade.
Now, the theme for this year's
pride is hope floats.
In addition to your outfits,
you'll need to design parade
floats using these colorful
accessories.
[laughter]
Ships ahoy.
Each of you will be assigned
a different boat based on the
eight colors of the original
rainbow flag.
Willam, you won the mini
challenge, so you get to assign
the color themes,
using these hankies.
- I want blue.
Indigo blue.
I think this is the fairest way
to do it.
- Jiggly gets orange.
Phi Phi gets violet.
Dida gets red.
Turquoise for Latrice.
Pink for Chad Michaels.
Yellow for Milan.
And green for Sharon needles.
Now, ladies, you can use your
own drag, plus materials
provided by Michael Levine
fabrics.
Your ensemble needs to be super
chic and take pride over the
rainbow and on to the runway.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Yay.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, look, shamrocks.
- This might buckle
my runway game.
- Your walk is your everything.
I don't know about that.
- Give it to me.
Give me Gautier
in a boat stripe.
- This is the ugliest color
ever.
- I love orange.
- It doesn't look good on me.
I went from baked potato to
sweet potato.
- Jiggly, what are you doing?
What is the concept of your
costume?
- As of right now,
I have no clue.
I'm not good at the creative
stuff.
This is the challenge where I
could sink to hell.
I want to incorporate this
somehow.
But then I just don't want it to
look like a Thanksgiving float.
And it's gonna look like
a turkey.
- Yeah, you don't want to look
like a turkey.
You don't want that to happen.
- Fuck, I'm screwed.
- Today our main challenge is,
we have to create
a Pride Parade float
with a matching outfit
in one of the colors
from the Pride flag.
- Originally, for the old
gay rainbow flag,
green stood for nature.
There's nothing natural
about me.
- You made a snake.
Are you doing a Garden of Eden
theme boat?
- Um, more like a Medusa.
Like, "Look at me, and I'll turn
you into Stonewall."
- Oh, yeah.
- So who here knows what
Stonewall is?
- Stonewall was in June of '69,
and the cops decided to go in
and cause some trouble.
- They were just, you know,
giving this one particular bar
all kinds of hell.
They just put their foot down.
They weren't gonna take it
anymore.
- I heard if you wore women's
clothing or makeup, they would
douse your head in the mop
buckets of nightclubs.
- Wow.
- You had to wear at least
three articles
of clothing that
were assigned to your genders
at all time,
or you could be arrested.
- I grew up in a religious
household, and that being gay
was just not something that
was accepted.
But this challenge does help me
rethink my perspective, because
it makes me very proud to know
that other queens have paved
the way.
- Chad, what was it like
to be there?
You were, what, 29 at the time?
[laughter]
- Okay.
I think for everybody to know
where we came from.
A legacy of drag deserves
to be carried on.
Me and Bob used to just
sit around for hours
and just glue sequins
onto dresses.
Bob's no stranger to a glue gun
in a pinch.
- That whole impersonating thing
you have to really do
your homework
to get every nuance,
ever characteristic.
- You do.
Celebrity impersonation
is my passion.
And it has been
from the beginning,
because when I started
in my show, the<i> Dreamgirls,</i>
it was all look-alikes
and all comedy,
and if you wanted to be
in the show,
you had to do
celebrity impersonations.
- Wow.
- I'm absolutely here
to be a role model.
This art doesn't have to die,
because it is dying.
There aren't very many people
like me anymore who do,
like, actual
"celebrity impersonation."
That's what I've done
for most of my career
is be a celebrity impersonator,
and I've loved it.
rock it out.
I've been, you know,
in the business a while.
I want to inspire the younger
generation of drag queens
to step up and do it right.
- [blowing]
[spits]
Fucking swallowed glitter.
- You've swallowed worse.
We're gonna have dinner soon.
Stop eating the glitter.
- Stupid-ass bitch.
- Goddamn it, Jiggly.
- Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.
I love my boat already.
I want to go on my boat so bad.
- You fucking cunt.
- [laughs]
I decide to do all-over pattern
of stars, or stickers, that have
my face on them.
The theme is hope floats, and
I've always hoped to be a star.
- That's you?
- Yes, it's me.
- You dirty bitch.
- Narcissistic much?
- Willam's boat was covered
in stickers of himself
and to me did not represent
Pride at all.
- How are you feeling
about this challenge?
- This is not something
that I normally do,
and I'm really--I'm trying
to focus on the boat first
and make sure I get
something down for that.
Trying to do what I can.
Sink or swim.
Sink or swim.
The most difficult thing
about the challenge for me is,
my brain goes in 20 million
different directions.
Sometimes being an artist
can be difficult.
- Here's your micro-dot, babe.
- Oh, shit.
I didn't realize that.
The clock was ticking,
and all I could think about was,
"Try to convey some type
of message on this float."
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- It looks like
a Kylie Minogue concert
exploded in here.
- [chuckles]
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Hello.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Yes, you may.
- Oh, good.
What we're looking for is
fashion-forward.
You know,
the theme is hope floats.
What statement are you going
to make?
- I--the statement I want to
make is that, um...
dreams are possible.
- Huh.
Now, what are your plans to
decorate your boat?
- Um, I plan on adding the
trimmings, the fabrics, and then
I'm gonna add the flowers and
other knickknacks.
- Yeah.
- Ru is not buying my bullshit
at this.
I know it.
I can see it in her eyes.
- I don't want to worry you,
but you do seem a little bit
behind.
We're looking for an expression
of Jiggly.
- Definitely.
- All right.
Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- How am I gonna do this?
- Dida Ritz.
- Hi, Ru.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm going for a '70s
really hippie vibe.
Very love, peace, and harmony.
And my whole concept
is a jumpsuit.
- With a blouse.
- Maybe with a blouse,
maybe not.
I don't know yet.
- We're looking to see the best
Dida that there is.
We want fashion-forward,
you know?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll see you out
on the parade route.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Good luck.
Hi, Chad.
- It's time for another edition
of Ru's Clues.
- [laughs]
What are you gonna do
to make sure that your boat
and your costume and everything
represents hope
and the future of gay pride?
- I really want it to be,
you know, cyber showgirl,
fashion-forward.
- Now, you're boat.
- My boat.
- You've got a lot
going on there.
You have netting around there.
- I have netting.
I'm capturing hearts and minds
with my net.
- Are you planning to edit
the boat at all?
- I feel like it's got
a really futuristic feel to it
with, you know--
- The metallic.
- The metallic and the square,
like,
faux sequin and all that.
- I can't wait to see it
on the runway.
- I'll be there.
- All right, Chad.
You get back to work,
Lady Chad-erly.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
- Well, well, well, Willam.
- It's starship Willam.
- Wow.
- In your book you had a quote
that said,
"Even when I was down,
"I treated myself as
a star.
And eventually, the rest of
the world would catch up."
And I wrote that on my little
binder in eighth grade.
I've adopted that theory too.
I've always treated myself like
a star and just knew it was
gonna happen.
- We got on your case last week
about being more vulnerable, and
that story's very vulnerable.
And what do you plan on wearing
if anything?
- Do you remember that episode
of<i> Sex and the City</i>
where Carrie
fell down on the runway?
- Yes.
- Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat.
Oh, well, look who's got it.
- Is that the exact one?
- It's not the one she wore.
- I see.
- Because, you know, she's so
much bigger than me.
- [laughs]
I'm gonna let you get back
to work here.
Bye.
London, Paris, Milan.
- Hi, Ru.
- So tell me about this boat.
- My inspiration for this,
honestly, I mean, we're doing a
future thing, but I wanted to
try to do a flashback
to the future.
- A flashback to the future.
- Yes.
- But we're asking you to be
fashion-forward.
Now, you live in New York city,
the most fashionable city...
- I do.
- In the U.S.
Where do your costumes
come from?
- Um, usually I have people
make them for me.
- I see.
- 'Cause a lot of my costumes
are characters,
like the housewife or that looks
like the lady next-door.
- You don't want the audience
to know who you are.
You want them to see
a character.
But we want to know who you are.
- No, I definitely want them to
know who I am.
- Because you have lip-synched
twice.
- I have.
- Make that Milan come out.
- Okay.
- Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are ya?
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.
So what are you working on?
- I have a one-armed catsuit
right now.
- Is that Uranus on...
- It is my-ranus.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- The theme is hope floats.
I want to know about your
darkest hour and how you were
able to get over that.
- Well, as a kid, I had--I grew
up in a really abusive, like,
household.
And it wasn't a very good
childhood.
And it took 16 years for us to
figure it out, but we did.
<i>It feels good to leave all that</i>
<i>stuff back there.</i>
<i>Chicago's a fresh start for me.</i>
<i>I get to live the life that</i>
<i>I want to live.</i>
- So you've come a long way,
baby.
You've pulled yourself up out
of some really dark places.
This is your chance to shine.
I'm counting on you to pull
through.
- Okay.
- Okay, you've done it before.
You can do it again.
- I will.
- All right. Get to work.
- Yes.
- All right.
At ease.
- All right, ladies,
gather round.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be celebrating Pride with
our extra-special guest judges,
fashionista and TV star, my good
pal Kelly Osbourne will be here.
- Oh, my God.
Yay.
[cheers and applause]
- I love Kelly Osbourne.
Even to even get read by her,
I don't care.
It's an honor.
She's sickening.
- And a woman who's no stranger
to the navy.
From<i> NCIS,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Pauley Perrette</i>
will be here.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
[applause]
- Wow.
- How many times did you work
with her, Willam?
- Just once, so fuck off.
[laughter]
- Now, ladies, remember...it
ain't the size of your boat but
the motion in your ocean, okay?
- Okay.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. All right.
- See you later.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Bye.
- Arts and crafts day.
- Our challenge today is to make
fabulous fashion-forward
outfits and gay pride floats.
So with challenge,
you have to have a crafty eye,
and you have to be creative with
your float and your costume.
This competition
is really gonna show
who can keep up
with the big girls.
Fucking shit.
Fuck.
- I did it all wrong.
Fuck.
- Oh, my God.
Now I just fucked it up.
- But that's pretty.
Girl, you're gonna win.
- You can kiss my ass.
- [laughs]
- Ugh.
It is very hard to create an
outfit from scratch in a day and
decorate a boat.
It's damn near impossible.
My God, this making a boat crap
is just--is not the type of
dress...
all righty.
- You okay?
- No.
- She doesn't know her idea
for her boat.
- You have a bunch of stuff over
there,
and you have a lot
of good stuff too.
Open stuff up.
Look at the textures.
Look at all that stuff
and just play with it.
Jiggly's just out of her element
being on this competition.
She is so far behind, and it's
just like, "Girl, just get your
crap done."
- The hardest part about this
challenge is not telling
everybody else that I'm gonna
win.
- Wow, that is really cool.
- Yeah, I mean, it looks
egotistical,
but it's got a message,
like, "I'm gonna handle myself
like I'm gonna be
somebody someday."
- You're sickening, bitch.
You're sickening.
- Sickening?
More like absolutely disgusting.
- Really?
- Yeah, bitch.
- Thank you.
- So has anybody ever done,
like, pride performances or
pride shows?
- Bitch, I put my gay pride
time in, honey.
In my years.
- In Pittsburgh, they don't
ask me ever to do Pride.
I mean, maybe they just think
my act is reserved
for nighttime only.
- Maybe it's because she's
a spooky bitch.
- I like spotlights,
not sunlight.
- What was it like for you guys
in your hometowns
growing up being gay?
- I'm from Texas, so Texas is
not about the whole
being gay thing.
I remember, when I first went
out to the gay clubs, there was
a lot of, like, gay bashing,
and, like, guys would come by
with, like, baseball bats.
Like, moving to Chicago, I can
hold someone's hand walking down
the street or I can be
affectionate.
And In Texas, you can't do that.
- Damn.
- It's kind of hard
for me to talk about it.
I don't really like
where I come from.
I don't--it is not
a lot of good memories.
I was teased a lot
when I was young.
I hate talking about it,
'cause it makes me just pissed.
Like, the people that called me
a fat girl,
some of them still work--
no shade--
but still work at McDonald's,
still work at Burger King,
still living at home
with their parents,
ain't got a life.
Home is not a good memory
for me.
- Theresa,
I knew you grew up in Compton.
- Ugh.
- What was that like?
- You don't even think about
saying the world "gay"
or that you're gay.
It's straight-up hood there.
You know what I mean?
So I was threatened
and beat up and told
if I was ever--turned out gay,
I would get killed,
and it was rough.
So I just kept all that
to myself
until I was big enough
and bold enough
and grown enough to move.
And so I did, you know,
and...
- Is the New York drag
community all in Manhattan?
- The New York drag community
is sort of everywhere.
Definitely certain areas where
there's certain drags
you can see.
There's the singing girls,
there's the campy girls, there's
the grunge girls...
- So what are you?
Like, what's your...
- I'm a floater.
My style kind of bounces around.
<i>I don't want to be pigeonholed</i>
<i>as just a drag "queen."</i>
I think it's important for
people to see that there is
an artist on stage.
- I have dignity looks and
paycheck looks.
Dignity is when I will not bend
for anyone, and I don't care if
I make a dollar.
I'm doing what I'm doing.
- Right.
- And there's times the
electric's about to shut off,
so I dress up like Lady Gaga.
- Right.
[laughter]
- Jiggly, is that a men's shirt
or a women's shirt?
Your hanger strap is showing,
and I already know the answer.
- No, it's not.
- You cross-dresser!
We're supposed to be boys today,
and you're cross-dressing.
- Really, girl? Really?
Her slick-ass comments are gonna
drive me crazy.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
- Ugly bitch.
- You shut your ugly boat
mouth.
- Oh, you have something to
say, bitch?
- Yeah, your boat's ugly.
- You narcissistic whore.
- Your boat's ugly.
- I don't care.
My boat could be ugly, bitch.
- But your face is ugly.
- Your boat don't float.
Your boat don't float.
- Come here and say that,
bitch, 'cause I will inject this
shit right in your cheeks,
ho.
- Ohh, don't talk to me like
Chad Michaels.
You know how passionate he is
about silicone work.
- [as Cher]
Shut up, stupid.
Willam runs his mouth a lot.
It's kind of like a spigot you
can't turn off.
And it started to get on my
nerves.
I'm Cher, bitch.
- You guys, you know what my
boat reminds me of?
- What?
- A winner.
[laughter]
- Selfish bitch,
learn your words.
You will be in the bottom two.
- Bitch.
[alarm goes off]
- Anchors aweigh, bitches.
- Cluck-cluck, ladies.
- So much to do.
- Let's get to work.
- I was having panic attacks
about this damn snake.
- The mood in the workroom
right now is intense.
Queens are hustling,
people gluing, going crazy.
It's insane right now
in the workroom.
- Does this look like a fucking
anchor yet?
I ended up with the final
concept for my boat last minute.
Now I just got to finish it.
Sharon?
- Yeah?
- Does this look like an anchor?
- It kind of looks like
a dick.
- It does look like a penis.
- What's the theme of your
boat?
- The whole, "It gets better,
love you for you,"
very Saint-Tropez.
Bright colors.
Very Saint-Tropez.
So I'm just, like,
scrambling for time.
- Jiggly's is still a mess.
She kept adding crap upon crap
on top of more crap, so it just
looked like a big pile of crap.
- I'm just gonna try to go for
obvious things--sunlight,
yellow, you know, happiness.
- Right.
- I'm gonna get a little grade
school at moments.
- There ain't gonna be nothing
about grade school on my boat.
My boat's gonna be an all-adult
function.
- If I would have made Milan's
boat, I wouldn't have put<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on it.</i>
I would have blamed it on
someone else.
Like, "I didn't do this boat.
No, this is her boat.
That girl's boat, not my boat."
- I'm looking around the room,
and I'm in drag, everybody else
is practically done and in drag,
and Jiggly's still stapling and
gluing stuff to her float, and
I'm like, "Hello, you only have,
"like, minutes left until you've
got to be in drag and on that
runway."
- It's sink or swim.
You better be ready,
and you better care.
- Jiggly is a hot mess.
Good luck, girl.
- Oh, shit.
Where the fuck are my tits?
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, guys.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.
- Michelle Visage, are you
proud of our girls?
- I am proud to be an American,
and I am proud of our girls.
- [laughs]
Billy B., are you ready to see
our girls?
- I am so ready.
- Kelly Osbourne.
- Hi, Ru.
- You've been grand marshal
of Gay Pride here in
Los Angeles.
- Yes, with my mama.
- Well, you'll feel right at
home here.
- I already do.
- Pauley Perrette,
welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
Happy to be here.
- I love a parade.
Don't you?
- Yes.
- This week our queens were
challenged to design Pride
floats.
Now they're ready to parade
them down the runway.
Are you ready to see their true
colors?
- Hell, yeah.
- Gentlemen, start your
engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Chad Michaels. Ahoy.
- Glamorous.
- She's showboating.
- My outfit is fashion-forward
showgirl--always beautiful,
always painted, nearly naked.
- Starbooty!
- She's serving the deadliest
catch...
- Snapper.
- Dida Ritz in red.
Oh, I love a harem pant.
- I'm serving float
coutureness.
I'm not letting this boat get
in my way.
I always leave my mark.
Honey, I pee on the runway.
Trust.
- Red sky at night,
sailors' delight.
Nice aft.
Up next, Jiggly Caliente in my
favorite color, orange.
- Tangerine dream.
- Yes.
- I look good.
My wrap is flowing.
My hair's flowing.
My makeup is right.
My lips look right.
I look sickening, bitch.
- Mm, it reminds me of
Orange Julius.
Or is it Lrange Jiggly-us.
Milan.
- Hello, sunshine.
- I'm feeling proud of what
I created.
My float is<i> The Milan Invasion.</i>
It's inspired by Fire Island.
- Boatload of wigs.
- It's nice to have extra wigs,
though.
- It is, 'cause, if you end up
on<i> Gilligan's Island</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and you</i>
want to do shows, well...
- Hello.
- Yeah.
- Ooh, Sharon Needles.
- She is from the
Garden of Eden.
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?
- I was really serving them
some snake realness.
I can strike at any time.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I love!
- Latrice Royale in turquoise.
- The goddess of the sea.
- Wow.
Look at all that water.
- I just want it all to hang
out today.
I have this hair that I baked
and sculpted and hand-painted.
- Love those lips.
- She fell face-first at
Claire's.
- [laughs]
- Now that is a Poseidon
adventure.
- Willam.
Oh, dear.
She's a low rider.
- Check that out.
- Dropping anchor.
Land ho.
- Oh, my God.
Permission to come aboard.
- Ooh, girl, I'm dusted.
- My costume's right,
my body's right.
This challenge is right up my
lagoon.
- She's showing us her
starboard side.
Stick it in the porthole,
Willam.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Like a float warrior.
- Ooh, love is a battleship.
- My look I'm channeling is
fashion-forward sci-fi.
I'm trying to give them
a bad-ass bitch.
- It's the Phi-Phi-tanic.
- She's going down with
the ship.
- Love it.
- Purple for passion.
My colorful queens,
I love a parade.
But now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Chad Michaels.
And what does your float say
about you?
- Obviously, with the stripes
on my costume
and the stripes on my boat,
I'm a drag cougar.
- [laughs]
- Rrargh.
I basically wanted to go with
classic showgirl,
but fashion-forward.
- Can you turn around so I can
see your butt, please?
That's my favorite part of your
whole costume.
I love it.
- Thank you.
- To me, it is traditionally
showgirl.
There's not something so fresh
and modern about it.
- Next up, Dida Ritz.
Wow, and your hair is all big
and everything.
- Take a little bit of advice
and put it to use.
- You have the cutest face.
So adorable.
- You do have a pretty face.
Sometimes I think that you might
rely on it too much.
What you have on,
it's not particularly an event.
You always seem sort of
pedestrian.
- Your boat, it looks a little
bit piñata-like.
You know, you want more.
It is a parade.
- Jiggly Caliente.
Tell us about your float.
- Right now, there's a lot of
gay youth being bulled.
I decided to use "Love you for
you."
I wanted to class it up a bit,
make it very Saint-Tropez.
'cause my outfit is really
a swimsuit.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yeah.
- Very Saint-Tropez.
- I'm really happy you took
your cape off.
I was dying to see what was
underneath there,
and it's adorable.
- It's the big reveal.
- You should have walked
the runway without the cape.
The boat, you said you wanted to
give it some class.
It's, like, sixth-grade class.
- Ugh.
- Next up, London, Paris,
Milan.
- Basically I wanted to
represent the history
of the
drag performance invasion on
Fire Island with the girls who
have long passed who have paved
the way for me to go forward in
the future.
And I named it<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion,</i>
because it's me,
and I'm invading the world.
- I know all about Fire Island.
The thing is, the boat didn't
really read that.
It was hard to understand.
- You know, everyone else sort
of had a real message about
pride, and the biggest thing
about your boat is that you made
it about you.
It sort of offended me.
- Sharon Needles.
You've got a little snake story
line going on there, don't you?
- The original green color in
the rainbow flag stood for
nature.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause all gays were hippies
in the '70s.
[laughter]
I used the snake because they're
feared for the wrong reasons.
And I've always been feared for
the wrong reasons.
- I'm so into your hand snake.
- My hand works great on
a snake.
- I think you look beautiful.
Your boat on the other hand
looks like it sank a few years
ago and it's covered in moss.
It sort of lost boat to me.
It just became this big green
thing.
- All right, next up,
Latrice Royale.
Lady turqu-ahh.
- I love anything that
sparkles, and you sparkle from
head to toe, and I love it.
- My lips are gonna crack.
- Tonight you're giving us
Nefertiti meets Ursula
the sea witch.
- Yes!
- I'm gonna challenge you on
one thing, Latrice.
- Tell me.
- The boots.
- [sighs]
- Girl, we seen 'em quite a bit
now.
- Are you saying those boots
weren't made for boating?
[laughter]
- You really are an event.
It's a beautiful, simple boat,
and it has a chicness that you
always seem to have.
It's a good job.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Willam.
- I'm giving you maritime
realness with the starship
Willam.
[laughter]
Amenities include Wi-Fi.
There's a party deck and
a business center.
[laughter]
- Why is Pride important?
- I got married in California
when it was legal, and then now,
all of a sudden, it's not.
Prop 8 got my ass down hard.
So I love that I got to do
a Pride challenge, and this is
Dolce &amp; Gabbana, so I love it.
- So the coat is Dolce, and
the swimsuit is Gaultier.
It's chic, it's fashionable,
it's modern.
The boat looks like it was
professionally done even.
You give very good mast-head.
[laughter]
- And P.S.,
fuck you for
having the most amazing body
ever.
[laughter]
- Thank you, house of Willam.
All right, up next,
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I just thought purple warrior
princess when you came out.
- I love your boat a lot.
I love the way you coordinated
the outfit with the boat.
And your makeup--you're on
the right track.
- I think you're like a
long-lost Kardashian sister.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- My one critique is just watch
out for your body shape still.
Right, if you're gonna be wide
there, then you got to give us
more hips, so just pay attention
to it, but you look stunning
tonight, baby.
Keep this up.
- Okay. I will.
- All right, ladies, I think
we've heard enough.
Now, while you untuck in
the interior illusions lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Now, just between us girls,
what do you think?
Latrice Royale.
- Latrice, I think,
is the real deal.
The boat was very chic...
- The makeup was truly artwork.
Those friggin' boots.
- Oh, my God, they're like
Goth lesbian hiking boots.
I will burn them.
- All right, let's move on.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Before, I had a problem with
the makeup every single time.
Today was the best that it's
been.
- She is listening, and I think
the more we critique her,
the more she'll get it.
- On down the line we go to
Jiggly.
- I would have loved all of it
had she taken her cape off.
It looked like a tent.
- It almost looked like she was
walking in a straitjacket.
- It's because she could barely
fit in the boat.
- How very dare you?
- What?
- Big is beautiful.
- Love Jiggly.
Tonight it was an epic fail.
- Chad Michaels,
the pink cougar.
- Chad can do no wrong, but,
see, now I'm starting to have
a problem with that.
I want to see Chad be human
and not robotic.
- I have to agree with you.
I would like to see her a little
bit more messy.
- Sharon Needles.
- My mother's maiden name.
- Your mother's maiden name is
Needles?
- Sharon Needles.
- [laughs]
- I loved her whole snake
thing.
- She's very H.R. Pufnstuf.
[laughter]
- I love the fact that she,
like,
she didn't have perfect hair.
It was a bit messy.
All the stuff that we don't like
about Sharon Needles we love
about Chad, and all the stuff we
don't like about Chad we love
about Sharon Needles, so they
need to kind of, like, take tips
from each other.
- All right, Milan.
- I think she thinks she's
more real than she really is.
- Like, she don't need padding.
- Exactly.
- And her body language is
totally "dude in a dress."
- If she lip-synchs tonight and
that wig comes off,
stop it already.
- Right.
- All right, all right, Willam.
- Does anyone really look like
that?
My God.
- How dare they have better
legs than me!
How very dare they!
- Now, Billy, you really liked
the design of the float.
- It was so well done.
It wasn't as vulgar as Milan 's
was.
- The fact that she got out of
it and then made a performance
out of it was also very
entertaining as well.
- Dida Ritz.
- The outfit was very
pedestrian, very mall-like.
- If Dida didn't wear a T-shirt,
I would be saying something
completely different.
- Right.
- Does she deserve to be in the
bottom two
because of the T-shirt?
- Yeah!
- A T-shirt is half your outfit.
- She was the only one up there
with a camel toe.
- Hello!
- Very hot.
- I didn't go there.
[laughter]
- You always have to go there,
darling.
Especially when they're tucking.
[laughter]
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
It was the late, great drag
queen and civil rights pioneer
Marsha P. Johnson who fought
back when the police raided
Stonewall.
To honor her legacy, it's up to
you to keep on breaking through.
Based on your pride-filled
presentations, I've made some
decisions.
Chad Michaels, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale...
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sharon Needles...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Willam, you navigated this
challenge beautifully, and we
were swept away.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
You will receive a cruise,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
- I'm okay with that.
- [laughs]
- It feels correct to win.
When it's right, it's right.
Yes, girl!
- Phi Phi O'Hara...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jiggly Caliente...
your message was uplifting,
but your float left us with
a sinking feeling.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Fuck.
I cannot go this far and get
sent home.
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Dida Ritz, you're just
finding your sea legs, but has
the ship already sailed?
Milan, you set a course for
fabulous, but your message got
lost at sea.
Dida Ritz...
I'm throwing you a lifeline.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>- Ugh, I'm in the bottom again.</i>
<i>But when it's time for me to</i>
<i>bring it, I want to bring it.</i>
<i>Because it's a competition and</i>
<i>I'm here to win.</i>
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- It doesn't matter if you
love him or capital H-I-M.
- I'm feeling ferocious.
I'm ready to attack.
I'm giving them 110%.
- Jiggly is working it.
She is feeling herself down.
She's trying to save her ass
right now.
[judges cheer]
- Milan, girl.
That's clearly a dude.
- Baby, you were born this way.
- You were born--you were born
this way.
- Yeah!
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Jiggly Caliente...
Shante, you stay.
Jiggly, you may join the other
girls.
- Thank you.
- London, Paris, Milan,
the world is calling.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
It was my moment to stop, and so
now I take on the next journey.
Have fun.
Realize that your purpose here
is to be an ambassador, to teach
a message of hope and love,
and every now and then, be the
bitch out of the competition.
- My lucky seven.
Don't be a drag.
Just be a queen.
And, remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, now let the music
play.
[upbeat music]

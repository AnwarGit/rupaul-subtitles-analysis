   hot dog actually stands in

    a metaphor, if you will,

          last season.

263

322
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,550

     You don't have to worry    
  about mention that last name,

349
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,296
             because            
     I always have problem.

350
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:05,897
    The only thing is, like,

    when we have a little bit   
         of interaction

             - Yeah.

353

354
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,169
            It's just           
       only body language.

355
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,436

00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,850
      All right, pens down.

379
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,618
       Okay, Denis O'Hare.

380
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,186
        - It takes place        
           in her wig.

381
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,154
     - In Lady Bunny's wig.     
      That's a good answer.

382
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:22,424
  Let's go to the stars and see 
  if you get any matches, okay?

383
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,925
       - Oh, I feel good.

384
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:24,692
        - Liza Minnelli.

385
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:28,696
            - I said            
      Lady Bunny's palace.

386
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:29,396
          - Her palace?

387
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:33,333
    - Because there's nothing   
    like playing the Palace.

388
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,167
           [all laugh]

389
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,601
     Mama played the Palace

390
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,769
            and I sat           
    right in the fourth row.

391
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,904
              -Wow.             
     -She sang right to me.

392
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,273
      And to all the other      
          homosexuals.

393
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,607
           [all laugh]

394
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,312
 - All right, let's move on down
  to superstar Alyssa Edwards.

395
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,047
          What say you?

396
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,482
        - I wrote snatch.

397
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,083
        - In her snatch.

398
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:55,117
     Not a match for Denis.

399
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,852
          - Did I lose          
        the Q&A portion?

400
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,954
        - No, you didn't.       
            [laughs]

401
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,722
   All right, Jasmine Masters.

402
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,423
             The new            
     "American Horror Story"

403
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,124
         is going to be         
      the scariest one yet.

404
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:07,026
       It all takes place       
       in Lady Bunny's...

405
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:08,727
         - American who?

406
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,930
       If it's not on BET,      
    I don't know what it is.

407
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:12,964
           [all laugh]

408
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:16,500
    - So if it's not on BET,    
       you don't watch it?

409
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:17,968
        - Hell to the no.

410
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,868
         - Oh. [laughs]

411
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,670
     Amanda Lepore, the new     
     "American Horror Story"

412
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:23,505
         is going to be         
      the scariest one yet.

413
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,007
       It all takes place       
       in Lady Bunny's...

414
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,042
    - Plastic surgery office.

415
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,010
           She clearly          
      isn't going to mine.

416
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:32,645
   - Oh, my God. Can you move   
        your face at all?

417
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:35,347
   - I'm moving it right now.

418
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,481
           - [laughs]

419
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:40,084
     - So let's move on down    
       to Naomi Campbell.

420
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,119
   I see you have a cell phone  
          right there.

421
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,620
    - When I got here to set,

422
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,021
            your crew           
      confiscated my phone,

423
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,155
          but luckily,          
    my good friend back here

424
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:48,323
      had a little prepaid      
          Cricket phone

425
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:51,793
     that she let me borrow     
       for the afternoon.

426
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,027
           Chris Rock,          
        thank you so much

427
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,795
      for letting me borrow     
           your phone.

428
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:55,862
           - Oh, dang!

429
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,197
        - I thought about       
  Tyra Bank's modeling career,

430
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,365
   so I just said the toilet.

431
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,666
           - [laughs]

432
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:04,635
    All right. Gigi Gorgeous,   
        what do you have?

433
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,970
         - I think that         
    it's gonna be her fridge.

434
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:11,274
  I highly doubt that she eats  
   organic, gluten-free food,

435
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,842
           and I would          
        just be terrified

436
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:14,944
           to open up           
      the refrigerator, Ru.

437
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,046
       - It's not a match.

438
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,447
  Now, Candis, you're up next.

439
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,948
         - Okay, hit it.

440
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,216
       - I just found out       
         my cat is gay.

441
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:27,320
      Last night, he didn't     
      cough up a fur ball.

442
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:30,022
     He coughed up a blank.

443
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,357
      Pens down, everybody.

444
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,324
       Okay, Candis Cayne.

445
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:36,827
       - My cat is so gay,      
   a purse fell out his mouth.

446
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:39,062
   - That is one gay pussycat.

447
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:41,397
              Okay.             
        Marlene Dietrich?

448
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,297
   - As a point of principle,

449
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,668
     I make sure that every     
  homosexual pussy that I meet

450
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,303
       receives a Marlene       
       signed photograph.

451
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,638
     - Not a match, Candis,     
           I'm afraid.

452
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,273
       - I'd love to give       
      Fraulein Candis Cayne

453
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,507
      a signed photograph.

454
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,108
            I promise           
     that Teutonic bisexuals

455
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,545
     make the most forceful     
    and unforgettable lovers.

456
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,979
           [all laugh]

457
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,447
 - All right. Let's move on down
        to Ms. Colombia--

458
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,383
  Well, actually, Ms. Colombia, 
    did you write an answer?

459
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:11,120
   - I can never win anything.

460
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,788
           - [laughs]

461
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,624
            -[cries]            
  -She's not gonna get very far

462
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:18,393
        in this business        
         like that, Ru.

463
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,061
           [all laugh]

464
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,862
      - Gigi Gorgeous, what     
    did you write down, girl?

465
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:26,499
  - He coughed up an Anastasia  
    Beverly Hills lip gloss.

466
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:29,601
           - Oh, okay.

467
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,970
       Well, not a match,       
         unfortunately.

468
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:33,738
        Jasmine Masters.

469
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,741
      Jasmine, what season      
     were you on<i> Drag Race?</i>

470
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,909
        - Does it matter?

471
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,509
           Did I win?

472
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,177
           - [laughs]           
       All right, Jasmine.

473
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,212
       Do you have a match      
           for Candis?

474
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:46,181
      - I don't own a cat.      
        They sense evil.

475
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:48,917
         - Oh. [laughs]

476
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,719
  All right, this is a question 
        for Denis O'Hare.

477
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,656
        Snapchat filters        
    are getting so inventive.

478
00:18:55,658 --> 00:19:01,762
 Now instead of swapping faces, 
       you can swap blank.

479
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,930
      - You can swap wives.

480
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,131
          - Swap wives!

481
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,334
         Sofia Vergara,         
          what say you?

482
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,034
        - You know what?

483
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,836
  I think it's related to what  
    are you looking to swap.

484
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,304
    So maybe I said titties.

485
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:18,175
  They help me to be successful 
 in this entertainment business.

486
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:20,944
      It's part of the why,     
            you know.

487
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:23,546
  - Girl, where are the jokes?

488
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,548
      Where are the jokes?

489
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,549
         Sofia is funny.

490
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,451
           [whispers]           
      Where are the jokes?

491
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,152
           - Let's go           
      to Marlene Dietrich.

492
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,254
  - Well, I found this question 
         kind of unfair

493
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,057
      because, as you know,     
 I rarely know these new things.

494
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,325
    I rarely leave my house.

495
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:39,892
              - No.

496
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,193
          - And I died          
        many decades ago.

497
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:43,762
    - You did. This is going    
  somewhere, I can tell, yeah.

498
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:47,732
 - So I wrote (speaking German) 
         and sauerkraut.

499
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:51,669
      - That's not a match,     
  but a very, very good answer

500
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,405
      and a long way to go      
         for an answer.

501
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:55,372
           I love it.

502
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:58,041
     All right, let's rewind    
        down to the ATL.

503
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,243
  NeNe Leakes is in the house.

504
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:03,179
   Instead of swapping faces,   
       you can swap what?

505
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,446
   - If I was gonna do an app

       I wanted to really       
      get to know the girls

   before I came out to them.

   to really sort out gender.

   And at a really early age,

571
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,055
           I was able           
      to latch on to drag,

572
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:02,492

    to express my femininity.

           to realize

    that all the drag things    
      that I wanted to do,

576
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:07,762
       it always led back

577

     that I'm a transwoman.

       I love the sequin.

00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,802
         I'm breathless.

   my favorite Madonna video.

00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:17,450
    This gorgeous woman being   
  surrounded by all these guys.

      she stole that look.

650
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:30,860
   - This is the second wife,

 the one that gets all the money
 and the diamonds and the furs.

    powerful bitch right now.

       without the pants.

660
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,881

   when you have all this ass?

    I've met this one before.

      -Hmm, we'll find out.

    to serve a black version    
           of Madonna,

     just seen this outfit.

          Sasha Velour.

 and she will be your mistress.

    the type of Madonna look

672
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,740
        that inspired me        
          and my style.

673
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:31,640

         with this look,

00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:24,316
    it was so controversial.

And showing this much of my body
     is controversial, too.

       anywhere with her.

     this other side of you.

     the big circle nipples.

        what that means.

744
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:21,512
      And in "Snatch Game,"     
             for me,

745
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:24,581
    it was like Jessica Lange   
         in "Freakshow"

       just extraordinary.

             Brava.

    such a great job with it.

         - I love Gigi.         
          I know Gigi.

753
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,827
         And I feel like        
    you could have pushed it,

754
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,094
      made it more comedic.

755
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,795
        - I thought maybe       
         you were gonna

756
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,731
throw a bunch of makeup products
       over your shoulder.

757
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,199
             I think            
     you only did that once.

758
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:47,832
       - For some reason,

759
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,200
       I thought there was      
     gonna be more questions

760
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:52,269
   and I'd have opportunities   
           to do more.

761
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,370
       - See, that's what       
       young people think.

762
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:54,904
      You see, when you get     
     to be my age, you know,

763
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:59,275
   you get one chance, sonny,   
        and you take it.

764
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:04,913
   Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown  
         Bader Ginsberg.

765
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:06,180
           [all laugh]

766
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:07,548
  - I so would have loved this

767
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,551
    if I didn't see Trinity's   
      version of this look.

768
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:13,287
           You get it.          
    It's just a heightened...

769
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,022
  -Yeah, it was more tailored.  
            -Exactly.

770
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:17,524
          - But I loved         
      your Jasmine Masters.

771
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:18,958
     The voice was spot on.

772
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,192
        - Hell to the no.

773
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,826
          - You played          
       by your own rules.

774
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:22,760
        You didn't answer       
          the questions

775
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:23,927
     the way they were meant    
         to be answered.

776
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,962
    You answered them the way   
   you wanted to answer them.

777
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,630
   I thought that was really,   
          really cool.

778
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,064
          - Thank you.

779
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:31,800
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

780
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:32,600
             - Hola!

781
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:36,403
            - I love            
    good boy-drag-drag-girl.

782
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:37,003
          - Thank you.

783
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:39,905
   - But something's going on   
     with your makeup, mija.

784
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:42,440
      I see too much brown      
            going on.

785
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,008
     It's almost a mustache.

786
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,110
       - I love the choice      
    of Sofia Vergara for you,

787
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,512
     but I didn't understand    
       what was going on.

788
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:49,412
    And it wasn't the accent.

789
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,848
    - I literally don't think   
   there was one joke in that.

790
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,683
           And you had          
       a regular dress on.

791
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:58,420
     Sofia Vergara has tits     
   that are bigger than mine.

792
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:01,556
      - Thank you, ladies.

793
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:02,990
   I think we've heard enough.

794
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:05,659
    While you take a holiday,

795
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:08,194
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

796
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:12,965
        Now, just between       
     us material squirrels,

797
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:13,932
       what do you think?

798
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,700
        Let's start with        
        Alexis Michelle.

799
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,235
    - Last week was the mall.   
     This week was couture.

800
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:21,871
 - And in "Snatch Game," she was
 witty, but in character witty.

801
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,007
      She wasn't making fun     
        of the character.

802
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,575
          She was being         
         the character.

803
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,209
      For me, it's a tossup     
           between her

804
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,843
      and Marlene Dietrich.

805
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,545
       - But her Liza was       
    the best characterization

806
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:35,282
and the thing that I'll remember
    about this "Snatch Game"

807
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:36,783
    more than anything else.

808
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:37,416
          - Peppermint.

809
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,217
    - Tonight on the runway,    
    I felt like it was, like,

810
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:40,785
          more Marilyn          
      than it was Madonna.

811
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,853
        And her character       
      in the "Snatch Game"

812
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:44,354
             for me             
      was one of the worst.

813
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,122
    If she didn't say bloop,

814
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:47,523
      I wouldn't have known     
       it was NeNe Leakes.

815
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:49,758
         - In fairness,         
       I said bloop first,

816
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,892
      and then she said it.

817
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:53,160
   - But it happens to people

818
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:55,162
       when they're acting      
           sometimes.

819
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:56,029
     They get in their head.

820
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:59,432
      - But I'm not getting     
  what I know she can deliver.

821
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:00,299
         - Sasha Velour.

822
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:01,600
     - Tonight on the runway    
        was a 10 for me.

823
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:05,437
  - And even with the whip, it  
made a link to Marlene Dietrich.

824
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,137
      - Yes, that's right.

825
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:09,073
        - It is not easy        
   to deliver Marlene Dietrich

826
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:12,910
   and have it be interesting   
     to this time and place.

827
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:16,647
    - What I love about Sasha   
      is she knows her lane

828
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:18,181
   and she never lets me down.

829
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:19,215
         Sasha's got me.

830
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:19,848
         - Farrah Moan.

831
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,051
       - I just feel like       
     she knew who Gigi was,

832
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:23,785
       but didn't know how

833
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,587
      to get anything more      
      than "hi" out of her.

834
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:30,724
      - I think she thought     
 that by choosing Gigi Gorgeous,

835
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:31,558
    it would gain her points

836
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,928
         in the sort of         
    underground cool factor,

837
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,062
         which it does.         
             - Yes.

838
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:39,131
    - But it didn't give her    
   enough options as a player.

839
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,266
       - Isn't it ironic,       
  the cool ones ended up being

840
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:44,135
        Marlene Dietrich        
       and Liza Minnelli,

841
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:45,002
          and the kids          
        don't even know.

842
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,870
             -Right.            
 -But I thought her Madonna look

843
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:49,839
  was maybe the most intricate  
         of everybody's.

844
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:50,940
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown.

845
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:51,907
  - We've been waiting for her

846
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:54,376
   to stop with the boo-hooing  
         and step it up,

847
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:56,344
           and I think          
       as Jasmine Masters,

848
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:59,046
    it was a big step forward   
        for Nina Bo'nina.

849
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:01,415
   - Denis, a little backstory  
       for you and Candis.

850
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,550
         Nina comes from        
     the Atlanta drag scene,

851
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:05,985
         who have never         
      really accepted her.

852
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:06,685
      So when she got here,

853
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:10,488
     she felt some kind of a    
 conspiracy theory against her.

854
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,324
 - I think it's kind of amazing 
         in a meta theme

855
00:34:13,326 --> 00:34:16,994
 that she chose Jasmine Masters 
   to express her discontent.

856
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,395
              -Yes.             
    -Because Jasmine Masters

857
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:21,131
       is the poster child      
         for discontent.

858
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,765
            -[laughs]           
      -But that being said,

859
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,801
     I saw a very confident,    
    fully realized character.

860
00:34:25,803 --> 00:34:30,138
      - But on the runway,      
      uh, no, not so good.

861
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,638
            - Uh-oh.

862
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,739
     - One thing I will say     
          as a sidebar,

863
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:34,875
 I don't like when these queens 
        do other queens.

864
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:35,408
             - Yeah.

865
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,176
       - Like, I feel like      
     it's an easy way to go.

866
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:38,210
      - I'm with Michelle.

867
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,345
        I feel like when        
   you're doing "Snatch Game,"

868
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,947
      it's somebody that's      
     beyond your knowledge.

869
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,950
       - Okay. We've come       
 to that portion in our program

870
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:50,554
   where we have to talk about  
    the elephant in the room.

871
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,188
      - Oh, I'm on a diet.

872
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,455
           [all laugh]

873
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:54,456
           - Not you.

874
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:58,960
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine      
        as Sofia Vergara.

875
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:00,494
       - It was this mess,

876
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:03,430
   this just nonsensical mess.

877
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:07,467
- And she's got a Spanish accent
    and it didn't even work.

878
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:08,367
      How does that happen?

879
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:10,268
    - Perhaps she's too close   
        to the character.

880
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,637
      If she went somewhere     
      very, very different,

881
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,871
       she might have had       
        a better effect.

882
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:16,440
      - Think of Yara Sofia     
        as Amy Winehouse.

883
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:17,541
              -Yes.             
          -We all died.

884
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:20,577
      - Exactly. She should     
    have played Maggie Smith.

885
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,045
           [all laugh]

886
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:23,046
     - It's not good enough.

887
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:24,380
     She got a second chance    
          to come back.

888
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:26,281
   She should be twice as good

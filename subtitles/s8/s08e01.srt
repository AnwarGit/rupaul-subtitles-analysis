00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,500
What are you doing?

705
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,567
So, do you remember
the Givenchy collection

706
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:55,867
with like, the big fur?

707
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,066
-Yes.
-It's inspired by that.

708
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,400
I want to find a way to, like,
celebrate this beige color.

709
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,834
Oh, God,
how can you celebrate that?

710
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,066
This material is going to be
challenging to work with,

711
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:07,333
<i>especially because</i>
<i>everything I have</i>

712
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,700
is a Florence Henderson
shade of poop brown.

713
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,533
There's so much stuff that I'm
trying not to get overwhelmed

714
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,533
and like, I got this and this
and this and this and this.

715
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,066
I don't do drag on a dime.

716
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:25,066
<i>I don't sew.</i>
<i>I'm a pageant girl.</i>

717
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,300
<i>I brought so many</i>
<i>beautiful garments.</i>

718
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,066
I spend money.

719
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,967
I don't want to get lost
with all the stuff that I got.

720
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,266
You know what I mean?

721
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:37,066
There's a fucking piggy bank.
A piggy bank.

722
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,934
Am I supposed to
mount this shit on my head?

723
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:42,066
Make it work, bitch.
Make it work.

724
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,100
Hello, hello, hello.

725
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,400
[all] Hi.

726
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,133
How's my dirty dozen?

727
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,233
[laughter]

728
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,633
Bob the Drag Queen.

729
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,100
RuPaul.

730
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,934
How did you get
Bob the Drag Queen?

731
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,967
How did that come about?
It's my dad's name.

732
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,900
My dad's name
is The Drag Queen.

733
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,600
[laughs]
It's a family name.

734
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,100
Yeah, Bob stands
for big old bottom, what!

735
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,967
[laughter]

736
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:08,467
Well, you know it does pay
to advertise.

737
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,600
Now which one did you get?

738
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,900
I got Gone With the Window.

739
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,867
Now do you know how to sew?

740
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,233
I'm not, like,
the world's best sewer,

741
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,934
but I know how
to slap a garment together.

742
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,500
So, you're not
the world's greatest sewer.

743
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,266
What are you
the world's greatest?

744
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,600
I'm a stand-up comedian.

745
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,166
Who's your competition?

746
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,967
You know, Ru, I don't want
to sound so, uh, stereotypical.

747
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,500
Do, do it, it's between us.

748
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,066
I don't--
I don't have competition

749
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,600
because no one here
does what I do.

750
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,967
I learned from listening
to your podcast

751
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,266
with you and Michelle,

752
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:37,200
that there really is no reason
to pretend to be modest.

753
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I'm fucking funny.
I'm really funny.

754
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,166
Let the world know.

755
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,066
First name, Bob,
last name, The Drag Queen.

756
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:45,066
Can she turn it?
Yes, she can.

757
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,367
[laughing]

758
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,300
It's true, girl.

759
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,533
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

760
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:52,400
-Thank you, Ru. Thank you.
-All right.

761
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,600
-Acid Betty.
-RuPaul.

762
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,934
How you doing?

763
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm gagging
that you just said my name.

764
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,900
I'm so honored to be here.

765
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,834
Yes, now tell me about
the Brooklyn drag scene.

766
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,066
Well, some of them are here.
Thorgy Thor is here.

767
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:09,133
Are you guys friends
or are you friendly rivals?

768
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,200
We're definitely friends.
We've never worked together.

769
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,300
I actually haven't worked with
a lot of queens in Brooklyn

770
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
because I mostly work
in Manhattan.

771
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,133
-Is that a read?
-It could be.

772
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,967
[laughter]

773
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,467
Describe for me
what Brooklyn drag is.

774
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,934
Technically, I guess,
Brooklyn drag right now

775
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:27,066
is unpolished,
um, hairy,

776
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,567
so I try and elevate myself
and shave my beard.

777
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:33,367
Uh-huh, all right.
Now, what challenge did you get?

778
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,233
The Money Ball.

779
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,667
Right, do you know how to sew?

780
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,000
I do, but this is, like,
paper and glue.

781
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,400
Now, I don't see
any paper or glue yet.

782
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,166
So I'm trying to build
a base first

783
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,934
and then attach the paper,
the money to it.

784
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,166
Right.

785
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,333
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

786
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,533
Thank you, RuPaul.

787
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,967
Layla McQueen.
What's going on, lady?

788
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,000
-Which challenge did you get?
-I got the Rupocalypse.

789
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,500
Rupocalypse!
So what do you have planned?

790
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Um, I was given, like,
a few plastic hands

791
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,533
and then like, a shit-ton
of camouflage.

792
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,066
I think camouflage

793
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:08,433
is a disgusting component
of human culture.

794
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,800
Okay, yeah.

795
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,166
Um, I'd really like to play
with the whole, like,

796
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:16,333
deconstruction, like,
jagged shapes and like...

797
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,066
Um...

798
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,934
-Rough around the edges.
-Yeah.

799
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,500
Now tell me,
how are you feeling?

800
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,467
You seem a little shy.

801
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:28,100
I am and we started
this day kind of...

802
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,834
It was--it was all--
it was a lot.

803
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,967
But now, I'm, like,
getting into the groove.

804
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,934
Well, listen, you better
get your shit together

805
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,266
because there's some
very competitive girls here.

806
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:38,467
Oh, good.

807
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,500
All right, Layla,
I can't wait to see it.

808
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,600
Thanks.

809
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,066
All right, listen up, ladies.

810
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,800
Tomorrow on the main stage,

811
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,900
we'll decide
how you measured up.

812
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,100
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

813
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,066
All right.

814
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,367
Oh, my God.

815
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,133
Timing is not my friend
right now.

816
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,633
Now I get why girls
have emotional breakdowns.

817
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,967
Amen.

818
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,066
Everyone is freaking out

819
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,066
because in the back of
everyone's mind,

820
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,633
while they're working
on their outfits,

821
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:11,667
is, "Fuck, I do not want
to go home first."

822
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,400
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

823
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,667
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

824
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,533
Whoo, we're back.

825
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,066
Hello, couture.

826
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,500
This thing is too big.

827
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,667
And that's not normally
a complaint.

828
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,367
Today is our very first runway

829
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,900
and everyone is just trying
to get their shit done.

830
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,233
So I'm not the
only one stressing.

831
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:34,467
And I'm burning myself,

832
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,433
and I'm burning myself,
and I'm burning myself.

833
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,934
Well stop burning yourself
and shut up.

834
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,266
Did you have to change
anything?

835
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,200
Nothing major,

836
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,333
but I made this clutch,
which I'm very proud of.

837
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,333
Oh, my God.

838
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:49,066
It is a known fact that
a lady do carry a bag to dinner.

839
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,867
This purse is hideous,
but I'm using it.

840
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,400
I think it goes
with the look though.

841
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,800
That was shade!

842
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
No!
I think it's cute.

843
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,800
Kim, you are shady.

844
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,834
I'm not,
I think it's cute.

845
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,667
Get away from me,
Shade Chi.

847
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,700
I actually
do a lot of pageants,

848
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,500
and I won this pageant.

849
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,900
It's an international pageant.
It's called Miss Continental

850
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,367
and it is one of
the most prestigious pageants.

851
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,934
I've heard of it.

852
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:14,567
Yeah, so I'm
a former Miss Continental.

853
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,066
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

854
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:17,533
I hate pageants.

855
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,100
Girl, I've done,
like, two pageants.

856
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,300
And you didn't win them and
that's why you hate pageants.

857
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,266
Exactly.

858
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:24,433
I knew it.
I knew it.

859
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,500
That always happens to someone
who don't win.

860
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,100
Bitch, I was robbed.

861
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,233
Like, to me, pageants are all
about the who's who of drag.

862
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,433
You know how many people
who would tell me,

863
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,367
"You're not gonna
win the pageant.

864
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,066
Why are you wasting your money?
Why are you doing that?"

865
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,133
Yeah, but you're gambling,
you're gambling your money.

866
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,834
Anything you do is a gamble,
remember that.

867
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,433
Are you really living

868
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,333
"Well, I'm not going to do it

869
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,066
because I don't know
the outcome."

870
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,066
Really?

871
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,467
This is the thing,
you don't have to compromise

You get what I'm saying?
Be you.

00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:55,934

00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,567
[RuPaul] Naysha Lopez,
Drag on a Dime.

1045
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,967
[Nicole] Fashion sure
is changing.

1046
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,967
<i>I am serving Greek goddess,</i>

1047
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,533
<i>giving you face for the gods.</i>

1048
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:51,266
<i>Face, body, glamour.</i>

1049
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:55,200
<i>And I am definitely serving</i>
<i>that all right now.</i>

1050
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,266
[Michelle] Peek-a-Ru, I see you.
[RuPaul] Uh-huh.

1051
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,567
[Michelle] A dress that
makes cents. Not dollars.

1052
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:01,700
[RuPaul] A dollar
make me holler.

1053
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,133
Kim Chi, Hair Ball.

1054
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,633
-[clears throat]
-[laughs]

1055
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,400
You got a little--

1056
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,233
[Michelle] Someone's in a furry.

1057
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,400
<i>I've made a lion outfit</i>
<i>inspired by Givenchy.</i>

1058
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,633
<i>I turned these ratty,</i>
<i>dirty blonde wigs</i>

1059
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,500
<i>into a golden treasure.</i>

1060
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,300
<i>This outfit is big, grand,</i>
<i>and conceptual.</i>

1061
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,834
<i>It's Kim Chi.</i>

1062
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:23,433
[Nicole] She stepped
that pussy up. Meow.

1063
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,967
[RuPaul] Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
Sugar Ball.

1064
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,467
[Michelle] Gumdrop it
like it's hot.

1065
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:31,066
<i>I feel like a goddess</i>
<i>of the snow.</i>

1066
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,567
<i>My "corselet"</i>
<i>is just sickening.</i>

1067
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:35,967
<i>It's sugar, azúcar.</i>

1068
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:37,400
<i>Are you ready for my cuckoo?</i>

1069
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,900
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-[all] Yes.</i>

1070
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,233
[RuPaul] Now see, that's
the real sugar right there.

1071
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,300
[Nicole] She's serving cake.

1072
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,300
[Michelle] That's her
sugar walls.

1073
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,066
[Nicole] Whoa!

1074
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:49,133
[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls,
Float Your Boat.

1075
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,433
[Carson] Washington's
cross-dressing the Delaware.

1076
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,433
[Nicole] She has
my dream chest.

1077
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:53,967
[Carson] Yeah.

1078
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,900
<i>I'm trying to give you</i>
<i>'90s supermodel walk</i>

1079
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,300
<i>and this boat is covering</i>
<i>half of it.</i>

1080
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,900
<i>When I can finally</i>
<i>step out of this boat,</i>

1081
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,300
<i>that's when the judges</i>
<i>can really see</i>

1082
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,633
<i>the true Naomi Smalls.</i>

1083
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:06,066
[Carson] Land ho.

1084
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>I am giving you</i>
<i>Naomi Campbell</i>

1085
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,166
<i>strutting down</i>
<i>a Versace runway.</i>

1086
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,567
[Michelle] Legzilla.

1087
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,934
[Ross] Oh, oh that, yeah.

1088
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:14,934
That boat looks heavy.

1089
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:16,900
Are there any seamen
to help her?

1090
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,066
[Michelle] Where are they?

1091
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:20,066
[Ross] The seamen
are all below deck.

1092
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,967
[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne,
Glitter Ball.

1093
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:24,967
[Carson] You know I always say,

1094
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,567
when life hands you
disco balls...

1095
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,300
-[Nicole] Oh.
-[Carson] What do you do?

1096
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,333
[Michelle] You make an outfit.

1097
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,367
[all laughing]

1098
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:31,333
[Ross] Yeah.

1099
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,934
<i>After my little meltdown,</i>

1100
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:34,800
<i>I'm just gonna roll</i>
<i>with the punches</i>

1101
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,300
<i>and I'm really feeling this</i>
<i>disco queen kind of vibe.</i>

1102
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,633
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

1103
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:40,900
[Ross] That's a disco ball?

1104
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,333
I thought that
was a fabulous globe.

1105
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,500
-[Carson] Yes.
-[Ross] It's her ring.

1106
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,333
[Carson] I thought it was
a Judith Leiber bag.

1107
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,266
-[RuPaul] Cocktail bag.
-[Carson] Balls to the walls.

1108
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,633
[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor,
Red Velvet Cake Couture.

1109
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,467
[Michelle] I'm hungry
for that creamy middle.

1110
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,900
[Nicole] This is feeling
a little menstrual.

1111
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,100
[all laughing]

1112
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,467
[RuPaul] I'm glad you said it
and I didn't.

1113
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,333
<i>I don't wear gowns,</i>

1114
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,266
<i>but for this challenge</i>
<i>I just wanted to feel decadent</i>

1115
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:05,066
<i>and I still kept</i>
<i>with my cartoon hair,</i>

1116
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>giving you cream cheese</i>
<i>realness.</i>

1117
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,266
[Michelle] Oh, happy birthday!

1118
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:11,433
[RuPaul] Have her cake
and serve it too.

1119
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:14,567
Robbie Turner,
Bitch Ball.

1120
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:15,967
Who let the dogs out?

1121
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:18,266
[Nicole] I love two bitches
on a runway.

1122
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:21,500
<i>I think I'm looking more like</i>
<i>a sheep than a poodle.</i>

1123
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,633
<i>The dog is looking at me like,</i>

1124
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,400
<i>"Get me the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>

1125
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,567
<i>I'm looking at the dog like,</i>

1126
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,567
<i>"Get</i><span style="bodyStyle"> me</i><i> the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>

1127
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,500
<i>This is not going well.</i>

1128
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,934
[RuPaul] Bow wow wow.

1129
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:31,233
[Michelle] Yippee yo,
yippee yay.

1130
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,133
[Ross] I give this look about
a canine out of 10.

1131
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:36,934
[RuPaul] Uh-huh, she's fade
and she's throwing shade.

1132
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:38,667
[Michelle] Those bitches
are over it.

1133
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,934
[RuPaul] Derrick Berry,
The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.

1134
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,100
[Ross] Well, hey, y'all.

1135
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,900
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>Christmas in Vegas.</i>

1136
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,600
<i>I'm representing showgirls.</i>
<i>I'm serving body.</i>

1137
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,066
<i>But I'm also giving comedy.</i>

1138
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:51,834
-[all] Whoa!
-[Ross] Ho, ho, ho.

1139
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:52,934
[Nicole] She's trimming
her bush.

1140
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,266
[RuPaul] Is that mistletoe
or camel toe.

1141
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,433
[Nicole] I respect that.

1142
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,266
[Carson] She's putting
the X back in Xmas.

1143
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:59,333
[RuPaul] Yes, she is.

1144
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,066
[Ross] Oops,
she's doing it again.

1145
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:04,967
[RuPaul] Layla McQueen,
Apocalyptic Couture.

1146
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:08,233
Now, her pussy's not on fire,
but her shoulder is.

1147
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:10,133
<i>This look</i>
<i>is classic Layla.</i>

1148
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,967
<i>I'm loving this cute</i>
<i>little jacket I made.</i>

1149
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,066
<i>I'm giving you, like,</i>
<i>a post-apocalyptic,</i>

1150
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,133
<i>like, devil commander, like,</i>
<i>she's coming up,</i>

1151
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,834
<i>the world is over</i>
<i>and I'm here to take over.</i>

1152
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,600
[Michelle] The thigh's
the limit.

1153
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,734
[RuPaul] Layla McQueen,
Beyond Thunderdome.

1154
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,567
Welcome, ladies.

1155
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:30,633
I feel like I just saw my whole
life flash before my eyes.

1156
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,200
[laughter]

1157
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,400
Now, ladies, when I call
your name, please step forward.

1158
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,667
Bob the Drag Queen.

1159
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:41,133
Dax ExclamationPoint.

1160
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,066
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

1161
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,066
Chi Chi DeVayne.

1162
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:49,400
Thorgy Thor.

1163
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:55,133
You are all...

1164
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,600
Safe.

1165
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,600
Thank you.

1166
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,300
And for the 100th time,

1167
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,867
safe is not a word I associate

1168
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:10,633
with America's Next
Drag Superstar.

1169
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:14,133
Now you may leave the stage.

1170
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:20,333
Time for the judges critiques.

1171
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:25,533
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1172
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,200
Now it's time
for the judges critiques.

1173
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,533
Acid Betty.

1174
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:31,967
I love that you're different.

1175
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:34,200
Every inch was kind of
covered with a thought.

1176
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,667
To me,
that's what drag is about.

1177
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:36,967
And then the photo,

1178
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,433
<i>you seem like you're a little</i>
<i>bit more of the avant-garde,</i>

1179
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:42,100
artsy, like, you're giving me
Tunnel 1993.

1180
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,500
-I was there.
-I might've seen you there.

1181
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,066
-You might've.
-Great job.

1182
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:49,867
Thank you Acid Betty.
Next up, Naysha Lopez.

1183
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:51,233
-You're gorgeous.
-Thank you.

1184
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,500
You're giving me Eva Longoria,
Miss America.

1185
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,800
Your makeup is stunning.

1186
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,400
I think, Naysha,
you're beautiful,

1187
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,066
but when you're part
of an ensemble photo,

1188
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,633
<i>you really want to stand out.</i>

1189
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,066
The dark hair and the dark top,

1190
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,900
I don't think it works
in this picture.

1191
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,367
I have a pet peeve
with seeing undergarments.

1192
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,667
So when you turn around
I see illusion net.

1193
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,200
Give me the full illusion.

1194
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
That big gold piece
just makes you look thick

1195
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,233
and I just don't think
it looks good.

1196
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:15,133
This is actually the first
garment I've ever made.

1197
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,467
I don't really sew.

1198
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:19,066
I felt like it was wearable

1199
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,967
and, you know,
I got the challenge down.

1200
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,467
All right, well,
thank you very much.

1201
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:28,367
-Next up, Kim Chi.
-Hi.

1202
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,300
Your photo is pretty fabulous.

1203
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,200
And I really like
your runway look.

1204
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,266
You are giving me, like,

1205
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:35,633
this Cowardly Lion
anime ferociousness.

1206
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:37,200
I think it totally worked.

1207
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,834
The artistry on your face
is just like geometric orgasm.

1208
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,066
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

1209
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,800
and say the walk
was a character choice.

1210
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,233
Every time I'm wearing
something different,

1211
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:50,500
I'm living whatever fantasy
of the outfit I've got going on.

1212
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,266
In my personal eyes,
I'm an anime character

1213
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:53,467
who works
as a high fashion model.

1214
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,133
You're just a total nerd.

1215
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:58,133
-I am.
-I love that.

1216
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:01,166
And by the way, I like that
you kept your areolas bald.

1217
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,333
The breasts are the windows
to the soul, for sure.

1218
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,567

1219
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:05,967
Nicole,
would you wear this?

1220
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:07,233
I would definitely
wear it.

1221
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:08,467
Where would you wear this?

1222
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:10,467
Um, probably school drop off.

1223
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:12,266
Okay, yeah.

1224
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,500
Thank you, Kim Chi.

1225
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,667
Next up, Naomi Smalls.

1226
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,066
I love that you
are rocking a boy chest.

1227
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:22,934
You're giving me
like, '70s "Studio 54."

1228
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,500
Michele,
how do you like her hair?

1229
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,633
Very pretty, only
my hairline's not clockable.

1230
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:31,300
Okay, all right.

1231
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
The Pride Float
was beautifully decorated,

1232
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,467
but it became really cumbersome.

1233
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:37,100
And I almost saw you thinking,

1234
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,233
"I have to get back in that boat
and strap it on."

1235
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,200
And I'm saying that
about the boat.

1236
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,934
Yeah, I know, how many times
have you said that in your life?

1237
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:46,066
-Girl.
-Yeah.

1238
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,533
But the picture.
Hello?

1239
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,900
And it's a big butt.

1240
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,867
That is a big butt.

1241
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,233
I believe they call that
serving it.

1242
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:53,467
Okay.

1243
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:55,834
That needs to come through
with everything that you do,

1244
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:59,066
whether you're dragging a
50-pound boat with you or not.

1245
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:01,400
Next up,
Robbie Turner.

1246
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,066
Your photo, I loved,

1247
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:05,233
because you're giving me kind of
funny glamour there.

1248
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:08,066
-You chose fur?
-It's like a fringe.

1249
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:11,066
Fringy kind of
carpety-looking stuff.

1250
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,266
You're literally a blob.

1251
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,066
We lose all shape and
from the side, it's even worse.

1252
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:18,066
And you got to choose
your challenge.

1253
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,967
I actually forgot that I--
to choose one for myself.

1254
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:24,066
I didn't have
my '40s dress pattern,

1255
00:48:24,066 --> 00:48:26,066
but I was trying to figure
it out, like,

1256
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:27,133
at the last minute.

1257
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:31,233
So, it was like a series
of misfortunate events.

1258
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:34,166
Do you think that you deserve
to be in the bottom.

1259
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:40,266
Um, no, I think
my personality is winning.

1260
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:43,100
All right, well, thank you
very much, Robbie Turner.

1261
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,967
Next up, Derrick Berry.

1262
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,900
Your look tonight,
it's adorable.

1263
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,333
I will say it's pretty simple.

1264
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,934
I like the comedic moment

1265
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:52,433
where you trimmed
your holiday bush.

1266
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:53,967
I love a bush
on the front door,

1267
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:55,367
but on the back door
not so much.

1268
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,900
-No.
-Definitely not berries.

1269
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,500
[laughter]

1270
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,333
And then your photo,

1271
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,467
like, everyone in this photo

1272
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,533
looks like
they're your backup dancers

1273
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:05,900
and you're the star.

1274
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,467
-Wow.
-We've seen Britney now.

1275
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:09,367
My personal challenge to you

1276
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,900
is to show me everything else
but Britney.

1277
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
-Okay.
-We love your Britney.

1278
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,834
I do want to see more of it,

1279
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:17,500
but we do want to see
other things.

1280
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,934
I want more!

1281
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:20,066
And I'll give you more.

1282
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,867
[laughter]

1283
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,233
You can't help yourself,
can you?

1284
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:26,233
Up next,
Layla McQueen.

1285
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,900
-Hi, Layla.
-Hey, bitch.

1286
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,200
I love the shoulder detail.

1287
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,333
Did you sew that?

1288
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,433
I sewed the jacket, yes.

1289
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,100
-That's pretty impressive.
-Thank you.

1290
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,266
But I felt like the bottom
half was just a cop out.

1291
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,934
This was a really fun category
I think to like,

1292
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:41,467
do, like,
totally, like, singe.

1293
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:43,934
To me, it's just like,
Wynonna Judd opened the oven

1294
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:45,433
too quickly and got
a little, like, you know,

1295
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,533
burnt on the outside.

1296
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:51,100
In the picture we lose you
crumpling up into a ball.

1297
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,233
You're with all these
kind of legendary people

1298
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:55,233
and it's almost like your
body's saying "I'm not worthy."

Do you think
that your missteps

1301
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,300
would warrant you
in the bottom?

1302
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,133
I think I have
a lot more to show

1303
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,133
and I don't think that I am...

1304
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:05,633
the least put together.

1305
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:07,400
Who do you think
is the least put together?

1306
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,000
I think Naomi.
Her look is very plain.

1307
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,834
Do you agree with that,
Naomi?

1308
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:17,533
No. I tried to take something
that was from a past season

1309
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:20,066
and make it new and fresh.

1310
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,533
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1311

us squirrel friends,

00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,934
what do you think?
Let's start with Acid Betty.

1316
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:36,367
I love Acid Betty.

1317
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,567
she's a little bit dangerous,
she's rock 'n' roll.

1318
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:41,834
In the photo she looks great,
but she is this punk girl.

1319
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,166
Like, give me
a little screaming...

1320
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,100
Ahh!
Tongue out punkness.

1321
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,867
I don't hate her photo,
and like her name implies,

1322
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,867
she's kind of a trip
and she's a little East Village.

1323
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:52,500
Well, you know, I did
a lot of antacid in the 60s

1324
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,400
and I think that Acid Betty
really represents that.

1325
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,033

Her photo, unfortunately,
I think she got lost.

1328
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,166
And also,
don't stand on that stage

1329
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,066
and tell us
it's the first dress you made.

1330
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,934
I mean, this is not the place
you make your first dress.

1331
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:09,400
-Girl.
-You make your first dress

1332
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,066
when you learn that
you're gonna come on the show.

1333
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:14,200

except for
that lumbering walk.

1341
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:30,967
Right, because
she was serving a little bit

of Sasquatch on the runway.

1343
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,367
Sasquatch that walk.

1344
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:34,633

of cheese.

Quite honestly,
if she put any creativity

1369
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,934

she could've turned it out

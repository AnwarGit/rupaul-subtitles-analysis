Duh, winning.

some marbles out there

13
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:31,400
and just called it a day.

to you and all my girls,

55
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,500

the title track

How are you?

61
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,767
- Fantastic.
It's great to see you.

62
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,767
- It's great to see you too.

63
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,300
- Now, being the first girl
to go...

64
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,367
- Uh-huh.
- Must really suck.

65
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,266
- To be honest, it's actually
been a mixed blessing

66
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,567
because, um,
since after the show, um,

67
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,266
it made people
even more interested in me

68
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,300
because they really did get
to see a lot of me.

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,734
- Now, it was revealed
during the show

70
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,433
that you had some work done
to look like Madonna.

71
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,133
- Yes. Uh-huh.

72
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,500
- Would you go further with it?

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,100
- I've had some
since I've been gone.

74
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
- Really?
- I have.

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
- What'd you have done?

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,734
- Um, just a little more
facial work.

77
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:16,767
Just a little here and there.

78
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,667
- Injections?
- Injections.

79
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,734
- Would you consider having
a little mini Lourdes created?

80
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,967
- You know what?

81
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,133
When Madonna fades out
and Lourdes becomes famous,

82
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,834
I think that's gonna be
my next solution,

83
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,266
and, um, I naturally
have brown eyes, so...

84
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,266
- Oh, really?

85
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,667
I naturally have
a brown eye too.

86
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,233
- Ooh!
- Well.

87
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,533
- Well, well, well.

88
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,967
- Now, having watched
the rest of the season at home,

89
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,800
which one of the challenges
would you have rocked?

90
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,333
- The Snatch Game.

91
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,500
- So can I put you on the spot

92
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,266
and give you
a Snatch Game question?

93
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,600
- Okay.
- For Madonna?

94
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,834
- It's my turn.
- Okay.

95
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,767
Dumb Dora is so dumb,

96
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,867
she thinks a Kardashian
is a blank.

97
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:00,633
- She thinks a Kardashian
is my next deejay boyfriend.

98
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,166
Deejay Kardashian.

99
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,667
- [laughs]

100
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,500
Fabulous, Madonna.

101
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,700
Lady Phoenix.
- Yes, Ru.

102
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,100
- Now, watching at home,

103
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,834
were you shocked
by your performance

104
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,233
as Lady Ta-Ta in the
drag queens from outer space?

105
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,734
- Well, you know, I've never
claimed to try to win an Oscar,

106
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,967
so, you know, I mean--

107
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,333
- How about a Golden Globe?

108
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,967
- I mean, possibly.

109
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,333
- NAACP Image Award?

110
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,633
So what did you think
when you saw yourself?

111
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,900
- Because I've never been in
front of the camera like this,

112
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,533
you know, they kept screaming
at me to cheat the camera,

113
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,200
cheat the camera,
and I'm like,

114
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,400
"What the fuck?
I don't cheat on anybody."

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm like, "what is going on?"

116
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,934
So, you know, it was really
like--really confusion.

117
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:40,967
- All right.

118
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,066
Mimi Imfurst.
- Hey, Ru.

119
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,900
- In the now legendary
lip-synch for your life...

120
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,066
- Oh, yes.

121
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,967
- When you threw India
over your shoulders...

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,367
What was going through your head
at the time?

123
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,767
- Well, I had been doing it
in my show for ten years.

124
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,333
You know, I've probably picked
up over 1,000 people.

125
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,667
Uh, I've never dropped anyone.
It's just something I do.

126
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,533
Like, some girls do splits
or death drops,

127
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:06,967
and that's what I do.

128
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,333
The stakes there seemed so high.

129
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,066
It's not you're lip-synching
for Mariah Carey's

130
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,266
<i>Glitter</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album, you know?</i>

131
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,867
You're lip-synching
for your life,

132
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,900
and it feels like
if you fail at this, you know,

133
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,467
you're gonna reach over
from behind your table,

134
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,934
reach in your Prada purse,
and pull out a gun,

135
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,233
and that's the end.

136
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,200
- Well, thank God you didn't
have a Prada purse.

137
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
- No, no.
- How did it feel?

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,934
What was going
through your head?

139
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,433
- [scoffs]
Craziness.

140
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,500
Like, it was just so out
of the blue, like, unexpected.

141
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,166
I was trying to perform,
and she would just,

142
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,767
like, move in front of me,
and I said,

143
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,400
"Okay, I want the judges
to see me."

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,533
Only way that y'all could see me
was to go down to the judges,

145
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,100
and in a split second,

146
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
I was seeing
the whole rest of the girls

147
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,066
in the back of the thing,

148
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,800
and I didn't know
what was going on.

149
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,734
Get her off of me!

150
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,133
I said, "Okay, I'm up
on this bitch's shoulder.

151
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,667
Like, what just happened?"

152
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,066
- I understand
it was over the top,

153
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,533
and it--it--you know,
and people--

154
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,066
there were people
who thought it was

155
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,200
the worst thing in the world,

156
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,266
there are people
who thought it was entertaining.

157
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,934
- Right, well, I want to ask
the other queens,

158
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,533
do you think it was entertaining
or was it over the line?

159
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,834
- In a show in New York,
you know, that's--that's okay.

160
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,233
You know, it's fun,
it's part of--

161
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,166
but, you know,
this is my chance.

162
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,300
- I can't say that I probably
wouldn't have bopped you, girl.

163
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
- Yeah, I think that also.

164
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,333
- 'Cause there's no screaming,
"Get me down, honey."

165
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,633
I'm gonna get myself down.

166
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,667
- And, India, what would you
have done differently?

167
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,767
- Actually, there was nothing

168
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,367
that I could have done
differently,

169
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,900
'cause I think
if I was anywhere else,

170
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,133
she still
would have done that.

171
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,567
Me as an entertainer,
I was there,

172
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,500
performing for you all.

173
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,734
Like, I paid no attention
to her,

174
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,066
other than her blocking me.

175
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,433
So I think
she should have done the same,

176
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,266
and she should have just gave it
her all at that moment.

177
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,100
- I respect that,
and I totally think--

178
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,367
I totally think
if I was in your position,

179
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,667
I would feel the same way.

180
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,066
Just to be clear, I was never
trying to sabotage you.

181
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,700
Like, it was for me,
it was like,

182
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,333
"What can I do to shake this up?

183
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,734
What can I do to make it
different?"

184
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,767
- In lip-synch for your life,

185
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,400
there is a certain
sort of fairness.

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,066
You're up to perform,

187
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:57,600
and if your focus
is to just get in the way

188
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,467
of the other girl...
- Right.

189
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,066
- It's not really
that professional.

190
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,367
- Isn't it a competition?

191
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,400
- You could have simply rolled
some marbles out there

192
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,667
and just called it a day.

193
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,767
- Yeah.
- No.

194
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,100
- So let's move on.

195
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,667
- Actually, I have
a little gift for India.

196
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,166
- Oh.
- Oh!

197
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,233
- Oh, goodness.
- Is it ticking?

198
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,600
- Does it have bullets in it?

199
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,333
- It's not ticking at all.

200
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,734
I got India Ferrah
this lovely shirt that says,

201
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,567
"I got picked up
by Mimi Imfurst,

202
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,300
and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt!"

203
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,500
- All right, now, India.
- Hi.

204
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,066
- Were you surprised when you
sashayed away when you did?

205
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,834
- I thought my time
was cut short.

206
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,967
I think two of the challenges,
I wasn't able to show

207
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,967
who I was as a person
or entertainer

208
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:43,633
due to the, um, duties
that I was given

209
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,834
from Carmen Carrera.

210
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,600
- By the way,
you did say duty.

211
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,066
- Oh, duty.
I'm sorry, duty.

212
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,800
- So what do you mean?

213
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,834
- The workout challenge.
- Right.

214
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,133
- Um, with the rubber band.

215
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,767
We're gonna lower it down,
ladies.

216
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,667
One, two, three, four.

217
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,200
- So the rubber thingamajiggie
prevented us

218
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,633
from seeing
your real personality?

219
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,400
- Absolutely, yeah.
- [laughs]

220
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,433
- Like...

221
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,433
[both laughing]

222
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,867
- Really?
- Yeah.

223
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,433
Like, where could I go
with a rubber thingamajiggie?

224
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,367
- Well, if you know,
the other girl won the challenge

225
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:16,834
with the thingamajiggie.

226
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,066
- Yeah, with the lip gloss.
Yeah, that's very true.

227
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,500
I just wasn't clever enough
at that moment

228
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,633
to pull out a thing
of lip gloss or eat chicken.

229
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,400
- [laughing]

230
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,900
Now, I gotta say,

231
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,133
I'm hearing a lot
of excuses right now.

232
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,800
- Well, that's what I do, Ru.

233
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,300
- [laughing]

234
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,266
- I laid 'em out,
card by card.

235
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,066
- So had there been a challenge
about excuses,

236
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,166
you would have...

237
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,767
- Well, like, every challenge

238
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:44,367
after I got kicked off,
I would have succeeded in.

239
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,834
Like, I'm not even lying.

240
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,567
Like the cake challenge,
because I sew,

241
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,133
sew all my costumes
and gowns and stuff,

242
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,567
so I would have definitely
succeeded in that.

243
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,066
- You would have ate that.

244
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,333
- Yeah, I would have ate it up.
- Well, that's the thing.

245
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,867
That's the thing
about this competition.

246
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,400
It's almost like
a roll of the dice.

247
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,667
- Right.

248
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,333
- You've basically got to be
a jack of all trades.

249
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,500
- Exactly.

250
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,333
- Mariah aka Mariah Paris

251
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,066
aka Mariah Balenciaga

252
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:13,567
aka Mariah Successful.

253
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,333
Now, before you came here--
of course, you did balls,

254
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,567
uh, and the ballroom scene
down in Atlanta.

255
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,166
- Yes, I do balls.
- We've all done balls.

256
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,200
- Now, do you think
being a ballroom queen and,

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,100
uh, and not being
a nightclub girl,

258
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,333
uh, put you at a disadvantage
in the competition?

259
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,200
- Um, yeah, it did,
a little bit,

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,100
because I don't do it
every week.

261
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,700
The changing, the transition.

262
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
I also don't have to learn
lyrics.

263
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,700
- Oh, you're talking about
your lip sync now, aren't you?

264
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,633
- Well, yes.

265
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,066
That was my disadvantage.

266
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,166
- [laughs]

267
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,667
Because you saw the lip sync,

268
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,367
there wasn't a lot
of lip-syncing to the--

269
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,533
- No.
- But you--

270
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,367
- But I-I-I will mug
the shit out of you, though.

271
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,834
- She was.
- Baby.

272
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,900
- Plugs for days, girl.
- Okay?

273
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,300
I will mug the shit
out of you.

274
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
- Well, what do you do
when you don't know the lyrics?

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,567
- You know what?
I just study BeBe Zahara Benet.

276
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,800
- [laughs]

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,900
- You move your lips enough,

278
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,166
and they'll think
that you are turning it.

279
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,000
- [laughing]

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,567
What kind of fan mail
have you gotten?

281
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,700
- I've gotten
so many touching letters

282
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,567
about people who were inspired
by my confidence.

283
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,967
They know drag queens,

284
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:23,734
we go through a lot
of adverse experiences in life

285
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,834
and we still walk around
with our heads held high.

286
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,967
There was this one young girl,

287
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,266
she went through
a tragic experience,

288
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,834
and she felt the need
to reach out

289
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,166
and just tell me her story
and get it out.

290
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,600
Just the fact that me just being
who I am impacted somebody,

291
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,233
it was very touching.

292
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,934
There's no words.

293
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:48,266
- These next two queens
supersize our love of drag.

294
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:51,567
Give it up
for Miss Stacy Layne Matthews

295
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,066
and Miss Delta Work!

296
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,133

this queen returned to take
the competition by storm.

Stacy Layne Matthews.

- Hello.

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,567
- From Back Swamp,
North Carolina.

Now, how has doing<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

of Back Swamp now, so...

322

- Really?

323
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,967
- I go outside, you know,
walk out my door,

324
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,800
and, like, my cousins,
and like, "Oh, my God, hey!

325
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,233
Hey, girl, oh, my God!
It's Stacy!"

326

I'm like, "Honey,
it's still me, honey."

- [laughs]

328
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,633
Do you have any beef
with any of the other queens?

329
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:05,300
- Um, when I first watched
a show,

330
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,667
I was pretty upset
with a lot of things

331
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,734
a lot of people had to say,
especially Delta.

332
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,867
I love her,
but there was one point

333
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,400
where you said I shouldn't
have been in the competition

334
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,633
from the beginning.

335
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,100
- I want to be here with people

336
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,066
that I think are the fiercest
in competition

337
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,433
so that when I win,
I can feel like I had a victory

338
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,066
over people who were
just as strong as me.

339
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,967
And I don't think
you're just as strong as me.

340
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,300
- You barely knew
anything about me,

341
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,633
and those things,
you know, really hurt

342
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:30,934
when you said that.

343
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,700
- I apologize if they hurt,
I really do.

344
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,667
Did I read?
Absolutely.

345
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,700
Did I talk shit?
Absolutely.

346
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
But my intention wasn't
to hurt someone's feelings.

347
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,633
This is a sorority
and a fraternity

348
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,800
at the same time.

349
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,266
Part of drag is sitting back
and talking shit.

350
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,266
"Girl, you got that big old wig
on again?"

351
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,433
But did I think
I was more cut out

352
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,100
for the competition
from the outset?

353
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
I did think so.

354
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,667
Obviously I was wrong,

355
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,300
because you were winning
before I was.

356
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,800
- Did you find out
anything new about yourself

357
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,066
that you didn't know?

358
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,633
- I did.

359
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,900
I found out that maybe I,
on some level,

360
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,667
I could have been more
of a "lady" like Stacy.

361
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,967
I mean, I could learn a lot
from Stacy.

362
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:11,066
Sometimes when I answer
people's questions,

363
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,767
it's probably better
to tell them

364
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,100
what they want to hear,
not what I really think.

365
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,166
Because honestly,
at the end of the day,

366
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,233
maybe the high road
would have been to just say,

367
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,667
"Yes, I think
you look beautiful.

368
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,734
Yes, I think you're
my fiercest competition."

369
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:27,400
Because it really--
the answer either way

370
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,533
wouldn't have mattered

371
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,700
and would have been easier
to stomach.

372
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,367
- Was it a positive experience
for you

373
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,800
or a negative experience?

374
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,266
- There were negative aspects,
but as a whole, it was positive.

375
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:39,834
I mean, I've been given so much

376
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,133
that was never promised to me.

377
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,166
Nothing was promised to me
from this,

378
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,900
and I've been able to travel.

379
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,767
I mean, I'm 35 years old.
I've never been to New York.

380
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,533
I got to go to New York
and walk red carpets,

381
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,934
and I just have been
afforded so much.

382
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm so lucky.

383
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,967
- Stacy Layne, do you think
you're forever changed

384
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,066
from having done this show?

385
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,900
- Oh, Lord, yes, honey.

386
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,667
I've even had marriage proposals
from Africa.

387
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,900
- Oh.

388
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,700
- So I might have to take
myself up on the offer.

389
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,066
- Kamaru.
[laughter]

390
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,867
- Shangela, you're back again.

391
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:11,934
I can't seem to get rid of ya.

392
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,800
- I'm back, Ru.
I'm back.

393
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,734
- Now, how'd it feel
to be given a second chance?

394
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,166
- You know, I feel like I had
a lot of pressure,

395
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,166
I had a lot to prove,

396
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,066
but I really feel
like I belonged

397
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,800
in this competition,
and I was thrilled to be back.

398
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,233
- Do you feel like
you redeemed yourself?

399
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,834
- Well, hallelu, I hope I did.

400
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,333
- [laughing]

401
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,200
Now, you seem to be one
of the most strategic queens

402
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,867
that have ever been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

403
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,166
- Well, thank you.

404
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,767
- Do you think it helped you
or hurt you in the end?

405
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,700
- I mean, top five.

406
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,333
I definitely feel
like it helped me.

407
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,867
-<i> Entertainment Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reports</i>
that you were just cast

408
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,133
in the new TV show
with Don Johnson.

409
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,500
Tell me about that.

410
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,934
- I recently was cast in a pilot
called<i> A Mann's World.</i>

411
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,767
It's being directed, created,
and written

412
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,066
by Michael Patrick King.

413
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,500
I play a male hairstylist
on the show,

414
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,867
so I'm really excited
about that.

415
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,200
But I'm also excited
about continuing Shangela.

416
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
So I'm dual pathing it,

417
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,767
kind of like Beyoncé
and Sasha Fierce.

418
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,600
- Oh, okay.
- Indeed.

419
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,066
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hi, Ru.

420
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,066
- Now, did your stepdaughter
watch the show?

421
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,900
- She did.
- What'd she think?

422
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,233
- Well, I mean, she is--

423
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,867
she's six years old,
so she doesn't

424
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,900
really get the whole,
like, competition.

425
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,066
She wants me to put her in drag.

426
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,367
She wants me to--
you know, she's like,

427
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,800
"I want the same eye shadow
as Carmen,"

428
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,633
and "I want the same lipstick
as Carmen."

429
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,900
She'd ask my husband, like,
"Why is Chris wearing makeup?"

430
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,533
And once you, you know,
answer the question,

431
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,633
it's like she's cool with it.

432
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,133
You know,
she's really smart, so...

433
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,133
- Yeah.

434
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,600
Now, were you surprised
when the judges

435
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,734
brought you back?

436
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,734
- I was.

437
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,367
I was really surprised
and grateful,

438
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,567
more than anything.

439
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,400
- Now, in the music challenge,

440
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,500
Shangela manipulated it
so that you would get reggae.

441
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,200
What do you think about that?
- I don't think so.

442
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
Honestly,
when it came down to it,

443
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,900
I was not gonna go
with country, period.

444
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,066
- But, Shangela,
you did have a strategy.

445
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,800
- With us being
the last two left,

446
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,867
I didn't want reggae,

447
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,633
so my strategy
was to make her feel

448
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,900
like I wanted reggae.

449
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,166
I set that up.

450
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,233
Can I have that deal
on the reggae?

451
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,400
I love reggae music,
like, buh, buh, buh.

452
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,834
Ba-da, buh, buh.

453
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,266
- I really like reggae.

454
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,734
So I'm gonna go with reggae.
- Okay.

455
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,867
- If there was a competitive
spirit within her,

456
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,200
where she didn't want me
to have what I wanted--

457
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,767
- Regardless of whatever
Shangela was saying,

458
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,066
I wasn't gonna think
in my mind, "Okay,

459
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,100
"well, she wants reggae,
so I'm gonna pick reggae

460
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,734
so I can mess her up,"
you know what I mean?

461
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,767
That's not the way I think.

462
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,200
You know, competition or not,

463
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,867
I don't purposely try
to sabotage anyone.

464
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,767
If it came down--
let's say if it was me

465
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,233
and, you know,
if I was in the top three,

466
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,834
that's a different story,
you know what I'm saying?

467
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,500
'Cause it's already--
you--fine.

468
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,233
- But how do you get to the top
three without competing?

469
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,500
- No, but you don't have
to throw people under the bus.

470
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,166
You don't have to, you know,
think like that.

471
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,433
You can just be the best.

472
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,500
You can just be the best,
and then you can win.

473
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,266
- Could you just push them
in front of the subway train?

474
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,400
- [laughs]
- No.

475
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,767
- Now, Shangela,
it seems like you have

476
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,066
a different point of view
in terms of strategizing.

477
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,066
Care to elaborate on that?

478
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,367
- Well, I think everyone
has their own--

479
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,300
their own objective
in this competition.

480
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
I was here, fighting to win,

481
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,100
because it meant a lot more
than just the check.

482
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,500
It meant security;
it meant being able

483
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,700
to provide for my family
and to pursue my dreams,

484
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,266
'cause that's why
I'm really here.

485
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,433
- Yara Sofia,<i> echa pa'lante.</i>

486
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,700
- Yes.

487
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,066
- Are you feeling
the<i> echa pa'lante</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

488
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,066
down in Puerto Rico?

489
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,200
- Of course, darling.

490
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
- You're still serving it up?
- Yes, I do.

491
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,934
- Yes, darling.

492
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,600
- Very sad
to see your elimination.

493
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,767
- I know.

494
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:30,800
- You gave up during
the middle of the number.

495
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,734
- I'm crying because there's
a lot of emotions.

496
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,233
I was thinking too much.

497
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:43,266
I'm so angry,
and I'm so disappointed.

498
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,433
During the competition,
I was, like,

499
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,266
holding in a lot of emotions.

500
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:51,066
Challenge after challenge
every week,

501
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:54,667
it's so challenging,
you know what I mean?

502
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:59,900
I kind of disagrees
with some of the judgment.

503
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,967
The judges, like, sometimes
putting other one on top of me,

504
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,633
like, over.

505
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,967
Like, "Oh, my God,
I love you,

506
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,500
"the way you fart,
the way you fall,

507
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,900
the way you walk,
the way you wear everything."

508
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
And then I was like,
"Oh, okay."

509
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,333
I don't think I agreed,
you know what I mean?

510
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,367
- Right.

511
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,867
Who were they praising over you

512
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,700
that made you feel that way?

513
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,100
- Well, it depends.

514
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,533
- Names, darling, I want names.

515
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,066
- Raja.
She's a great makeup artist.

516
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,700
And she could do a better job.

517
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,200
If you choose this kind of drag,
be the best.

518
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,266
- Do you feel that you could
have gone a little bit further?

519
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,500
- Where's further?

520
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,934
- Could you have pushed more,

521
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,233
<i>echa pa'lante?</i>

522
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,100
- Yeah, probably.

523
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,066
But, um, after you--

524
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:55,266
um, the judges
asked us the question, like,

525
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:59,233
"Why you deserve to be
the next drag superstar

526
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,734
and win 75 fucking dollars?"

527
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,066
- [laughs]
- Thousand.

528
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,667
- Yeah. [laughs]

529
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,467
It was a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.

530
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:09,967
- And uh, it--
probably in another moment--

531
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,333
- That's a perfect point,
because it does come down

532
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,500
to how you react in that moment.

533
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,734
- Yes.

534
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:16,734
- And a lot of this competition

535
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,767
emulates what real life is

536
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,266
in show business,
and sometimes,

537
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,700
it comes down to that moment

538
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,567
where I cannot go on
any further,

539
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,500
but somewhere,
that energy's gotta come.

540
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,567
- It's out of--
it's out of my hands.

541
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,166
- Yeah, I understand.

542
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,367
I understand.
All right.

543
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,900
Let's see what
the top three queens have to say

544
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,100
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>

545
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,467
Are you ready
for the final three?

546
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,600
First, let's welcome

547
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,900

honey.

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900

00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:00,066
The jig is up.
Bam!

00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,000

[drumroll]

- And now, the one queen

565
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,233
who, week after week,

566
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,667
had us gagging
on her charisma,

567
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,767
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,

568
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,900

579

- Alexis Mateo, honey.

580
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,900
- Hi, Ru.
Bam!

581
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
- Bam!

582
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,166
Is your family proud,
how well you did?

583
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,233
- My family has been
very supportive.

584
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,333
My mom became
one of my biggest fans.

585
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,567
It actually helped me
to understand

586
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,800
my family point of view
about the situation,

587
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,967
because I grew up in a very
Catholic, Pentecostal family.

588
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,066
- Ooh, child.
- And now--yes.

589
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,600
We have been mediating

590
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,934
between what was
the homosexuality

591
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:26,367
and, like, the whole drag
experience in my family.

592
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,166
But now they see me as an actor,

593
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,667
more than just a wannabe woman.

594
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,867
That it was the point
that I really wanted

595
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,800
to put across in my family.

596
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,934
- Yeah.

597
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,433
Now, this was your third
audition for the show.

598
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,433
- Yes.

599
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,667
- Uh, what do you--
how do you think

600
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,500
it would have turned out
had you been chosen

601
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,767
the first go-round?

602
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,233
- Oh, child, if I was chosen

603
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:46,734
the first season
or the second one,

604
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,700
I probably went home
the first two episodes.

605
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,100
- Really?
- Think about it that way.

606
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,734
- Exactly,
and I would have come back,

607
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,100
in the third one in a box.

608
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,567
[laughter]

609
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,934
- What would you say to queens

610
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,467
who have auditioned
in previous seasons,

611
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:04,300
like yourself,
and didn't get chosen.

612
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,600
- Keep trying.

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
When the fire is there

614
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,800
and when you wake up
in the morning,

615
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,767
that's what you want to do,
go for it.

616
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,667
Never, never give up.

617
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,900
- Now in the Life, Liberty,
and Pursuit of Style challenge,

618
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,834
you revealed you had
a relationship

619
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:19,400
with an active duty marine.

620
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,467
- Papi, I want you
to come back home, baby.

621
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,967
- Have you heard from him
since the show's aired?

622
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,433
- [laughs]
Not at all, Ru.

623
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,333
And I wish him the best.

624
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,567
I already closed that chapter
in my life.

625
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,934
- What would you say
if I told you

626
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,800
we have him backstage
right now?

627
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,700
[laughter]

628
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,934
In drag.

629
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:40,166
- In drag?
[laughs]

630
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,900
- Can you bring him out now?

631
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,200
- Yes, immediately,
please!

632
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,967
- We are not that kind of show.

633
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,633
We can't afford the airfare.

634
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,166
But we could afford
a DNA result,

635
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,266
and the result is...

636
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,500
[laughter]

637
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,600
Manila Luzon.

638
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,266
- Hi, Ru.
Hey, girls.

639
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,800
- Hey, girlfriend.

640
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,100
- [laughs]

641
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,200
- Now, let's get
into the real story here

642
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,333
that's been
on everybody's mind.

643
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,133
Your characterizations
of Asian-Americans

644
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:11,166
or just Asians in general
came under a lot of heat.

645
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,066
Have you heard
from groups or people

646
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:16,600
who say you were wrong
or you were right?

647
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,266
- When the episode
of the news challenge aired...

648
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,400
Klistin, "terr" us,

649
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,834
what's next?

650
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,900
I got a lot
of, um, negative feedback

651
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,233
saying people thought
it was offensive,

652
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,633
but they were always,
like, not Asian.

653
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:32,500
Comment after comment
left on my Facebook page.

654
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,667
"Um, I'm Asian.

655
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,967
"I didn't find that offensive.

656
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,133
I thought it was hilarious."

657
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,066
It's also the whole thing
of humor.

658
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,166
If it's not kind of--
if it doesn't push any buttons,

659
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,166
it's not funny.

660
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,633
- Now, there were a lot
of emotions

661
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,567
for you on this show.

662
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,967
Uh, your father,

663
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,667
did he get to see the show?

664
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,567
- After I got back home,
I called him up,

665
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,567
I sent him a letter,
and he wrote me back,

666
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,867
and he said,
"Okay, I understand that's--

667
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,100
"this is what you're doing,

668
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,900
but it's still
a little strange for me."

669
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,100
So it was just like
an open discussion

670
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,133
that I'm just trying
to keep, like--

671
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,300
let him, like,
marinate in a while.

672
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,400
- Did your mother
watch the show?

673
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
- My mom watches the show,

674
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,133
and she's always
calling me back, like,

675
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,166
"Oh, my God,
Carmen's so pretty."

676
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm like,
"Mom, what about me?"

677
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,467
[laughter]

678
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,300
- And, Miss Raja,

679
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,900
how's it feel to be
America's next drag superstar?

680
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,633
- Surreal.

681
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,533
Surreal, abstract.

682
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,266
Sometimes invasive a little bit,

683
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,767
'cause there's a lot of haters
out there,

684
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,333
which is kind of
a new thing for me.

685
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:36,233
- Now, your win is
actually very controversial,

686
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,567
and, you know,
uh, some people have--

687
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:41,500
saw you as the fiercest thing
ever to walk a runway,

688
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,633
and other critics have said
you're just a man in a dress.

689
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:47,166
- You mean her?
I'm just kidding.

690
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,166
- Well, actually,
that was Alexis Mateo's quote.

691
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,133
[laughter]

692
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,967
- If it were said to me
ten years ago

693
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,400
and I was at a different place
in my head and in my life,

694
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,767
I would have been
completely offended,

695
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,767
and I would have told everyone
to fuck off,

696
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,767
but, you know,
now I'm in my early 30s.

697
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,433
- Uhh!
[laughter]

698
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:07,667
- My mid--mid-30s,
and you know what?

699
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,266
I've just come to a place
in my life

700
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,500
that I don't really mind
embracing the fact

701
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,133
that there's a masculine
and a feminine.

702
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,567
And why not join
the two together

703
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,900
and morph it into
one amazing creature, right?

704
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,066
- Well, it worked
for Bea Arthur.

705
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:21,834
- Absolutely.
[laughter]

706
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:25,100
- Now, you kids all have
Twitter and Facebook and all.

707
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,066
Do you read the comments
from the people out there?

708
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,233
- Um, I do,
and I don't.

709
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,233
On Twitter, you're only allowed
a certain amount of characters

710
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,700
to cuss someone out.

711
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,333
And on Facebook, it takes
a little bit more effort

712
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,600
'cause you have
to like the bitch first

713
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,400
and then leave her
a mean comment.

714
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,133
- Well, a lot of people
have said that Raja

715
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:44,934
was too, uh, experienced
for the competition.

716
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:45,934
Do you feel that way?

717
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,266
- As far as me being seasoned,

718
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:48,767
yes, I am seasoned.

719
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,967
And, yes, I have been doing it
a long time.

720
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,567
And, yes,
people do know who I am.

721
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:57,367
But there was nothing said that
America's next drag superstar

722
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:00,200
should be a beginner who's never
been known or seen, you know?

723
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,300
- Or maybe she could have been.

724
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,500
- She could have been,
you know?

725
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,900
There's still a long line
and legacy

726
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,467
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
still yet to happen,

727
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:07,533
I hope, you know?

728
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,667
And I think
there's a lot of room

729
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,166
for different styles,

730
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,500
different points of view
in drag and what--

731
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
how we perceive
our own personal art.

732
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,567
I think there's still
tons of room for that.

733
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,066
Now I want to talk
about something

734
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:24,400
that was touched on earlier.

735
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,567
Delta said that
we were like a sorority

736
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:29,066
and a fraternity mixed together.

737
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:32,800
And there's a lot of comments
that sometimes backstage,

738
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,133
we are harsh with one another.

739
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:38,066
But the truth is,
if we were in a locker room,

740
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,867
some of the things
that wives would hear from men--

741
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,700
and we are men--
could be harsh too.

742
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,467
We call it, what's the T?

743
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,800
And the T being the truth.

744
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
I want to open the floor
about that.

745
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,900
Now, Raja, you came under
a lot of criticism

746
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,066
because you could be seen
as harsh

747
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,633
with your backstage speak.

748
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,100
- It was like watching
a sports event.

749
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,867
You know, no one wants
to go to the soccer game

750
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,600
and, like, hope that
the two teams love each other.

751
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,700
"Oh, my God.

752
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,967
"I hope he gives the ball
to that guy.

753
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,800
Oh, my God.
I hope that he makes the goal."

754
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,767
Nobody does that.

755
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,133
There's a battle that happens.

756
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,300
Reading is fundamental,
and I think

757
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,133
it's definitely part
of drag culture,

758
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,433
and it's fun.

759
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,367
It's our way of like,
you know,

760
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,600
straight guys
come up to each other,

761
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,066
and they punch each other
on their shoulder.

762
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,300
That's what we're doing.

763
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,066
- To me, I think it's a way
of sharpening your wit

764
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,300
and getting quicker
and thinking quicker,

765
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,867
and you have to be on your game.

766
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:30,367
And it's like practicing
before a baseball game.

767
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,633
You have to throw
that ball hard,

768
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:32,867
and you have to do it quick,

769
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,400
and you have to catch it hard

770
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,467
and throw it right back.

771
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,767
- Shangela, do you agree?

772
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:40,467
- Some of the things that I saw
throughout the season,

773
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,300
just, they didn't sit well
with me,

774
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,400
and I hate to keep even
giving it attention,

775
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
but this whole
Heathers/Boogers thing,

776
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,533
that's ridiculous.

777
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,967
But if you want
to put someone down

778
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,266
to build yourself up,
then, you know,

779
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,400
that's what you have
to do for yourself.

780
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
I mean, if this is
the face of Booger,

781
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,500
I think it's sickening,
so ta-da.

782
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,834
Hell, minus the lawsuits
and the prostitutes

783
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,100
and the drugs
and the tiger blood,

784
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,433
I'm the Charlie Sheen of drag.

785
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,400
Duh, winning.

786
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,066
- Alexis,
did you feel put down

787
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,200
by being called a Booger?

788
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,734
- No, I think
it was stupid as hell.

789
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:13,367
It was hilarious to listen
to a person

790
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:16,867
believing on that
to make herself feel better.

791
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:19,433
- Honestly, 'cause I heard it,
like, three times today,

792
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,934
you guys were saying, "Oh, well,
we're calling you Boogers

793
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,533
so that we can feel better
about ourselves."

794
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:24,967
I don't think that's
what it was at all.

795
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:26,567
- Well, why did you call us
a Booger?

796
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,266
- Because it's not shady.

797
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,967
It's funny.
It's just for fun.

798
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,166
- To you.

799
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,333
- But if you take it
that personal,

800
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,333
that's your insecurity.

801
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,133
- No, baby,
it's not insecurity.

802
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,633
It's clockin' it how it is.
Let's get it real.

803
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,333
If you want to bring it,
let's do it.

804
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:44,600
- Who else didn't think
that Heathers versus Boogers

805
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,367
was funny or tongue-in-cheek?

806
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,834
- When I first started drag,
I was a Booger down.

807
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,734
You know,
I was a Booger for years.

808
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,900
- Explain what that is.

809
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
- Well, a Booger
is just a term that, in drag,

810
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,734
of just being, like, a busted,
like, unpolished mess.

811
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:04,934
- When you call us Boogers,
you're calling us not polished.

812
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,166
- A mess.

813
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,734
- A mess, a beginner.

814
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:09,266
- I think what--
what's happening here

815
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:13,934
is that people are taking
everything so damn literal.

816
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:16,066
It wasn't a reference point of,

817
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:18,734
you look physically
like a booger.

818
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:20,567
It was a state of mind.

819
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,066
And that fact was
that we're grown men.

820
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,433
We know our names
aren't Heather,

821
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,834
even though they're
right here on our necks.

822
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,567
We know that
that's not the case.

823
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,967
And we kept doing it
over and over

824
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,300
because it was
the audacity of that.

825
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,166
The audacity that
this farting Mexican man up here

826
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,300
in a blond wig
is really Heather.

827
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,367
- Why did you call

828
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,333
this particular group of girls
Boogers?

829
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,834
- Because it's extreme,
it's funny,

830
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,767
it's exaggerated,
as much of what drag is.

831
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,166
And it's not that we were being,
you know, literal,

832
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,200
and we're not really
putting you down.

833
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,300
It was just like,
at some point,

834
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,734
the whole idea of Heathers
and Boogers

835
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:54,900
just kind of dissipated for me

836
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,467
and Heathers just meant
my three little friends

837
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:58,700
that I felt safe around.

838
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,367
- Who would you consider
the queen of the Boogers?

839
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,633
- Personally, I had my most,

840
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,400
biggest frustrations
with Shangela,

841
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,500
so in my mind,
I think it would be Shangela

842
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
'cause that was my, like...

843
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,767
- Nemesis.
- My nemesis at the time.

844
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,233
- Now, Stacy, when I asked
who was offended

845
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:15,200
by the word "booger,"
you raised your hand.

846
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,433
What's going on?

847
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,100
- Just listening
to the comments,

848
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,166
I just felt like it was
a little bit different

849
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,533
than what I saw in person,

850
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:24,700
because I felt this nice,
kind people in front of me,

851
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,100
and then to watch it,
the behind the scenes,

852
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,834
and to see what people
"really" thought about me,

853
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,300
it was very difficult for me,
and it took a toll on me.

854
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,500
- What specifically?

855
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,467
I want to know
what specifically?

856
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,166
Who offended you the most?

857
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,000
- Raja, basically, you know,
just saying

858
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,767
that I shouldn't be here anyway,
I shouldn't be here at all.

859
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:44,166
The whole bullfrogs thing,
it bothered me so much.

860
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,133
- Looking at the episodes,
I'm like,

861
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,400
"Some of the things that I said
were quite harsh," you know?

862
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,767
And I was just kind of
blurting them out

863
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,133
and just being a badass
about it,

864
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,367
but I don't think
I really meant it

865
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,700
to hurt anyone's feelings.

866
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,300
The Heathers
and the Boogers thing

867
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,700
was all meant to be fun
and light,

868
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,200
and it still should be
sort of that,

869
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,867
but it really shouldn't be taken
literal,

870
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,400
and if I could actually
just sort of just squash it

871
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,533
and not really perpetuate it
any further--

872
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,433
I mean, I feel like Stacy
was probably

873
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,900
the most vulnerable
out of the group.

874
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,800
And apparently the things
that were said

875
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,066
have really hurt her,

876
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,834
and if I could just sort of
reach out to you,

877
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,467
and I don't know if it means
anything to you at all,

878
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,500
but I would like to present you
with my Heathers necklace,

879
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,133
which really means a lot to me.

880
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,967
Wait, just hold on.
I want you to have this, so...

881
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,333
- Yay, I'm a Heather.

882
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,600
[laughter]

883
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,667
- I love you.
- Aw!

884
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:28,767
- Yay.

885
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,433
- That's very nice.

886
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,900
[applause]
That's very nice.

887
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,500
I tell you what,
from this moment on,

888
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,867
there will be no more Heathers;

889
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,200
there will be no more Boogers.

890
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,834
We will all be referred to
as Hoogers.

891
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,834
[laughter]
- Hoogers!

892
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:45,667
- Queens, get your questions
ready for Michelle Visage,

893
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,233
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
continues.

894
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,266
Now, this season,
my best squirrel friend,

895
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:58,166
Michelle Visage,
joined the judges' panel,

896
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,567
and the main stage
will never be the same.

897
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,767
Hey, Michelle.

898
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,133
- Hey, baby.
- [laughs]

899
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,934
Now, this season,
you had a chance

900
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,467
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens,

901
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:13,133
and you chose
Miss Carmen Carrera.

902
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,367
- I did.

903
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:17,100
- Now, let me ask
what's on America's mind.

904
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,367
Why?

905
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,767
- Look at her.
No, really--

906
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,667
- Is it because
you're from New Jersey?

907
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,800
- Yes,
that's exactly why, Ru.

908
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,233
- [laughing]

909
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,700
- Repping the Garden State.
No.

910
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,367
Billy Santino and I
felt that--

911
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,734
Delta came up,
Mariah came up.

912
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:36,066
We were all back and forth,

913
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:37,633
trying to figure out
who to bring back,

914
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:40,867
and in the end,
we all agreed unanimously

915
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:43,066
that Carmen
was fresh on the mind,

916
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,867
fresh on the lips,
and we knew

917
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,700
that she had more tricks
up her sleeve,

918
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,934
or so we thought.

919
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,800
- Now, Alexis, you almost
left the competition

920
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
because of comments

921
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
that you felt Michelle made
about you.

922
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,367
- Yeah.

923
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,200
I think you're a bitch,
Michelle.

924
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,834
[laughter]

925
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,667
- It's frustrating
'cause we're dealing

926
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,100
with so much pressure,

927
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,667
and, like, I mean, you think

928
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,867
you're killing
the hip-hop moment.

929
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:08,834
You a little came down,
and she got--

930
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,367
she bring you back in
120 degrees.

931
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,266
She's like,
"You're not giving me hip-hop.

932
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,400
"You're Hannah Montana,

933
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,900
a hooker version
of Hannah Montana."

934
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,266
- This is like Hannah Montana
does hip-hop.

935
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:21,066
- Hannah Montana?
- Yeah.

936
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,567
- And I was like,
"Really, bitch?"

937
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,300
-<i> Pero una pregunta.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Okay?

938
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,767
Would you rather me
sit there and go,

939
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,533
"Oh, honey,
you're fabulous."

940
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,467
- Like, I'm gonna say it,
and I'm gonna say it one time.

941
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,667
- Okay.

942
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,633
- It's so easy to talk
about a drag queen,

943
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,734
but it's so difficult
to be one.

944
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,333
- Honey, I know.

945
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,600
- It's amazing.
It's amazing.

946
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,700
I mean, for me,
drag is a female illusion,

947
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,133
and to make comments
about a plate

948
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,800
that I just bought
that actually helped me

949
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
reach the point
of female illusion is stupid,

950
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,166
because you bought
your titties too.

951
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,567
- Yes, I did, absolutely.

952
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:01,133
- So it's completely--
it's completely pointless,

953
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,667
because that's what we are.

954
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:06,066
And then to see that I'm getting
picked in the little details,

955
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,633
where Raja doesn't even
wear titties, is--

956
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,934
- She is tonight.

957
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:12,633
She's got something going on.

958
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,967
- Yeah, it's complicated.

959
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,433
- Okay, now let me explain
where I was coming from

960
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,533
so you understand.

961
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:19,500
I think you are
an amazingly talented queen.

962
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,333
I think you're gorgeous.

963
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,500
With all of you,

964
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,400
my job was to help you
get to the next level.

965
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,967
Tonight, your body
looks perfect to me.

966
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,867
Like, I would have no critique
of this, Alexis.

967
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:33,700
I know I have my issues,
and I try to dress accordingly,

968
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,600
so I kind of hide those flaws.

969
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,166
Why would you do something

970
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,834
that makes you
30 pounds heavier looking

971
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:39,934
when you don't need to?

972
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:41,066
That was my only issue.

973
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,433
I'm just here to be as real
as I can be,

974
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,667
minus my boobs.

975
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,533
And you want to rock
a breastplate, that's fine.

976
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:50,500
I grew up in New York City,
where drag queens don't do that.

977
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,066
So I do get your pageant drag.
I get it.

978
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,600
It's not that I don't get
anybody's drags.

979
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,734
I know regional drags
are different.

980
00:34:56,734 --> 00:35:00,133
But I just wanted to see things
switched up every now and then.

981
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:03,333
Tonight, you don't have it,
and you look beautiful.

982
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,600
- But I do--wearing--
I'm wearing titties.

983
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,467
- That's fine.
That's different.

984
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,066
- I love my titties,
and I work it out all the time.

985
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,767
- And you should.
- Bam, yes.

986
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,600
- Bam.
- I'm wearing a body pad, so...

987
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,367
[laughter]

988
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,300
- Now, this is an opportunity
for all the girls.

989
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
If you have something to say
to Michelle Visage,

990
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,166
now is your time.

991
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,333
- I thought you were mean.

992
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,133
I mean, that eyebrow
just kind of goes up,

993
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,333
and those cheekbones
are all up here.

994
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,400
When God painted
the Michelle doll,

995
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,633
he painted her fiercely,

996
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,533
so I just think you have
that look on your face.

997
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:33,400
- I was always the girl
at the club

998
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,100
where somebody would come up
and say,

999
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
"Why you look like that?
Why don't you smile?"

1000
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,133
And I'd be like,
"Why don't you get away?"

1001
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,166
- Actually, I just wanted
to commend her.

1002
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,533
I did enjoy
the consistent judging,

1003
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,867
and it seemed like
she wasn't temperamental,

1004
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,934
and then I really did get
a good vibe.

1005
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:50,633
There's a term called
"Stone Cold Carter"

1006
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:53,066
in the ballroom scene,
and it's for those,

1007
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,066
the mugs that don't smile.
- Uh-huh.

1008
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,767
The judges who--
who don't give any--

1009
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,533
- Well, her.
- Uh-huh.

1010
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,600
- It's not every judge
had a mug.

1011
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,900
- Well, Michelle Visage
is from the ballroom scene.

1012
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,533
- Yes, she is,
and I definitely related to her.

1013
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,533
- All right, now,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>

1014
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,567
are the best fans
in the whole wide worldwide net.

1015
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,066
- [laughs]
[snaps]

1016
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:17,734
- So here's some questions
that you've shemail, tweeted,

1017
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:21,767
or posted on our
Face-face-facebook fan page.

1018
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,967
The first question is
from David in New Hampshire,

1019
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:28,200
and it is for Mimi Imfurst.

1020
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Why do you always look
so scared?

1021
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,767
[laughter]

1022
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,667
[person speaks indistinctly]

1023
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,200
- I don't know.
Do I look--

1024
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,934
do I look so scared
all the time?

1025
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,200
- She's painted that way.

1026
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,567
- I'm surprised.

1027
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,133
I think it--
probably it relates back

1028
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,333
to during the competition.

1029
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,600
I think I definitely had
a lot of insecurities.

1030
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,333
- Did the competition scare you?

1031
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,967
- I scared--
I think I scared myself

1032
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:50,967
more than anything.

1033
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:54,700
I--I got lost in my own world

1034
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,333
of not trusting
that I have good ideas,

1035
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:01,133
and I let it be my demise.

1036
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:05,567
- All right, this next question
is for India Farrah

1037
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,867
from Anonymous
in northwest Indiana.

1038
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,567
Says, "I'm a 13-year-old
aspiring drag queen.

1039
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:15,200
What is your biggest piece
of advice you could give?"

1040
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,867
- Oh, wow.
- You started at 12.

1041
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,300
- Yes, I started
at the age of 12.

1042
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,500
- So basically you were
the Miley Cyrus of drag.

1043
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,967
[laughter]

1044
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,200
- Absolutely.

1045
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,567
Luckily my brother
is gay as well,

1046
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,066
so it was kind of easier,

1047
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,333
and with my family
being so supportive,

1048
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,834
that was really easy
for me to do it.

1049
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,667
So try to feel comfortable
in your own skin.

1050
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,767
Don't pay attention to, like,
the negative, like, comments,

1051
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:39,066
the bullshit.

1052
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,133
Let it go in one ear
and out the other.

1053
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,734
- All right, next we have
a question for Shangela.

1054
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:48,533
It's from Kayla G.
who wants to know,

1055
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,900
"While watching the show,
did you ever get sick

1056
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,467
of hearing yourself
say hallelu?"

1057
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:55,533
[laughter]

1058
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:59,233
- Actually no, because I like
to say, "I live in the lu,"

1059
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,367
because "hallelu" is more
than just a word to me.

1060
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,800
It's kind of the way
that I live.

1061
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,066
It's joyous.
- It's an attitude.

1062
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:05,500
- It's happy.
It's an attitude.

1063
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,934
It's a way of life...
- Yeah, it's a way of life.

1064
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:09,533
- To me, hallelu.
- Okay. Right on, right on.

1065
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:13,133
Joseph G. in Los Angeles
asks,

1066
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:17,367
"Carmen, have you seen J. Lo
since the taping?"

1067
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,433
- So I've been around
Jennifer Lopez in person,

1068
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,500
I mean, movie sets, concerts,
like...

1069
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,900
I went to her birthday party
impersonating her.

1070
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,066
Like, Marc asked me to come,
whatever.

1071
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,133
No.
Mm-mm.

1072
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,900
I usually get to see her
when she's, like, on tour

1073
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,567
or when she's doing, like,
a movie.

1074
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,066
If she's filming a movie,
it's like...

1075
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:36,200
I can be with her
for, like, a week

1076
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
because she's
at the same location.

1077
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Like, you know what I mean?

1078
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,967
But I haven't seen her.

1079
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:41,300
I'll see you soon, Jennifer.

1080
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,633
We're gonna do a video together,

1081
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,667
and we'll put it out there
and post it on Facebook

1082
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:47,166
to clear all the rumors.

1083
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,667
- Gorge.
All right.

1084
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,867
Now, the next question
is for Raja,

1085
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:55,166
and it is from Tommy
in Salt Lake.

1086
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,533
"Have you heard from Tyra Banks

1087
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:01,800
since your parody of her
on the Snatch Game?"

1088
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,266
Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.

1089
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:05,233
What do they call that?

1090
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,233
- Smissing.

1091
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,133
- [laughs]

1092
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,200
Tyra,
is there anything going on

1093
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,500
that you want
to tell us about?

1094
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,266
- What?
- Are you smissing too hard?

1095
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,567
- I think I smissed so hard,
my eyes bled, girl.

1096
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,433
- Oh, my goodness!

1097
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,066
- Mm-mm.

1098
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,266
Nope, haven't heard from her
at all.

1099
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,433
But, you know, I do hear
from Miss J all the time.

1100
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,266
He's like, "Walk back,
you fucking crazy...

1101
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,200
blah, blah, blah,"
just all through texts.

1102
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,367
Tyra did tweet me,

1103
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,734
but that was when the season
first started.

1104
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,266
- Okay.
- When the season--

1105
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,900
She hadn't seen me
do her parody yet.

1106
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,333
- Ooh.

1107
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,166
- Hope she has a sense of humor.
- She does.

1108
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,333
I know Tyra well enough,

1109
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,066
even though we're not
the bestest friends

1110
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:42,333
by any means,
but I do know her well enough

1111
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,066
that she would have
a great sense of humor about it.

1112
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:46,567
And, you know, she's funny.
She's crazy just like us.

1113
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:50,300
She's a big ol' drag queen,
so she gets it...

1114
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,734
I hope.

1115
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:53,900
- [laughs]

1116
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,266
- Now, Yara, I do have
a question for you.

1117
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:59,467
It's from Michael H.
in Los Angeles.

1118
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:02,133
"What did
your little person friend

1119
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,767
think of Yara Sofia?"

1120
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,066
- He love it.
You know what?

1121
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:11,066
I haven't received,
like, a bad comment

1122
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,433
or a bad feedback

1123
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,900
about the little person
performance.

1124
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,967
- Good. good.

1125
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:23,433
It's been a year of
unprecedented twists and turns,

1126
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:26,500
and if I could live
this season all over again,

1127
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,133
I wouldn't change a thing.

1128
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,066
Now, to those of you
out there watching,

1129
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,033
don't fuck it up.

1130
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:34,400

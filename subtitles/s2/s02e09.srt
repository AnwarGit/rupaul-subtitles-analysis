00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:03,734
- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:07,934
Transform these silver daddies
into your drag mamas.

3
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:10,467
Steven,
you're the mother of Raven.

4
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:12,000
- She thinks she's being cunty

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,300
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard?

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,967
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."

8
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,333
[laughter]

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,800
- I can tell
she's getting tired,

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,567
so I grab her
and take her to the back.

11
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,033
[cheers and applause]

12
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,633
- Raven, congratulations.

13
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,200
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,367
Two queens stand before me.

15
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:38,667
Jujubee.

16
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,166
Shante, you stay.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,266
- Thank you.

18
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:46,767
- Pandora, sashay away.

19
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,233
And tonight...

20
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,633
[feigning tears] I'd to thank
all the members of the Academy,

21
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,900
my personal tucker.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,200
The queens hit the red carpet.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,500
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,266
- I think I did my job.

25
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,734
- Who will be the biggest diva?

26
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:05,934
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...

27
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,066
[all gasping]

28
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,200
- Thank you.

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
- With extra special guest
judges,

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,633
Marissa Jaret Winokur
and Tatum O'Neal.

00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,934

[engines revving]

43
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,567
- Oh, my God, it is so empty.

44
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,066
- I know.

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,066
- Wow.

46
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,433
- We're down to the final four.

47
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,633
You definitely feel the lack of

48
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,066
other contestants in the room.

49
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,066
- "Lick this Boxx..."

50
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,734
- "Bitch."

51
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,400
- How do you guys feel about me
being in the bottom

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,066
last night with Pandora?

53
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,467
Did I deserve to go home?

54
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,333
- Off of just the lip-sync,

55
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,066
I thought
they were gonna choose Pandora.

56
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,867
- But what was
the reason behind that?

57
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,800
- My eyes were going to Pandora.

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
- I don't look at Pandora
and see a star.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,567
I look at you, and I see a star.

60
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,734
- I think her runway
should have put her

61
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:44,066
in the bottom two
a long time ago.

62
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,066
- Yes.

63
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,734
- She never, like,
sparkled to me.

64
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,600
- Who cares who Raven
thinks is a star?

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
I sure don't.

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,133
I'm sure she thinks
that she is a star.

67
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,433
And I sure don't.

68
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,400
- I mean, lookit.

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,467
This thing
was packed full of shit

70
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,467
and people all up on it.

71
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,400
And now there's four of us here.

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,233
I really miss my friends,
though.

73
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:06,367
- I would talk to my drag mother
every day at, like, 10:00.

74
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,133
- Do you talk
to your drag mother

75
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,934
more than your real mother?

76
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,900
- I don't talk
to my real mother at all.

77
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
- You don't?
- No, girl.

78
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,433
She abandoned me.

79
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,166
- My father died when I was 15.

80
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,834
Six months later,
my mother found somebody else,

81
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,967
and she left me to take care of
my two younger sisters

82
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,567
and to just grow up by myself,

83
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:28,200
and...I just stopped
being a kid.

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,266
I just want to thank my mother,
Charisma Jeneva Jackson Taye.

85
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,333
[siren]

86
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,934
- Ooh, girl!

87
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,433
You got shemail.

88
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,333
Hey, dolls, if you still think

89
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,867
Liza robbed Diana
of the Oscar in 1972;

90
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,834
if you look in the mirror
every morning and cry out,

91
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,600
"You like me!
You really like me!"

92
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,133
then maybe, just maybe,

93
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:55,567
you could be America's
next drag superstar.

94
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,700
[car engine racing]

95
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,567
- Hello, hello, hello.

96
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:01,667
- Hey, Ru.
- Good morning.

97
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,500
- Well, well, well.

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,400
You're the fantastic final four.

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,734
And you know
the next drag superstar

100
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,233
must possess a unique style,

101
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,433
and she wouldn't be caught dead

102
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:15,066
wearing the same dress
as another diva.

103
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,867
For today's mini-challenge,

104
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,200
you'll be given
identical outfits

105
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
and 30 minutes
to style and accessorize them

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,767
in a way to make them your own.

107
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:30,700
After that, I'll return to
decide which queen wore it best.

108
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,967
No cutting or gluing allowed.

109
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:34,967
- Oh, God.

110
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,533
- Ladies, make it fabulous

111
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,400
and make it your own.

112
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,433
I'll see you later.

113
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,934
30 minutes.

114
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,700
- Work.

115
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,900
<i>Trabaja.</i>

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
- Come on, Twila.

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,300
It's you and me.

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,800
- Are these dresses
all the same size?

119
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,767
I don't even think your tits
can even fit in here.

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,333
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.

121
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,467
- I'm gonna wear this hair.

122
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,467
- I gotta put
some lipstick on, at least.

123
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:12,133
- I look over and I see Juju
buffing makeup over her stubble.

124
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:16,100
[laughter]

125
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,700
- You guys laughing?

126
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,367
- Girl, we have on fuckin' wigs.

127
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,900
- [laughing]
And not a stitch of makeup.

128
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,200
- I put some makeup on.
Girl, look at me.

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,533
- Ew! You better put lashes on,
you dirty whore.

130
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,367
- I don't need no makeup.

131
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,100
I got fish face.

132
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,066
I'm daytime. I'm real.

133
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:38,066
- Yeah, girl,
you look like trout, okay?

134
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:41,467
- Hello, hello, hello.

135
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,333
- Did En Vogue
get back together?

136
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,367
- Yeah!

137
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:46,633
- You girls work fast.

138
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,667
Look at you.

139
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,934
I can't believe
you got up in full drag.

140
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:50,934
- Mama.

141
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,100
- And she's
padded and everything.

142
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,433
You've got the leggings on.

143
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,600
Tell me about your decision
to do leggings with this.

144
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,834
- You know what it was?

145
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,667
I didn't have time to really
hide the pad lines,

146
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,600
and I wanted to kind of go
a little bit more R&amp;B with it.

147
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,834
- It does elongate you.

148
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,433
Now, Raven, you chose
all black accessories.

149
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,633
You look like a spy.

150
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,867
Are you a spy, girl?

151
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,567
- I was just going for a
little dark sophistication,

152
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,266
with a little hint
of last year's Rihanna.

153
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,900
- And you went
for scrunch boots.

154
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,500
- Yeah, well,
they came all the way up,

155
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,734
so I pushed them down.

156
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,500
- I've never been
a fan of the scrunch boots,

157
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,433
unless the lady has legs
as long as mine are, you know.

158
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,633
Now, Tatianna, are those
two holes in your ears?

159
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,133
- I have two holes,
so I thought,

160
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,533
why not match it up?

161
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,066
- Tell me about
your silver shoes.

162
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,333
- Well, I didn't want
to do a black shoe,

163
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,834
and I thought,
why not do a silver pump?

164
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,967
Give a little bit
of sparkle down south.

165
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:39,867
- I think that maybe Tatianna
over-accessorized.

166
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,600
She looks like
a 99 cent store mess.

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,633
- All right, now, miss Tyra,

168
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,533
you made yourself a clutch.

169
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,300
- Yeah, I didn't have one.

170
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,066
- Uh-huh, and you decided
to go the classy lady--

171
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,200
ladies who lunch.

172
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,467
From the funeral to the wake
to the after party

173
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,567
and then on to the club.

174
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,200
- And then to pick up
the children to go home.

175
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,567
- And then to pick up
the children.

176
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,600
It's a very elegant look

177
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,433
that any lady
at home watching

178
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,867
would feel very comfortable in.

179
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,100
- Thank you.

180
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,567
- All right, ladies,
the queen who wore it best is...

181
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,500
Tyra.

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,600
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.

183
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,900
Ladies, exciting news.

184
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,600
For your main challenge,

185
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,500
you've all been nominated for
the First Annual Diva Awards!

186
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,567
[all scream]

187
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,400
Yes! Yes!

188
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,500
Now, the Diva Awards
are your chance

189
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,600
to show some serious
awards show realness.

190
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,200
You'll need to pull together
three different outfits

191
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,700
for three different
Diva Award ceremonies.

192
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,800
First up, the Teen Diva Awards,

193
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,934
where you must dress
as a hot teen queen...

194
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:52,300
using clothes provided by
the House of Infinite Radness.

195
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,066
Then it's the Diva
D.C. Press Awards,

196
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:58,800
where you'll be serving
some executive realness,

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
Washington, D.C., Style.

198
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,667
And finally, the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza Awards,

199
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,867
where you'll be expected
to gag us

200
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,300
with your glamour and eleganza.

201
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,800
I'll be back later

202
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
to see how your pre-show
preparations are going.

203
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,900
Gentlemen, start your engines.

204
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,900
And may the best woman win!

205
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,266
Go!

206
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,166
[laughing]

207
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,500
- The first thing I saw
was lime green fur.

208
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,800
So I grabbed
every piece of fur that I saw.

209
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,300
- It's nerve-wracking,

210
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,767
because you don't know what the
others are gonna pull out.

211
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,800
Now, in this competition,
it's getting to,

212
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,233
they're looking for the best.

213
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,567
You don't know
what each person is gonna do.

214
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,834
Our challenge this week is
to create three different looks

215
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,066
at the Diva Awards.

216
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,633
A hot, teen look
for the Teen Diva Awards.

217
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,834
Executive realness
for the D.C. Diva Press Awards.

218
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,867
And a glamorous red carpet look

219
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,333
for the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza.

220
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,800
- I had something like this
in high school, actually.

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,734
- Me too.
- [laughing]

222
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,433
- I felt like the biggest fag.

223
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:10,900
- Oh, you wore it as a boy?

224
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,333
- I didn't go to school
as a girl, Tatianna.

225
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,533
- [laughing]

226
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,767
- Okay?

227
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:20,266
Tatianna is stuck
in that realm of, "I am a girl."

228
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,834
I think, as a drag queen,
you should culture yourself.

229
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,066
Maybe I'll go all, like,
Mary Kate on everybody

230
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,834
and just wear 30 things at once.

231
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,066
You should be a chameleon.

232
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,800
If I lose to you...

233
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,867
I'll be fine.

234
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,333
- I want to win this challenge.

235
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,266
- Girl, I want
to win<i> a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> challenge.</i>

236
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,467
We have to be number one
and number two.

237
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,734
- Them winning is not an option.

238
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,300
- I think that Juju and I

239
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,166
will both help each other out
as much as we can

240
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,767
to make sure
that we make it to the top.

241
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:50,266
- Is this Hollywood elegance?

242
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,567
- I think so.

243
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,066
- RuPaul keeps repeating,

244
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,900
"Charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent."

245
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,066
I think I have that.

246
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,200
I think Raven has that.

247
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,166
I know the other girls carry
some of those traits,

248
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,333
but I don't think
they have the full package.

- I'm sorry.

256
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,000
- No, do it.

257
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,333
You have a beautiful voice.

258
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,533

00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,467
- Over there trying to read.

261
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,734
- What do you feel about
missing Jeremiah's first day?

262
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:35,633
- I'm sad
that I'm gonna miss it.

263
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,867
I'm praying that his mom
takes pictures.

264
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,200
My son is starting
preschool today,

265
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,300
and I'm missing out
on his first day of school.

266
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,433
So I'm really gonna, like--

267
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,633
I'm, like, sad about it.

268
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,600
It's been nine weeks
since I've seen my son.

269
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,633
It's just driving me crazy.

270
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,934
I miss Jeremiah so much.

271
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,333
But I know that me being here

272
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,734
and getting a chance
to give him a better life

273
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,066
is all worth it.

274
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,066
Yes. You better do it, Tyra.

275
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,834
Mm-hmm.

276
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,767
- I sat and thought
for a majority of the morning,

277
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,400
thinking of the silhouette
I wanted to work with,

278
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
how I was going to utilize
the fabric that I ended up with.

You never waste
your time thinking.

- Do I have feathers
all over my face?

282
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,367
'Cause they're
all over the floor.

283
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,333
- I can feel it.

284
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,734
- Sorry, but I want
to be fabulous.

285
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:32,800
- I just see fuzz flying
all over the fuckin' room.

286
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,734
And I'm like,
"what the fuck Is this?"

287
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:40,100
Tyra looks like she skinned
all of the Muppets

288
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,567
and is making a gown out of fur.

289
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:47,233
- I don't know
what the deal with her is.

290
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,767
I don't if she's
just playing a game.

291
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,166
Maybe she's just making this
just to kind of throw us off.

292
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,667
- Fabulous, darling.

293
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,233
Fabulous.

294
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:01,133
- I've never made
a gown like that before.

295
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,233
It's gonna have
more of a complicated,

296
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,266
more expensive look,

297
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,800
but it's really only, like,

298
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,066
three pieces of fabric
and some hot glue.

299
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,200
- Hello, divas!

300
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,300
- all: Hi.

301
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,066
- Oh, wow, look at this.

302
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,867
You're all busy at work here.

303
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,767

304

Hey, Tyra.

306

- Hey, Ru.
- Look at you down there.

307
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,300
Now, which one
of the awards shows is that for?

308
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,367
- Elegant evening gowns.

309
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,367
So I want to be in a gown,

310
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,533
but I want it to stand out.

311
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,233
- Do you feel
that you're the one to beat?

312
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,433
Do you feel that confident?

313
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,800
- I do feel that confident.

314
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,633
I've been challenging myself
and making myself better.

315
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,934
- Yeah,
I've got to mention this.

316
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,900
Now, you're here,
and the fur is flying around,

317
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,333
and it's itching your face.

318
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,066
Now, that may be a red flag

319
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,367
for how it will perform
on the red carpet.

320
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,567
You see what I'm saying?

321
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,500
You might need to vacuum it
before you wear it.

322
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,834
- [laughing]

323
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,166
- Thank you, Tyra.

324

- Are you ready
for the biggest night

325
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,767
of your psychological life?

326
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:58,867
- It is pretty psychological.

327
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,934
- It's very psychological.

328
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:03,333
- So I see three
different ladies over there.

329
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,633
- I'm debating on my executive.

330
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:06,834
- Uh-huh.

331
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,633
- Most likely, I'm gonna
be going with this one.

332
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:12,867
- What says D.C. Diplomat
Press Awards to you?

333
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,133
- To me,
it just kind of reminds me

334
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,066
of something
that Sarah Palin would wear.

335
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,133
- 'Cause Sarah Palin
is your idol, and you--

336
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,200
- Oh, yes, I love her.

337
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,633
- Really?
- Please.

00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,100
- Everything that you've
learned about drag,

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,400
about yourself
up until this moment,

341
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
you have to put
into this challenge.

342
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,934
This is the big one,

343
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,066
and you gotta bring it.

- Hi, mama.

347
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,333
- Wow, what do you
got going on here?

348
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,100
Is this
for your Hollywood eleganza?

349
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,166
- Yes.

350
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,066
- It still seems
a little understated here.

351
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:47,667
What are you planning to do
to Juju it up?

352
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:48,633
- You just said it.

353
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,166
I'm just gonna Juju it up.

354
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,300
- Uh-huh.

355
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,867
Last week, you did wind up
in the bottom two,

356
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,767
and the stakes are oh, so high.

357
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,100
- I know.

358
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
- Well, listen,
you keep on working it, mama.

359
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Stay down. Stay down.

360
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Stay hood.

361
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,166
- Stay here.

362
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,533
- Stay here, that's right.

363
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,400
All right.

364
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,333
Hey, Tatianna.
- Hello.

365
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,433
- I see you over here
pondering your outfits here.

366
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,233
- Yes.
- What are we looking at?

367
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,533
This is your teen outfit.

368
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,100
- No.
- What is it?

369
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,166
- That is for
the Hollywood red carpet.

370
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,834
- Extravaganza.

371
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm just a little worried
about the cha-cha of this here.

372
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,567
What do you think Santino
will say about this?

373
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,367
- I've never done anything
like that before.

374
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,800
- That's not an excuse, is it?

375
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,100
You never--just because you
haven't done it, doesn't mean--

376
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,166
- Well, they haven't seen it,

377
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,567
so they haven't
commented on anything.

378
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,567
- Look, Tatianna,
we're at that place.

379
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:39,700
You gotta bring it.

380
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,767
You're under double scrutiny.

381
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,166
Triple scrutiny.
- Yeah.

382
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,700
- Because you have three
different looks

383
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,500
and three different
opportunities to be criticized.

384
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,200
- See, I think of it
as the positive:

385
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,066
You have three different chances
to wow the judges

386
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,433
rather than just one.

387
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,567
- Well, listen, I don't want
to throw you off your game,

388
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,800
but I'm telling you, these
bitches are coming for you.

389
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,100
- Yeah.

390
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,367
- If you were ever gonna pull
something out of your ass,

391
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,467
now would be the time to do it.

392
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,300
Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.

393
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,433
- Ladies, gather round.

394
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:11,700
Tomorrow, at the Diva Awards,

395
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,367
our extra-special guest judges

396
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:20,300
will be Tony Award-winner
Marissa Jaret Winokur

397
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
from<i> Hairspray.</i>

398
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,800
That's right.

399
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,133
And Oscar-winner Tatum O'Neal.

400
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,467
- [gasps]

401
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:33,300
- Yes, we have people who have
snatched trophies hunting.

402
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,633
- We're having a Tony Award
winner and an Oscar winner

403
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:39,100
sitting there judging us
on how we maintain ourself

404
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,667
at an awards ceremony.

405
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,934
It's no joke.

406
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:45,300
- Now, listen, I know you have
a lot on your plate.

407
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:52,066
But there's just one more
little twist, Tina, darling.

408
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:54,600
Now, before you hit
the awards show circuit,

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,867
the four of you
will need to perform

410
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,867
a Diva Awards opening number.

411
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,800
The song and outfits
have been chosen,

412
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,767
but you need to work together
on the choreography.

413
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,066
Now, Tyra, because you
won the mini challenge,

414
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:14,567
I'm leaving you in charge
of the opening number.

415
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,333
- I'm in charge of the girls?

416
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,734
- You're in charge
of the opening number.

417
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:19,066
- Hi, mama.

418
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,066
- Working in a group
wouldn't be my first choice,

419
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,633
but I'm gonna work hard,

420
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,500
'cause there's no way in hell

421
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,066
that I'm gonna let
someone else fail

422
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,266
and put me in the bottom two.

423
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,066
- Now, tomorrow
on the main stage,

424
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,700
I expect you girls to be
dripping with charisma,

425
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,667
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

426
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,433
[feigning tears]
And finally,

427
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,867
I'd like to thank
all the members of the Academy,

428
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,800
my personal tucker,

429
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,567
and last, but not least,
to my four little darling divas.

430
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:53,266
I just want to say,
don't fuck it up.

431
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,066
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

432
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,900
Good-bye. Good luck.

433
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,166
- Bye, Ru.
- And keep it real.

434
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,734
- What song is it?

435
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,066
- I don't know.

436
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,734
- The last time Tyra
had to work in a group,

437
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,467
she wanted to leave her group.

438
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,066
It's a recipe for disaster.

439
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,166
- I thought it was my name
for a minute.

440
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,066
- The four of us
have to do a number

441
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,433
for the opening
of the Diva Awards.

442
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,600
Am I happy about it? No.

443
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,500
'Cause it takes time away from
me getting my shit together.

444
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,667
- So we're gonna--

445
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,967
okay, so we're gonna
walk out to the intro

446
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,066
and stand by our letter
like you are?

447
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,467
Right to the side of it?

448
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,166
- Do you want us to all
have the same pose,

449
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,500
or do you want us
to all have different poses,

450
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,066
but we just
don't break those poses

451
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,633
until it gets to our line?

452
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,600
- Um...

453
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,066
- So we look at Tyra,

454
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,166
and we're trying to figure out
what the direction is for this.

455
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,667
And she's not really giving
anything,

456
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,066
and then she does,
and we're like...okay...

457
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,266
- We walk out.

458
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,467
When does this happen?

459
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,400
- At the beginning.
- When what happens?

460
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,533
- Right at the beginning?
- This is the end.

461
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:00,900
- Oh, this is the end.

462
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,600
- I think it showed that Tyra

463
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,233
isn't the best
with choreography,

464
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,867
because there
wasn't choreography.

465
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,133
It was just kind of,

466
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,300
"We're gonna pose
and then we're gonna spin

467
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,700
"and then we're gonna pose.

468
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,300
And then we're gonna
stack letters and pose."

469
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,934
And it was very posey.

470
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,133
- Who's singing this part?

471
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,266
- We'll figure it out later.

472
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,567
- I'm the one with the attitude.

473
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,333
- Oh, I guess
I'll just stay here.

474
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,333
- Our rehearsal was a hot mess.

475
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,200
And so I'm really hoping that we
can pull this off tomorrow.

476
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,066
Thank you.

477
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,367
[alarm beeps]

478
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,166
- Just me.

479
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,100
- You are so shady.
- Bitch, please.

480
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,967
- Is everybody confident with
the things that they have?

481
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,900
- Yeah, I couldn't
sleep last night, though.

482
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,066
I was sitting there thinking,

483
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,734
what the hell?

484
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:55,100
I wasn't happy with my teen
dream whatever.

485
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,433
- I hope this shirt fits me.

486
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:02,200
- I'm so scared
about this dress.

487
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,934
I wanted to make a full gown,

488
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,367
completely made out of fur.

489
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,734
But I realize
that I don't like it,

490
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,767
so now I have to change my
entire plans

491
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,767
and come up with a new look.

492
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,967
- So today
determines the top three,

493
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,066
and I'm gonna be there.

494
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,934
- I definitely think
that I deserve to be here.

495
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,600
I think I work very, very hard.

496
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,367
- I know I deserve to.

497
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,734
I worked really hard,
and I've grown a lot

498
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,066
since I've been here.

499
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,400
And I think
that they know it too.

500
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,333
- You know, I may have had
to lip-synch for my life twice,

501
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,767
but it got to the point where
the challenges got harder,

502
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,734
and I won two of them.

503
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,500
- Y'all won two.
You won two.

504
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,633
You got one.
And I have zero.

505
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,667
I do not want to be
in the bottom two again.

506
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,066
You know, this is gonna be
a third time, if I do.

507
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,333
And last I remember,
Sahara did it three times,

508
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,600
and she went home.

509
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,700
- Now, who do you think's
gonna be in the top three?

510
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,266
- Me.
- Me.

511
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,066
- Name all three people.

512
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,300
- Why don't you start then?

513
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,266
- Okay, I think it's gonna be
me, you and Tyra.

514
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,433
Tyra has shown consistency.

515
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,767
You have brought
a sense of energy.

516
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,066
I have given them
what they are looking for.

517
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,433
And it seems like Tatianna

518
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:12,834
hasn't done
what they want from her yet.

519
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:15,133
So, Tatianna, who do you think
is in the top three?

520
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,100
- Um, I hope it's me.

521
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,633
And that's really all
I have to say on the matter.

522
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,667
- Tyra.

523
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,834
- I would have
to agree with you.

524
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:27,000
But things could change
if she pulls it together today.

525

- Jujubee.

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- You know, I--I hate
to be like this,

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,500
but Tatianna, don't hate me.

530

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,367
- But I have to agree
with you, Raven.

532

Don't be mad at me, girl.

533
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,000
- I've known for a while

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,934
that all the girls
don't think I'm competition.

535
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,667
But a lot of those girls who
thought I wasn't competition

have gone home.

You're not

the aura of hot teen actress.

- Gorgeous.

- No.

00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,734

I lost a few beads,

684
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,433
but hopefully they'll end up
on the runaway,

685
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,467
and a couple of the girls
will fall on them.

686

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,567
- I'm feeling fabulous.

705
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,567
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to your fans?

706
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,233
- To my fans,
just keep dreaming,

707
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,600
and remember,
if you can't love yourself,

708
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,133
how in the hell are you gonna
love anybody else?

709
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,200
- Tyra. Ohh.

710
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,500
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.

711
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,800
- It's very Rita Hayworth.

712
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,767
<i>Gilda.</i>

713
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,700
- Yes,<i> Gilda!</i>

714
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,133
- Welcome, ladies.

715
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:28,867
An acceptance speech
is an essential part

716
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,367
of any awards show.

717
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:36,200
And now, I want each of you
to share yours with the judges.

718
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,467
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...

719
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:44,900
Tatianna.

720
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,934
- First off, thank you.

721
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,767
I want to start
by thanking my mother.

722
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,066
Without her,
I wouldn't be here today,

723
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,700
and without her genes,

724
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,967
I might not
have been here today.

725
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,333
I did me to the fullest.

726
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,400
And that is why I'm standing
here today accepting this award.

727
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,433
Thank you.

728
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,066
- Thank you, Tatianna.

729
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,467
- Thank you.

730
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:10,700
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...Raven.

731
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,900
- Oh!

732
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,200
[laughter]

733
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,834
[sniffling]

734
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:21,200
Thank you so much.

735
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,533
I, first of all,
have to thank God,

736
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:27,867
for without Him,
I would not be here.

737
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,066
I also have to thank RuPaul

738
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,200
for putting a fire
under my butt.

739
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,367
And I also have to thank
all of my fans

740
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,734
who have gotten me
to where I am today.

741
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,667
Thank you.

742
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,533
- Thank you, Raven.

743
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:46,066
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...

744
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,734
[drum roll]

745
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:49,133
Jujubee.

746
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,200
- [hyperventilating]

747
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,166
Thank you so much.

748
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,834
First and foremost,
I'd like to thank my Creator,

749
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,934
King Jesus and God Himself.

750
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,567
I'd like to thank my father

751
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,734
for just believing in me
and taking his time to teach me.

752
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,266
Mother, I know you're out there,

753
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,467
and I know you're watching.

754
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,700
It's okay.

755
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,066
One day, we'll be
back together again.

756
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,066
This is my diva moment,

757
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,934
and I am so glad
to share this moment with you.

758
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,967
Thank you so much.

759
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,233
- Thank you.

760
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,533
- [laughing]

761
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:24,233
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...

762
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,233
[drum roll]

763
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,433
Tyra Sanchez.

764
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,300
- Wow, I didn't even know
I was nominated.

765
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,333
[laughter]

766
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,567
First and foremost,

767
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,500
I have to dedicate my award
to my son.

768
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,166
It's you who make me smile.

769
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,367
It's you who keeps me going.

770
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,867
It's you who makes me motivated.

771
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,600
And I just want him to know
that if he believes,

772
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,567
all dreams will come true.

773
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,900
[whispers]
Thank you.

774
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,700
[feigning tears] I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.

775
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,066
[laughter]

776
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:54,100
[applause]

777
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:57,967
All right, now it's time
for the judges' critique.

778
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,734
Tatianna,
I want to start with you.

779
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:00,700
- Hello.

780
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
- Did you intentionally
do Sarah Palin?

781
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,633
- No, I wasn't intentionally
going for that,

782
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,066
but I do love her hair.

783
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,133
- Interestingly enough,

784
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,233
I think the sexiest
we've seen you look

785
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,600
was doing
the executive chic in D.C.

786
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,333
The fact that you're
hiding it a little

787
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,066
made you look more beautiful.

788
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,633
- I'm not in love
with the ruffle.

789
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,433
It's a little too big on top.

790
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,166
It's not coming off as,
like, a real garment for me.

791
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,600
- The red carpet, now,
that's where you got me.

792
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
Unfortunately, James St. James,

793
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,734
he's been holding a mic
a long time.

794
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,800
Or we don't know what he's
been holding, but what...

795
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,600
- [laughing]
Among other things.

796
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,633
- Among other things.

797
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,000
But he really got into that mic,

798
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,467
and he was like,
"So, what do you think?"

799
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,467
and you were like, "Well..."

800
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,533
- It did seem like you were

801
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:40,934
soft-spoken
and was lacking confidence.

802
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,734
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.

803
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,133
- I have to say
I really do love this dress.

804
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:46,200
- It's actually sheer.

805
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,066
The beads cover your...

806
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,066
naughty parts.

807
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,300
- When you wear it,

808
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,166
you're of course
supposed to be a<i> real</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman.</i>

809
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,967
- Oh, you mean
for a biological woman.

810
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,633
- [laughing]
A biological woman.

811
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,133
I'm a psychological woman.

812
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,266
- Oh, okay.
[laughter]

813
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,567
- But...

814
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,700
- You were giving me the first
woman four-star general.

815
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,066
It was very severe
and believable,

816
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,300
and I--I love that.

817
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,834
- I love it--a four-star general
with a pearl necklace.

818
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,734
- Yeah. [laughing]
- That's hot.

819
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:15,867
- Your backstage was, I think,

820
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,900
the best
out of the girls for me.

821
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,400
You were accessible,
you were funny.

822
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,867
- There are no small people,
just big bitches.

823
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,633
- Funny as that was,
then you turned around

824
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,800
and gave an acceptance speech

825
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,367
that was completely
from the heart.

826
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,967
So we got to see all the
different spectrum of you,

827
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,066
which we saw
in all the outfits too.

828
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:35,533
- Thank you.

829
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,100
- Jujubee.

830
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,533
- Hi.

831
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,700
- Your Diva Awards presentation.

832
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
You missed a few steps.

833
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,500
- Of course, you know, I--

834
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,934
I have two left feet.

835
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,734
- I was like,
"Oh, no, she's messing up."

836
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:49,400
But then you, like,
camped it up so much

837
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,767
that then I kind of couldn't
keep my eyes off of you.

838
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,100
You really recovered well.

839
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,567
And then this look, I did think,

840
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:56,834
"Oh, this is a costume.

841
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,133
"This isn't what someone
would really wear

842
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,400
to an awards ceremony."

843
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,166
- I thought what Juju
brought tonight

844
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,166
was nerve.

845
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,600
I thought it was very nervy.

846
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,233
to go with a hip-hop,
urban look

847
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,066
when it's not
what you would expect.

848
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,867
It was really
the only true surprise

849
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,066
that we saw.

850
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,900
- Then we got
your acceptance speech.

851
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,433
- Mother,
I know you're out there,

852
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,066
and I know you're watching.

853
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,100
It's okay.

854
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,867
One day,
we'll be back together again.

855
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,166
We all know I don't have
a relationship with my mother.

856
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,066
But she put me here on earth,
so I have to thank her.

857
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,066
- I can relate.

858
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,433
My dad wasn't there, uh,

859
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,967
for my, uh,
winning the Academy Award.

860
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,500
So--but he was busy and stuff,

861
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,400
so it's not like I
hold it against him.

862
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,300
But, so, but you know, you'd--
I was eight years old,

863
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
so you'd want someone there.

864
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,900
So I get it,
you know what I mean?

865
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,066
And--but I love that you had the
presence of mind to say that.

866
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,600
- Yes. Thank you.

867
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,133
- Thank you.

868
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,166
- Hi, Tyra.

869
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,300
- Hi.

870
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,734
- I've gotta tell you,

871
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:53,100
the fact that you've been here
all these weeks,

872
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,300
and you were able
to save this dress till now--

873
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,433
I just want to give you a
standing ovation for that alone.

874
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,600
- Thank you.

875
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,934
- Were there any other times
when you thought,

876
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:06,900
"Okay, I'm gonna wear
the ice green today?"

877
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,166
- Every time I would get ready
for a challenge,

878
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,834
I would see it,
and I'm thinking,

879
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,400
"It's not time; when it's time,
it'll call my name."

880
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,066
[laughter]

881
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,900
- And you're just
so impressive this week.

882
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,333
I love that plum cocktail dress.

883
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,333
I notice that you
covered the shoes.

884
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,300
You know, you just know
how to wear clothes.

885
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,233
- That was my favorite teen
outfit.

886
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:29,066
That dress was exactly right.

887
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:32,600
And then the hair
was so very editorial.

888
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,667
- Your acceptance speech,
it was,

889
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:35,900
I think, my favorite tonight.

890
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,667
I have seen a lot of growth
in your stage presence.

891
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,367
Your confidence, your calmness,

892
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,934
the way you spoke
was really there.

893
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,567
- Well, thank you, ladies.

894
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,333
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

895
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,100
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,

896
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,133
the judges and I
will deliberate.

897
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,834
You may leave the stage.

898
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,934
[car engine starts]

899
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,667
- All right,
here comes the hard part.

900
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,834
Let's start with Tatianna.

901
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:07,266
There's something about Tatianna
that feels unfinished,

902
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,200
like her dress.

903
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,300
Here's the thing:

904
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,533
when you've got a body
like Tatianna,

905
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,767
you don't have to do much.

906
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:17,367
If you're asked to bring
red carpet realness,

907
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:20,333
don't come in something
that's a little too slutty,

908
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,867
a little too obvious--

909
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,667
and homemade.

910
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,266
- But there was a positive about
her Washington, D.C., look.

911
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,600
- I thought that was
her best look,

912
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
because she wasn't
leaning on her looks.

913
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,300
She was bringing something else
to the table--

914
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,500
some thought and some fun.

915
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,600
- I think she has a spark.

916
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,200
Even her just
standing there smiling,

917
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,066
like, my eyes are drawn to her.

918
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,400
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,066
- Like, there's no question
why she made it this far.

920
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,266
- She's gorgeous.

921
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,533
- Yes, she is gorgeous.

922
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,500
- But you've got people
who are dropping into character,

923
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,266
who are like, you know,
have got some,

924
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,834
like, really good,
off-the-cuff repartee,

925
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,867
so it isn't just
about a beautiful face.

926
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,266
- The real question is,

927
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,066
does Tatianna have what it takes

928
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,266
to be America's
next drag superstar?

929
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,333
- She got the beauty,

930
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,500
she got the body;

931
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,400
I don't believe
she has the personality

932
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,367
or the taste level
or the sassy humor.

933
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,500
- Let's go to Jujubee.

934
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,266
You know, Jujubee has this
intellect about her

935
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:14,266
that feels beyond
any of the girls in the room.

936
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,600
But she sometimes
relies on this sort of

937
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,934
"I perform for you"
type of character

938
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,400
that is sort of one-dimensional.

939
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,867
- No, I totally disagree.

940
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,066
I think she's an actress.

941
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,400
She's got some spunk about her.

942
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,100
Her minus: I think she made
a poor choice on her last dress.

943
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,333
I don't know if that's worth
being sent home for.

944
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,433
- Raven.

945
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,900
- I just was drawn to her,

946
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,233
just because she
seemed like somebody

947
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,767
who's worked very hard, who's--

948
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,133
who sort of gets it,
who is funny.

949
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,633
- Well, I've gotten to be a
bigger fan of Raven's

950
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:42,900
as the show's gone on.

951
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,166
Every week, the onion peels back
a little more.

952
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,200
- Yeah.

953
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,567
- And what you see
gets more interesting.

954
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:49,767
- It's so tough, 'cause I--

955
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,734
I mean, the same thing
that I love about Raven

956
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,900
is the thing
that could be her weakness,

957
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,533
and it's that hard edge.

958
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,066
- All right, now, Tyra.

959
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,734
- I loved her from the minute
that she walked on.

960
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,300
She just got me, man.

961
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,066
Like, I just really
looked at her,

962
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:05,066
and I was like, "Star, winner."

963
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,467
She does need
to work on her voice.

964
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:07,533
- She's gotten better,

965
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,900
and the speech she gave tonight

966
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,700
was funnier and softer than
anything else she's delivered.

967
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
- That's true.

968
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I've never changed my voice.

969
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,200
I think people
hear me differently

970
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,266
when I'm in drag.

971
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:18,467
But I've never change my voice.

972
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,467
Never have.

973
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,433
- You have a very--

974
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,900
you know,
your voice matches you.

975
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

976
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:24,900
- He's 21.

977
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,233
I can't imagine going through...

978
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,266
this at 21.

979
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,767
And with a son, to say,

980
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:29,834
"I'm gonna do this"?

981
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,066
I think that shows more maturity

982
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,700
than anybody else on that stage,

983
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,633
being able to say,
"I have a child,

984
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,834
"I'm bringing him into this
amazing world

985
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,233
"and showing him
you can really do--

986
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:42,200
this is truly proving
you can do whatever you want."

987
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,734
All right, silence!

988
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:48,700
I have made my decision.

989
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,600
Bring back my girls.

990
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,467
Welcome back, ladies.

991
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:59,200
Now, awards are a funny thing.

992
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,400
We lie and say it's an honor
just to be nominated.

993
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,767
But deep down, we all want
to snatch that trophy.

994
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,900
And yet,
what matters in this world

995
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,233
is charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.

996
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,734
Based on that criteria,
I've made some decisions.

997
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Raven...

998
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,633
you're safe.

999
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,066
- Thank you.

1000
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:28,066
- You may leave the stage.

1001
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,400
- Thank you.

1002
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,066
- I'm top three.

1003
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,467
I'm excited.

1004
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:35,700
But I should have won.

1005
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
- The winner of this week's
challenge is...

1006
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,300
Tyra Sanchez.

1007
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,467
[applause]

1008
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:46,867
Congratulations.

1009
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:50,934
You have won a feature photo
spread in<i> Paper</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>

1010
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,166
You may leave the stage.

1011
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,500
- I'm not satisfied
being in the top three.

1012
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,767
My goal is to win.

1013
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:03,767
- Jujubee...
Tatianna...

1014
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,967
the two of you
are up for elimination.

1015
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,834
- Once again,
I'm in the bottom two.

1016
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm so disappointed.

1017
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,066
- When I hear
that I'm in the bottom two,

1018
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,467
I'm not surprised.

1019
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,967
I'm really just trying
to pull this out.

1020
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:17,533
- Ladies,
this is your last chance

1021
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:23,734
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.

1022
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,633
The time has come...

1023
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:31,567
for you to lip-synch
for your life.

1024
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,800
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.

1060
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,166
- Ladies...

1061
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:09,033
I've made my decision.

1062
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:17,500
Jujubee...

1063
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,467
Shante, you stay.

1064
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,033
- [whispers]
Thank you.

1065
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:25,300
I am in the final three.

1066
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,533
Girl!

1067
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:30,367
I was just like this,
like, gay boy with a dream.

1068
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:31,734
You know?

1069
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,333
- Tatianna...

1070
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:39,700
you made this competition
fun and fresh and young.

1071
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,100
And we all owe you
a debt of gratitude.

1072
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,834
For that, I have just two words.

1073
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,400
[tearful]
Thank you.

1074
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,200
- Thank you.

1075
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,367
- Thank you.

1076
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,467
- Thank you.

1077
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:57,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1081
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:04,934
And look at my skirt.

1082
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,400
It's short as hell.

1083
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,300
[laughter]
Ha ha!

1084
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,800
[laughing]
Bye.

1085
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,533
You know, to the people who said
that I wasn't drag enough,

1086
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,967
just because
I have natural beauty

1087
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,600
doesn't mean
I'm not a drag queen.

1088
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,633
I didn't have to put on pounds
of makeup to be pretty.

1089
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,900
I think that bothered
some people here,

1090
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,967
but that's their issue.

1091
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,400
I know what I've got.

1092
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,467
I know that I am a drag queen,

1093
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:30,066
and one of the top drag queens,

1094
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:31,934
thank you very much.

1095
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:36,800
- And then there were three.

1096
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800

Tyra, Jujubee, Raven.

1099
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:51,767
Next week, one of you will be
crowned the next drag superstar.

1100
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:55,066
Until then, remember:

1101
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:56,200
If you can't love yourself,

1102
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,066
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1103
00:41:58,066 --> 00:41:59,433
Can I get an amen in here?

1104
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,934
- all: Amen.

1105
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,533
- All right,
now let the music play.
